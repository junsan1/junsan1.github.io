# Keepwell Agreement

A Keepwell Agreement, sometimes referred to as a comfort letter or maintain-well agreement, is a contractual arrangement typically used in [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md) and [debt](../d/debt.md) issuance, particularly among multinational corporations. This agreement is designed to provide a subsidiary or affiliate company [assurance](../a/assurance.md) of financial support from a [parent company](../p/parent_company.md) or a more financially [robust](../r/robust.md) entity. This [assurance](../a/assurance.md) is not an outright guarantee but rather a promise to maintain certain [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) conditions to ensure the subsidiary can meet its [obligations](../o/obligation.md).

## Origin and Purpose

The [parent company](../p/parent_company.md), usually possessing a stronger [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md), agrees to ensure that the subsidiary remains “well-kept” in terms of its [financial health](../f/financial_health.md). This could involve maintaining certain [financial ratios](../f/financial_ratios.md) or providing necessary funding if required. The intention behind a Keepwell Agreement is to provide comfort to bondholders, creditors, and investors regarding the financial stability and [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) of the borrowing entity.

### Key Features

1. **Non-binding [Assurance](../a/assurance.md):** Unlike a guarantee, a Keepwell Agreement typically does not create a direct financial [liability](../l/liability.md) for the [parent company](../p/parent_company.md). It serves more as a moral commitment rather than a legal obligation.
2. **Financial Covenants:** The agreement may include specific covenants about maintaining [net worth](../n/net_worth.md), [debt](../d/debt.md)-to-[equity](../e/equity.md) ratios, [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) levels, and other financial metrics.
3. **Support Mechanisms:** The [parent company](../p/parent_company.md) may promise to infuse [equity](../e/equity.md), provide intercompany loans, or extend lines of [credit](../c/credit.md) as necessary.
4. **[Credit](../c/credit.md) Enhancement:** The primary function is to enhance the [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) of the subsidiary, thereby lowering borrowing costs and facilitating fundraising activities.
5. **[Duration](../d/duration.md):** These agreements can be short-term or long-term depending on the nature of the [debt](../d/debt.md) being issued or the financial arrangement being supported.

## Structure of a Keepwell Agreement

### Parties Involved

- **[Parent Company](../p/parent_company.md):** The financially stronger entity that provides the [assurance](../a/assurance.md).
- **Subsidiary:** The entity receiving the [assurance](../a/assurance.md).
- **Creditors/Investors:** The third parties who benefit from the increased confidence in the subsidiary's [financial health](../f/financial_health.md).

### Clauses Included

1. **Purpose Clause:** Specifies the intention behind the agreement, often highlighting the need to support the subsidiary's financial commitments.
2. **Definition Clause:** Detailed definitions of key terms used within the agreement.
3. **Financial Maintenance Clause:** Specifies the financial covenants and conditions the [parent company](../p/parent_company.md) agrees to maintain for the subsidiary.
4. **Support Undertaking Clause:** Details the type of support (like [equity](../e/equity.md) infusion or loans) the [parent company](../p/parent_company.md) may provide.
5. **[Duration](../d/duration.md) and Termination Clause:** Outlines the lifespan of the agreement and conditions under which it may be terminated.
6. **Governing Law:** Identifies the legal jurisdiction under which the agreement [will](../w/will.md) be interpreted and enforced.
7. **Miscellaneous Provisions:** Other essential clauses such as dispute resolution, amendment procedures, and confidentiality agreements.

## Use Cases and Benefits

### Capital Market Transactions

In [bond](../b/bond.md) issuance or syndicated loans, a Keepwell Agreement can significantly enhance the borrowing costs for subsidiaries. Investors and lenders feel more secure lending [money](../m/money.md) to a subsidiary knowing that the [parent company](../p/parent_company.md) [will](../w/will.md) ensure its financial stability.

### Mergers and Acquisitions

During M&A activities, parent companies may use Keepwell Agreements to support newly acquired entities until they can stand on their own financially. This can help smooth out operational transitions and stabilize the acquired company’s [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md).

### International Operations

Multinational corporations may use Keepwell Agreements to support overseas subsidiaries. This is crucial in jurisdictions where direct guarantees or cross-border loans may be restricted or taxed disadvantageously.

## Legal and Financial Considerations

### Regulatory Perspective

Regulatory bodies may have specific requirements or limitations on the use of Keepwell Agreements. For example, in China, the use of Keepwell Agreements is relatively common among international ventures as part of the financial structuring to align with local regulations.

### Accounting Treatment

The financial commitments under Keepwell Agreements are generally not recognized as liabilities on the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md), considering they are not legally binding guarantees. However, disclosures are necessary in the [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) to inform stakeholders about the potential [obligations](../o/obligation.md).

### Credit Rating Agencies

[Credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) agencies evaluate the credibility and financial strength of the Keepwell provider. They may adjust the subsidiary’s [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) positively if the [parent company](../p/parent_company.md) has a [robust](../r/robust.md) financial profile and a history of fulfilling such commitments.

## Real-world Examples

One notable example is the case of **China Oceanwide [Holdings](../h/holdings.md) Group**, which provided Keepwell Agreements to support its overseas subsidiaries in various financial transactions. The agreements covered [bond](../b/bond.md) issuances that were crucial for funding [expansion](../e/expansion.md) projects and operational activities.

Another instance involves **Greenland Holding Group**, which has used Keepwell Agreements to support its [offshore](../o/offshore.md) [debt](../d/debt.md) issuances, making it an instrumental part of their global financial strategy.

## Criticisms and Controversies

### Moral Hazard

Critics argue that Keepwell Agreements may create [moral hazard](../m/moral_hazard.md) issues where subsidiaries take on excessive risks, relying on the [parent company](../p/parent_company.md)’s support. This can lead to financial mismanagement and potential failures if the [parent company](../p/parent_company.md) is unable to fulfill its commitments.

### Legal Enforceability

Although Keepwell Agreements provide comfort, their non-binding nature means they may not be legally enforceable in some jurisdictions. This can make them less effective in providing the intended financial [security](../s/security.md) compared to guarantees.

### Market Perception

The [market](../m/market.md)'s perception of the [value](../v/value.md) of Keepwell Agreements can vary. While some investors and creditors may view them positively, others may see them as insufficient, especially if the [parent company](../p/parent_company.md)'s [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) is questionable.

## Conclusion

Keepwell Agreements are essential financial instruments that play a significant role in enhancing the [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) of subsidiaries and facilitating more favorable borrowing conditions. They serve as a reassurance tool for creditors and investors, providing a form of financial commitment from a stronger [parent company](../p/parent_company.md). While they are not without criticisms and limitations, their strategic use in [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md), particularly among multinational corporations, underscores their importance in global [business](../b/business.md) operations.

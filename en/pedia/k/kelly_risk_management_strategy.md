# Kelly Risk Management Strategy

The Kelly [Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md) Strategy, commonly referred to simply as the [Kelly Criterion](../k/kelly_criterion.md), is a mathematical formula used to determine the optimal size of a series of bets or investments in [order](../o/order.md) to maximize logarithmic [wealth](../w/wealth.md) over time. It was developed by John L. Kelly Jr., a scientist who worked at AT&T's Bell Labs, and it has since garnered considerable attention and adoption, especially in the realms of [investing](../i/investing.md) and gambling.

## Origin and Background

The [Kelly Criterion](../k/kelly_criterion.md) was originally outlined by John L. Kelly Jr. in his 1956 paper "A New Interpretation of Information Rate." Kelly's work built upon Claude Shannon's Information Theory and sought to maximize the [rate of return](../r/rate_of_return.md) on [capital investment](../c/capital_investment.md) by determining the optimal proportion of [wealth](../w/wealth.md) to allocate in each bet or investment.

## Formula

The [Kelly Criterion](../k/kelly_criterion.md) formula can be expressed as:

\[ f^* = \frac{bp - q}{b} \]

Where:
- \( f^* \) is the fraction of the current bankroll to wager.
- \( b \) is the odds received on the bet (i.e., how much is received for a successful bet).
- \( p \) is the probability of winning.
- \( q \) is the probability of losing, which is \( 1 - p \).

Consider a simple coin toss scenario where the probability of winning (heads) is \( p = 0.5 \) and the [payout](../p/payout.md) of winning is even [money](../m/money.md) (1:1), the Kelly fraction \( f^* \) [will](../w/will.md) be:

\[ f^* = \frac{(1*0.5) - (1-0.5)}{1} = 0 \]

In this case, the [Kelly Criterion](../k/kelly_criterion.md) suggests not betting at all, which is consistent with the [expected value](../e/expected_value.md) being zero.

## Implementation in Trading

In trading and investment, the [Kelly Criterion](../k/kelly_criterion.md) is used to manage portfolio positions and balance [risk](../r/risk.md) versus reward by suggesting a position size that maximizes the logarithm of [wealth](../w/wealth.md) over the long term. Here's a step-by-step procedure typically followed:

1. **Determine the Edge ( \[ E \] )**: The expected [profit](../p/profit.md) from an investment or [trade](../t/trade.md), which is calculated as:
\[ E = (O*P) - (1-P) \]
where \( O \) stands for odds of the [trade](../t/trade.md), \( P \) stands for probability of winning.

2. **Determine the Fraction to Invest ( \[ f \] )**: This is the Kelly fraction, essentially:
\[ f = \frac{E}{O} \]

3. **Adjust for Practical Application**: Since pure Kelly can lead to high [volatility](../v/volatility.md), traders often use a fractional Kelly strategy. For example, using half the Kelly fraction: 
\[ f = 0.5 * \frac{E}{O} \]

### Benefits

- **Maximizes [Capital](../c/capital.md) Growth**: Over the long term, the [Kelly Criterion](../k/kelly_criterion.md) maximizes the growth rate of the [capital](../c/capital.md).
- **Reduces [Risk](../r/risk.md) of Ruin**: By adjusting the bet size according to the probability of success, the formula helps to manage the [risk](../r/risk.md) of substantial losses.

### Criticisms

- **Assumption of Known Probabilities and Payouts**: In real markets, the probabilities of winning and the odds are not usually known with certainty.
- **[Volatility](../v/volatility.md) and [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: Kellyâ€™s full fraction can result in highly volatile [wealth](../w/wealth.md) trajectories. Thus, many traders use fractional Kelly to mitigate this.

## Practical Example

Suppose you have a [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) with a 60% chance of winning ( \( P = 0.6 \) ) and a reward-to-[risk](../r/risk.md) ratio of 2:1. Here's how you would compute the Kelly fraction:

1. **Calculate Edge**:
\[ E = (2*0.6) - 0.4 = 1.2 - 0.4 = 0.8 \]

2. **Calculate Kelly Fraction**:
\[ f = \frac{E}{Odds} = \frac{0.8}{2} = 0.4 \]

Therefore, according to the [Kelly Criterion](../k/kelly_criterion.md), you should allocate 40% of your [capital](../c/capital.md) to this [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md). However, to account for [volatility](../v/volatility.md), you might use half-Kelly, which would recommend a 20% allocation.

## Applications in Financial Markets

### Stock Trading

Traders use the [Kelly Criterion](../k/kelly_criterion.md) to determine [position sizing](../p/position_sizing.md) in stock trading. For instance, if a [trader](../t/trader.md) identifies a stock with a high probability of upward movement based on historical data and other analyses, Kelly can help decide the fraction of the portfolio to invest in that stock.

### Options Trading

In [options](../o/options.md) trading, where [leverage](../l/leverage.md) plays a significant role, the [Kelly Criterion](../k/kelly_criterion.md) offers a structured way to manage the leveraged [risk](../r/risk.md). Traders need to correctly estimate the probabilities and potential payoffs for different strike prices and expiration dates.

### Forex Trading

The [Kelly Criterion](../k/kelly_criterion.md) can be adapted to Forex trading by evaluating the win rates and [payout](../p/payout.md) ratios of [currency](../c/currency.md) pairs. Since Forex traders often engage in high-frequency trading, managing [leverage](../l/leverage.md) and [risk](../r/risk.md) through Kelly ensures sustained [capital](../c/capital.md) growth.

## Conclusion

The Kelly [Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md) Strategy is a powerful mathematical approach for determining optimal bet sizes in trading and investment to maximize long-term growth. Despite its theoretical elegance, practical application demands careful consideration of real-world factors such as estimation errors and [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md). By blending the [Kelly Criterion](../k/kelly_criterion.md) with conservative [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices, traders and investors can [leverage](../l/leverage.md) its strengths while mitigating its potential downsides.

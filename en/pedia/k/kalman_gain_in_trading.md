# Kalman Gain

## Introduction to Kalman Filter
The Kalman Filter is an algorithm that uses a series of measurements observed over time, containing statistical noise and other inaccuracies, and produces estimates of unknown variables that tend to be more accurate than those based on a single measurement alone. The algorithm works in a two-step process: **predict** and **update**.

## Kalman Gain
Kalman Gain, a fundamental part of the Kalman Filter algorithm, helps in adjusting the weights of the predicted and observed values. The Kalman Gain determines how much of the new measurement should be incorporated into the updated estimate. Essentially, it balances the trust between predicted values and measured values. 

The formula for Kalman Gain \( K_t \) is:
\[ K_t = \frac{P_{t|t-1} H_t^T}{H_t P_{t|t-1} H_t^T + R_t} \]
Where:
- \( P_{t|t-1} \) is the predicted estimate covariance.
- \( H_t \) is the measurement matrix.
- \( R_t \) is the measurement noise covariance.

## Application in Trading
In the context of trading, the Kalman Filter and Kalman Gain can be utilized for various purposes including, but not limited to:
- **Predicting Stock Prices**: Using historical price data to predict future movements.
- **Estimating Volatility**: Filtering out the noise to estimate the actual volatility of a stock.
- **[Algorithmic Trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md)**: Implementing the Kalman Filter in conjunction with other [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) for better signal processing and decision making.

### Stock Price Prediction
Traders often use the Kalman Filter to predict future stock prices. By feeding the algorithm with historical price data, traders can produce a smoothed estimate of the stock's direction. The Kalman Gain comes into play by adjusting the weights given to new observed prices versus predicted prices. For instance, during high volatility, the Kalman Gain adjusts to put more weight on new observations.

### Steps to Implement
1. **Initialization**: Define the initial values for the state, covariance matrices, and noise covariances.
2. **Prediction**: Use current state estimates to predict the next state.
3. **Update**: Incorporate new measurements using Kalman Gain to refine predictions.

Hereâ€™s a Python snippet demonstrating the concept:

```python
import numpy as np
```

# Define initial parameters
initial_price = 100
state_estimate = initial_price
estimate_covariance = 1
process_noise = 0.1
measurement_noise = 0.1

# Define prediction and measurement matrices
A = 1  # Transition matrix
H = 1  # Measurement matrix

# Function for Kalman Filter

```python
def kalman_filter(measured_price):
    global state_estimate, estimate_covariance

    # Prediction Step
    state_estimate = A * state_estimate
    estimate_covariance = A * estimate_covariance * A + process_noise

    # Update Step
    kalman_gain = estimate_covariance * H / (H * estimate_covariance * H + measurement_noise)
    state_estimate = state_estimate + kalman_gain * (measured_price - H * state_estimate)
    estimate_covariance = (1 - kalman_gain * H) * estimate_covariance

    return state_estimate
```

# Example usage with a series of measured prices

```python
measured_prices = [102, 101, 104, 107]
filtered_prices = [kalman_filter(p) for p in measured_prices]
print(filtered_prices)
```

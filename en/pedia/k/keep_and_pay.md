# Keep and Pay

## Definition
**Keep and Pay** refers to a legal arrangement often used in [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) proceedings where a debtor is allowed to retain possession of certain secured [collateral](../c/collateral.md) (such as a car or [home](../h/home.md)) as long as they continue to make the required payments on the associated [loan](../l/loan.md) or [debt](../d/debt.md). This arrangement allows the debtor to avoid repossession or [foreclosure](../f/foreclosure.md) while maintaining their financial [obligations](../o/obligation.md).

## Key Components
1. **Secured [Debt](../d/debt.md)**: [Debt](../d/debt.md) that is backed by [collateral](../c/collateral.md), such as a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) or auto [loan](../l/loan.md).
2. **[Bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) Proceedings**: Legal process through which individuals or businesses seek relief from unmanageable [debt](../d/debt.md), typically under Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 of the U.S. [Bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) Code.
3. **Retention of [Collateral](../c/collateral.md)**: The debtor retains possession of the secured property.
4. **Continued Payments**: The debtor must continue making regular payments on the secured [debt](../d/debt.md) to keep the [collateral](../c/collateral.md).

## Importance
1. **[Asset](../a/asset.md) Retention**: Allows debtors to keep essential assets, such as their [home](../h/home.md) or car, which are necessary for daily living and earning a livelihood.
2. **[Debt](../d/debt.md) Management**: Provides a structured way for debtors to manage and pay down secured debts while going through [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md).
3. **Avoiding Repossession**: Helps debtors avoid the negative consequences of repossession or [foreclosure](../f/foreclosure.md), such as losing their [home](../h/home.md) or vehicle and damaging their [credit score](../c/credit_score.md) further.

## Example Scenarios
1. **Chapter 7 [Bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md)**: An individual files for Chapter 7 [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) and chooses to keep their car by continuing to make the monthly payments on the auto [loan](../l/loan.md) under the keep and pay arrangement.
2. **Chapter 13 [Bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md)**: A debtor files for Chapter 13 [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md), which involves creating a [repayment](../r/repayment.md) plan to pay off debts over time. The debtor can include provisions to keep their [home](../h/home.md) and continue making [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) payments.
3. **Reaffirmation Agreement**: In some cases, the debtor might enter into a reaffirmation agreement with the [lender](../l/lender.md), formally agreeing to keep the [asset](../a/asset.md) and continue paying the [debt](../d/debt.md) despite the [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) filing.

## Challenges
1. **Financial Strain**: Continuing to make payments on secured debts can be challenging for debtors who are already in [financial distress](../f/financial_distress.md).
2. **Legal Requirements**: Complying with legal requirements and navigating the complexities of [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) law can be difficult without professional legal assistance.
3. **[Risk](../r/risk.md) of [Default](../d/default.md)**: If the debtor fails to make the required payments, they [risk](../r/risk.md) losing the [asset](../a/asset.md) to repossession or [foreclosure](../f/foreclosure.md).

## Best Practices
1. **Legal Advice**: Seek advice from a [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) attorney to understand the implications of keep and pay arrangements and ensure compliance with legal requirements.
2. **Budgeting**: Create a realistic [budget](../b/budget.md) to ensure that ongoing payments on secured debts can be maintained while managing other financial [obligations](../o/obligation.md).
3. **Timely Payments**: Make all required payments on time to avoid [default](../d/default.md) and the [risk](../r/risk.md) of losing the retained assets.

## Conclusion
The keep and pay arrangement in [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) proceedings allows debtors to retain possession of essential secured assets by continuing to make the required payments on the associated debts. This arrangement provides a way for debtors to manage their financial [obligations](../o/obligation.md) while avoiding the negative consequences of repossession or [foreclosure](../f/foreclosure.md). Understanding the key components, challenges, and [best practices](../b/best_practices.md) associated with keep and pay can help debtors navigate [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) more effectively and maintain their essential assets.

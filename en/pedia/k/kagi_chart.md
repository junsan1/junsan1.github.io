# Kagi Chart

The Kagi Chart is a type of chart that differs from the traditional bar or candlestick charts typically used to illustrate price movements in financial markets. Instead of plotting price against uniform time intervals, a Kagi Chart changes its trajectory only when price movements exceed a specified threshold. This unique characteristic allows the chart to focus on significant price changes and trends, filtering out minor market fluctuations and noise. Developed in Japan, Kagi Charts are widely utilized in technical analysis for making trading decisions and are particularly effective in identifying trends and reversals.

## Features of Kagi Charts

### 1. Price Movement Based
Kagi Charts are driven by price movements rather than time intervals. Consequently, they provide a clearer view of the market's trend by filtering out insignificant price fluctuations.

### 2. Line Thickness
The chart's lines change thickness to signify shifts between 'yang' lines (thicker, upward lines) and 'yin' lines (thinner, downward lines), based on whether the market is bullish or bearish.

### 3. Reversal Criteria
A Kagi Chart reverses direction and changes its line thickness when the price motion surpasses a predefined reversal amount, called the "reversal criterion." This can be an absolute price difference or a percentage of the current price.

### 4. No Fixed Time Axis
Unlike conventional charts, Kagi Charts do not have a fixed time axis. The focus is entirely on significant price movements.

## Interpretation of Kagi Charts

### Yin and Yang Lines
- **Yang (Thick) Lines:** Indicate a strong bullish market.
- **Yin (Thin) Lines:** Indicate a bearish market.

### Kagi Turning Points
- **Reversal Points:** When a yin (downward) line transforms into a yang (upward) line, indicating a buy signal. Conversely, when a yang line transforms into a yin line, it indicates a sell signal.

### Support and Resistance Levels
Kagi Charts naturally incorporate support and resistance levels, making it easier to identify potential entry and exit points for trading.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages
1. **Trend Identification:** Kagi Charts excel in identifying and confirming trend movements.
2. **Noise Reduction:** By focusing only on significant price changes, Kagi Charts filter out the noise inherent in many markets.
3. **Adaptability:** Different reversal criteria can be applied based on the asset class and trading strategy.

### Disadvantages
1. **Complexity:** The lack of uniform time intervals can make Kagi Charts harder to interpret for beginners.
2. **Lag in Signals:** Due to the need for significant price movements to trigger line changes, Kagi Charts may lag in providing timely signals during rapid market fluctuations.
3. **Customization Required:** The effectiveness of Kagi Charts is dependent on the correct setting of the reversal criterion, which may require customization.

## Steps to Create a Kagi Chart

1. **Select an Asset:** Choose the asset for which you want to create the Kagi Chart.
2. **Specify Reversal Criteria:** Set the reversal criterion, which could be a fixed amount (e.g., $1) or a percentage.
3. **Plot Initial Line:** Start plotting from the initial price. 
4. **Monitor Price Movements:** Plot vertical lines representing price movements. Horizontal lines are drawn only when the price changes direction.
5. **Change Line Thickness:** Adjust line thickness when prices cross previous highs (for yang lines) or lows (for yin lines).

## Example Analysis using a Kagi Chart

Imagine analyzing a stock with the following price movements: 

- Start at $100
- Move up to $105
- Drop to $98
- Rise to $110
- Drop to $103

### Step-by-Step Plotting
1. **Initial Line** at $100: Start with a yang line.
2. **Price Moves to $105:** Vertical yang line extends upwards.
3. **Price Drops to $98:** If the reversal criterion (e.g., $3) is met, switch to a yang to yin line.
4. **Price Rises to $110:** As it exceeds the previous $105 high, switch back to a yang line.
5. **Price Falls to $103:** Maintain a yang line if the fall does not meet the reversal criterion.

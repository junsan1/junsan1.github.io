# Kuwait Stock Exchange (KSE)

The Kuwait Stock Exchange, also known as Boursa Kuwait, is the national stock market of Kuwait. It is one of the oldest stock exchanges in the Gulf region, having been established in 1977. Boursa Kuwait plays a vital role in the country's financial system and economy by providing a platform for companies to raise capital and for investors to trade securities. This document explores various aspects of the Kuwait Stock Exchange, including its history, structure, operations, and significance in both the Kuwaiti and global economies, as well as its regulatory environment and trading mechanisms.

## History of the Kuwait Stock Exchange

Kuwait has had a long history of trading and business activity, dating back to the early 20th century. However, the formal establishment of a stock exchange was not realized until 1977. Prior to this, share trading was carried out informally, mainly through an underground share market known as the "Souk Al-Manakh." The collapse of this informal market in the early 1980s, due to speculative trading and lack of regulation, underscored the need for a formal stock exchange governed by stringent regulations.

The government of Kuwait recognized the importance of a regulated market for securities trading and thus established the Kuwait Stock Exchange. Over the years, the KSE has grown and evolved, incorporating modern technologies and methodologies to streamline trading activities and ensure a transparent, efficient, and fair trading environment.

## Structure and Governance

The Kuwait Stock Exchange operates under the regulation of the Capital Markets Authority (CMA) of Kuwait. Boursa Kuwait is managed by a board of directors and has various departments responsible for overseeing different aspects of its operations, including listing, trading, clearing, and settlement. The exchange also collaborates with international regulatory bodies to ensure that its practices meet global standards.

### Listing and Deregulation

To list on the Kuwait Stock Exchange, companies must meet certain criteria, including but not limited to financial performance, operational history, and corporate governance standards.

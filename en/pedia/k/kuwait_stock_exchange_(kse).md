# Kuwait Stock Exchange (KSE)

The Kuwait Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md), also known as Boursa Kuwait, is the national [stock market](../s/stock_market.md) of Kuwait. It is one of the oldest stock exchanges in the Gulf region, having been established in 1977. Boursa Kuwait plays a vital role in the country's [financial system](../f/financial_system.md) and [economy](../e/economy.md) by providing a platform for companies to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) and for investors to [trade](../t/trade.md) securities. This document explores various aspects of the Kuwait Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md), including its history, structure, operations, and significance in both the Kuwaiti and global economies, as well as its regulatory environment and trading mechanisms.

## History of the Kuwait Stock Exchange

Kuwait has had a long history of trading and [business](../b/business.md) activity, dating back to the early 20th century. However, the formal establishment of a stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md) was not realized until 1977. Prior to this, share trading was carried out informally, mainly through an underground share [market](../m/market.md) known as the "Souk Al-Manakh." The collapse of this informal [market](../m/market.md) in the early 1980s, due to speculative trading and lack of regulation, underscored the need for a formal stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md) governed by stringent regulations.

The government of Kuwait recognized the importance of a regulated [market](../m/market.md) for securities trading and thus established the Kuwait Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md). Over the years, the KSE has grown and evolved, incorporating modern technologies and methodologies to streamline trading activities and ensure a transparent, efficient, and fair [trading environment](../t/trading_environment.md).

## Structure and Governance

The Kuwait Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) operates under the regulation of the [Capital Markets](../c/capital_markets.md) Authority (CMA) of Kuwait. Boursa Kuwait is managed by a board of directors and has various departments responsible for overseeing different aspects of its operations, including listing, trading, [clearing](../c/clearing.md), and settlement. The [exchange](../e/exchange.md) also collaborates with international regulatory bodies to ensure that its practices meet global standards.

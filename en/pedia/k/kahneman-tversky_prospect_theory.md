# **Kahneman-Tversky Prospect Theory**

Kahneman-Tversky Prospect Theory, developed by psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, provides a robust framework for understanding decision-making under risk and uncertainty. Published in their seminal 1979 paper "Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision under Risk," the theory challenges the long-standing Expected Utility Theory (EUT) by incorporating psychological insights into economic models.

### Key Elements of Prospect Theory

**1. Value Function:**
Prospect Theory posits that people evaluate potential losses and gains relative to a reference point, often their current position, rather than in absolute terms. The value function is:
- **Concave for gains:** Indicates risk aversion where people prefer certain smaller gains over risky larger gains.
- **Convex for losses:** Signifies risk-seeking behavior where people are more inclined to gamble to avoid a certain loss.
- **Steeper for losses than for gains:** This steepness embodies "[loss aversion](../l/loss_aversion.md)," meaning losses impact individuals more significantly than an equivalent amount of gains. Empirically, losses can be perceived as twice as impactful as gains.

**2. Probability Weighting:**
Prospect Theory also underscores that people do not perceive probabilities linearly. They tend to overweigh small probabilities and underweigh moderate to high probabilities, leading to systematic biases in decision-making under risk:
- **Overweighting of small probabilities:** For example, people might over-invest in low-probability assets like lottery tickets.
- **Underweighting of moderate and high probabilities:** Conversely, they may shy away from high-probability, low-return investments.

### Applications in Algorithmic Trading

Prospect Theory's insights have significant implications for [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). [Trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) premised on classical EUT might not account for investor behavior realistically. Integrating Prospect Theory can enhance predictive models by embedding psychological realism, potentially leading to more robust [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md).

**1. [Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md):**
- Tailor stop-loss mechanisms that account for traders' propensity toward risk-seeking in loss scenarios.
- Design reward strategies that balance risk aversion in gains to optimize trading decisions.

**2. [Behavioral Finance](../b/behavioral_finance.md) Models:**
- Develop models incorporating scenario planning and simulation that reflect non-linear probability weighting to predict market movements more accurately.
- Use historical behavior adjusted through the lens of Prospect Theory to identify predictive behavioral patterns and anomalies.

### Limitations and Criticisms

**1. Empirical Challenges:**
While Prospect Theory is robust in explaining individual decision-making, translating these insights into market-wide prediction models remains empirically challenging due to the collective nature of financial markets where diverse heuristics intersect.

**2. Complexity in Application:**
The multi-factorial nature of Prospect Theory, with its dual-process evaluation (value function and probability weighting), necessitates sophisticated computational models and extensive historical data to parameterize accurately, posing computational and operational challenges.

**3. Evolution of Market Behavior:**
Human behavior is dynamic; stock market participants' heuristics evolve with market and informational contexts, necessitating continual refinements in models based on Prospect Theory to remain effective.

### Implementations in Trading Software

Several trading platforms and financial software companies have begun integrating [behavioral finance](../b/behavioral_finance.md) principles, including Prospect Theory, to enhance their [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md):

**Betterment:**
[https://www.betterment.com](https://www.betterment.com)

Betterment uses [behavioral finance](../b/behavioral_finance.md) principles to construct and manage personalized investment portfolios for clients. By understanding the psychological traits influencing human behavior, Betterment aims to mitigate irrational trading decisions clients might otherwise make instinctively.

**Wealthfront:**

Wealthfront integrates behavioral insights to offer automated investment services that align more closely with how people perceive gains and losses, aiming to improve clients' investment experiences and outcomes.

### Future Perspectives

Prospect Theory's incorporation in [trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md) opens new horizons for research and application:
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML):** Utilize AI and ML to dynamically adapt [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) based on real-time behavioral data, enhancing model accuracy and predictive power.
- **Quantitative [Behavioral Finance](../b/behavioral_finance.md):** Expand [quantitative models](../q/quantitative_models.md) integrating Prospect Theory to simulate market scenarios, thus refining [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) frameworks.
- **Enhanced Personalization:** Tailor investment advice and [portfolio management](../p/portfolio_management.md) services more finely to individual risk profiles, blending quantitative data with behavioral insights for optimal outcomes.

In conclusion, Kahneman-Tversky Prospect Theory offers a transformative lens through which to view decision-making under risk, challenging traditional economic models by embedding psychological realism. While its implementation in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) presents challenges, its potential to enhance predictive accuracy and align [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) with real-world investor behavior marks a significant advancement in [financial modeling](../f/financial_modeling.md) and trading practices.

# Know Sure Thing (KST)

The **Know Sure Thing (KST)** is a momentum oscillator developed by Martin Pring. It's specifically designed for identifying price cycles and potential turning points in a market. This technical analysis tool aims to help traders and investors determine the strength and direction of a security's momentum.

## Overview of KST

KST is based on the smoothed rate-of-change for four different time periods. It is calculated by combining the weighted averages of these different time periods. The formula essentially gives more significance to longer-term momentum, which helps in identifying the major trend.

### How It Works

The KST indicator takes multiple rates of change (ROC) at different time frames and smooths them with moving averages. These smoothed values are then weighted and summed up to generate a single oscillator. This allows it to capture both the short-term and long-term cycles of momentum.

### KST Formula

The KST can be computed using the following steps:

1. **Calculate the Rate of Change (ROC) for multiple time periods**.
   
   - ROC1 = (Current Price / Price N1 periods ago) - 1
   - ROC2 = (Current Price / Price N2 periods ago) - 1
   - ROC3 = (Current Price / Price N3 periods ago) - 1
   - ROC4 = (Current Price / Price N4 periods ago) - 1

2. **Smooth each ROC with a moving average (usually a simple moving average (SMA)).**

   - SMA1 = SMA(ROC1, Period1)
   - SMA2 = SMA(ROC2, Period2)
   - SMA3 = SMA(ROC3, Period3)
   - SMA4 = SMA(ROC4, Period4)

3. **Assign weights to each smoothed ROC.** 

   - Weighted ROC1 = Weight1 * SMA1
   - Weighted ROC2 = Weight2 * SMA2
   - Weighted ROC3 = Weight3 * SMA3
   - Weighted ROC4 = Weight4 * SMA4

4. **Combine the weighted SMAs** to generate the KST value.

   - KST = Weighted ROC1 + Weighted ROC2 + Weighted ROC3 + Weighted ROC4

By summing these weighted and smoothed rates of change, the indicator becomes more robust and less susceptible to market noise.

### Interpretation

Interpreting the KST is similar to other momentum oscillators. It swings above and below a centerline (usually zero), providing insight into the strength and direction of momentum.

- **Above Zero**: Positive momentum, consider long positions.
- **Below Zero**: Negative momentum, consider short positions.
- **Crossovers**: Crosses above zero signify potential buy signals. Crosses below zero indicate potential sell signals.
- **Divergences**: If the price moves higher while KST moves lower (or vice versa), it may signify a potential reversal.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

#### Advantages

- **Multi-timeframe Analysis**: Incorporates multiple rates of change which offers a more comprehensive view of market momentum.
- **Less Noise**: Smoothing and weighting reduce the impact of short-term market fluctuations.
- **Easy to Interpret**: Simple crossovers and divergences make it user-friendly.

#### Disadvantages

- **Lag**: Like many technical indicators, KST can lag price action due to its smoothing components.
- **Complexity**: The calculation involves multiple steps and parameters, making it more complicated than simpler oscillators.

## Real-world Applications

KST can be applied in various scenarios of trading and investing:

1. **Stock Trading**: Particularly useful for long-term stock traders to identify multi-month uptrends or downtrends.
2. **Forex Trading**: Helps in identifying longer-term currency trends without getting caught in short-term noise.
3. **Commodity Trading**: Useful in commodity markets, which can have cyclical price movements.

## Tools and Platforms Supporting KST

Several trading platforms and software tools support the KST indicator. Some of the most notable include:

- **TradingView**: A popular web-based charting tool used by traders globally, supporting a wide array of indicators including KST.
- **MetaTrader 4 and 5 (MT4/MT5)**: Widely used in forex trading, these platforms also support custom indicators like the KST.
- **ThinkorSwim**: Offered by TD Ameritrade, this platform provides advanced charting tools that include the KST.

## Notable Traders Using KST

Though specific traders who exclusively use KST may not have widespread recognition, Martin Pring, its developer, has a well-established reputation in the financial community. His work on market cycles and technical analysis has influenced many traders.

## Practical Example

Imagine you're analyzing the stock of **Apple Inc. (AAPL)**. You've decided to use the 10-day, 15-day, 20-day, and 30-day ROC values. Calculate the SMAs for these ROCs and assign weights as follows:

- Weight1 = 1
- Weight2 = 2
- Weight3 = 3
- Weight4 = 4

You would then sum the weighted SMAs to generate the KST. If the KST crosses above zero, it would be a potential buy signal. Conversely, a cross below zero would indicate a possible sell signal.

# Knowledge Process Outsourcing (KPO)

Knowledge Process [Outsourcing](../o/outsourcing.md) (KPO) is the [outsourcing](../o/outsourcing.md) of core, information-related [business activities](../b/business_activities.md). KPO has become a critical [business](../b/business.md) strategy as modern companies strive to remain competitive and efficient. KPO involves the handling of specialized tasks that require advanced analytical, technical, and decision-making skills. These tasks often include research, analysis, legal work, intellectual property, [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md), and other highly specialized services. 

## Overview of KPO

KPO differs from traditional [Business Process Outsourcing](../b/business_process_outsourcing.md) (BPO) in that it focuses on [outsourcing](../o/outsourcing.md) knowledge-intensive tasks rather than standard [business](../b/business.md) processes. The work outsourced via KPO often involves critical thinking and problem-solving skills that go beyond routine tasks. This allows businesses to harness specialized knowledge and expertise from around the world, often at a lower cost than if the tasks were performed [in-house](../i/in-house.md).

## Key Characteristics of KPO

1. **Specialized Knowledge**:
    KPO focuses on tasks that require specialized knowledge in areas like engineering, medicine, law, [finance](../f/finance.md), and IT.

2. **Expertise**:
    Unlike BPO, which may deal with repetitive tasks, KPO requires employees with advanced degrees, certifications, and extensive experience.

3. **Complex Decision-Making**:
    KPO tasks involve complex decision-making processes, often requiring extensive analysis and interpretation of data.

4. **Higher [Value](../v/value.md) Contribution**:
    KPO tends to add more [value](../v/value.md) to the [business](../b/business.md) than BPO because it directly impacts the company's strategic decisions and [intellectual capital](../i/intellectual_capital.md).

## Sectors Involved in KPO

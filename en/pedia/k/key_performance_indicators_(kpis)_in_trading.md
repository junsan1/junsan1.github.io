# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Key [Performance Indicators](../p/performance_indicators.md) (KPIs) are essential metrics used to evaluate the performance of [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), systems, and financial investments. In the context of trading, KPIs provide an objective measure to track [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md), performance, and profitability, and they help traders make informed decisions. This detailed document outlines various KPIs used in trading, their importance, and how to calculate them.

## 1. Return on Investment (ROI)
[Return](../r/return.md) on Investment (ROI) measures the amount of [return](../r/return.md) on an investment relative to the investment’s cost. It is a straightforward [indicator](../i/indicator.md) used to evaluate the profitability of an investment.

**Formula**: 
  
\[ ROI = \frac{(Current [Value](../v/value.md) of Investment - Cost of Investment)}{Cost of Investment} \times 100 \]

ROI is expressed as a percentage and provides a clear [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of the [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) of an investment.

## 2. Risk-adjusted Return
[Risk-adjusted return](../r/risk-adjusted_return.md) measures the [return](../r/return.md) of an investment relative to the level of [risk](../r/risk.md) taken. Common [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted performance measures include the [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) and the [Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md):

### Sharpe Ratio
The [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) indicates the [average return](../a/average_return.md) earned in excess of the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate per unit of [volatility](../v/volatility.md) or total [risk](../r/risk.md).

**Formula**:

\[ [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) = \frac{(Mean Portfolio [Return](../r/return.md) - [Risk](../r/risk.md)-free Rate)}{[Standard Deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) of Portfolio [Return](../r/return.md)} \]

### Sortino Ratio
The [Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md) adjusts the [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) by differentiating harmful [volatility](../v/volatility.md) from overall [volatility](../v/volatility.md), focusing instead on negative deviation.

**Formula**:

\[ Sortino Ratio = \frac{(Mean Portfolio Return - Risk-free Rate)}{[Downside Deviation](../d/downside_deviation.md)} \]

## 3. Maximum Drawdown
Maximum [Drawdown](../d/drawdown.md) (MDD) is a [risk](../r/risk.md) measure that indicates the largest single drop from peak to [trough](../t/trough.md) in the [value](../v/value.md) of a portfolio, assuming no other withdrawals or [deposit](../d/deposit.md) contributions.

**Formula**:

\[ MDD = \frac{([Trough](../t/trough.md) [Value](../v/value.md) - Peak [Value](../v/value.md))}{Peak [Value](../v/value.md)} \]

A lower MDD indicates better performance with lower [risk](../r/risk.md).

## 4. Win Rate
Win Rate, or Success Rate, measures the percentage of trades that result in a [profit](../p/profit.md). It is applicable for both automated and manual [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

**Formula**:

\[ Win Rate = \frac{Number of Winning Trades}{Total Number of Trades} \times 100 \]

A higher win rate usually signifies a more profitable strategy.

## 5. Profit Factor
[Profit Factor](../p/profit_factor.md) is the ratio of [gross profit](../g/gross_profit.md) to the gross loss expressed in absolute terms. It indicates how many times the strategy returns [profit](../p/profit.md) relative to losses.

**Formula**:

\[ [Profit Factor](../p/profit_factor.md) = \frac{[Gross Profit](../g/gross_profit.md)}{Gross Loss} \]

A [Profit Factor](../p/profit_factor.md) greater than 1 indicates a profitable [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md).

## 6. Average Profit and Loss
Average [Profit](../p/profit.md) and Loss measures the mean [profit](../p/profit.md) and loss per [trade](../t/trade.md) over a period.

**Formula for Average [Profit](../p/profit.md)**:

\[ Average [Profit](../p/profit.md) = \frac{Total [Profit](../p/profit.md)}{Number of Winning Trades} \]

**Formula for Average Loss**:

\[ Average Loss = \frac{Total Loss}{Number of Losing Trades} \]

## 7. Alpha
[Alpha](../a/alpha.md) measures a [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md)’s performance compared to a [market index](../m/market_index.md). Positive [alpha](../a/alpha.md) indicates that a strategy has outperformed the [market](../m/market.md).

**Formula**:

\[ Alpha = Portfolio Return - [Risk-free Rate + Beta \times ([Market](../m/market.md) [Return](../r/return.md) - [Risk](../r/risk.md)-free Rate)] \]

## 8. Beta
[Beta](../b/beta.md) measures the sensitivity of the portfolio returns to the [market](../m/market.md) returns. A [beta](../b/beta.md) greater than 1 indicates higher [volatility](../v/volatility.md) compared to the [market](../m/market.md).

**Formula**:

\[ Beta = \frac{[Covariance](../c/covariance.md)([Return](../r/return.md) of Portfolio, [Return](../r/return.md) of [Market](../m/market.md))}{Variance([Return](../r/return.md) of [Market](../m/market.md))} \]

## 9. Total Equity Curve
Total [Equity](../e/equity.md) Curve plots the cumulative [profit](../p/profit.md) and loss of a [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) over time, providing a visual representation of performance.

## 10. Value at Risk (VaR)
[Value](../v/value.md) at [Risk](../r/risk.md) quantifies the potential loss in [value](../v/value.md) of a portfolio at a given confidence level over a defined period.

**Formula**:

\[ VaR = (Volatility of Portfolio \times Z-Score) \times \sqrt{[Holding Period](../h/holding_period.md)} \]

VaR provides a probable loss threshold and is essential for [risk management](../r/risk_management.md).

## Conclusion
Key [Performance Indicators](../p/performance_indicators.md) in trading are critical tools for evaluating the effectiveness, profitability, and [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). By understanding and regularly monitoring these KPIs, traders can optimize their strategies, manage [risk](../r/risk.md) effectively, and improve their overall performance.

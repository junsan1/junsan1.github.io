# Kelly Betting Strategies

Kelly betting strategies are methodologies used mainly in [investing](../i/investing.md), betting, and trading that stand on the principles of the [Kelly Criterion](../k/kelly_criterion.md). This mathematical formula was introduced by John L. Kelly Jr., a researcher at Bell Labs, in 1956. The [Kelly Criterion](../k/kelly_criterion.md) provides a systematic way to determine the optimal size of a series of bets to maximize the logarithm of [wealth](../w/wealth.md) over the long term.

## Basic Concepts

The [Kelly Criterion](../k/kelly_criterion.md) is grounded in [probability theory](../p/probability_theory_in_trading.md) and information theory. It focuses on maximizing the expected logarithm of [wealth](../w/wealth.md), which is equivalent to maximizing [geometric mean](../g/geometric_mean_in_trading.md) returns. The formula itself is fairly simple but has profound implications for strategy.

### The Kelly Formula

The basic Kelly formula, when dealing with a binary outcome (win or lose), is:

\[ f^* = \frac{bp - q}{b} \]

Where:
- \( f^* \) is the fraction of the current bankroll to wager.
- \( b \) is the net odds received on the wager (i.e., odds are 3 to 1, \( b = 3 \)).
- \( p \) is the probability of winning.
- \( q \) is the probability of losing (which is \( 1 - p \)).

This formula indicates the optimal fraction of one's [money](../m/money.md) to bet.

### Application in Trading

In [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), the [Kelly Criterion](../k/kelly_criterion.md) can be used to determine the portion of the trading [capital](../c/capital.md) to invest in a particular strategy or [asset](../a/asset.md). The goal is to adjust the [trade](../t/trade.md) size based on the expected returns and the win-rate of the [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md). 

#### Example

Imagine a simple scenario in trading where a strategy has:
- 60% win-rate (\( p = 0.60 \))
- [Win/loss ratio](../w/win_loss_ratio.md) (b) of \( 1.5 \)

Using the Kelly Formula:

\[ f^* = \frac{1.5 \times 0.60 - 0.40}{1.5} = \frac{0.90 - 0.40}{1.5} = 0.33 \]

So, 33% of the [capital](../c/capital.md) should be allocated to this strategy for optimal growth of [wealth](../w/wealth.md).

## Advantages of Kelly Betting Strategies

### Long-Term Growth

By focusing on the logarithm of [wealth](../w/wealth.md), the [Kelly Criterion](../k/kelly_criterion.md) ensures long-term growth of [capital](../c/capital.md) and mitigates the [risk](../r/risk.md) of substantial losses leading to [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md). This is crucial in trading where the goal is to sustain and grow the [capital](../c/capital.md) over numerous periods.

### Risk Management

The criterion inherently balances the [risk](../r/risk.md) and reward, providing a systematic [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) strategy. It ensures that bets are not overly aggressive (which could lead to ruin) or overly conservative (which could lead to suboptimal growth).

### Simple and Logical

Despite its roots in complex mathematical theories, the basic Kelly formula is easy to understand and apply. This makes it an attractive tool for traders and investors who seek a structured way to make investment decisions.

## Disadvantages of Kelly Betting Strategies

### Estimation of Probabilities

The [Kelly Criterion](../k/kelly_criterion.md) assumes that the probabilities of winning and losing (and the associated odds) are known and remain constant. In real markets, estimating these values accurately is challenging and dynamic.

### Volatility

Reducing bets to less than the Kelly fraction is often recommended because, while the [Kelly Criterion](../k/kelly_criterion.md) maximizes [wealth](../w/wealth.md), it can also lead to considerable [volatility](../v/volatility.md). Many practitioners use a "Fractional Kelly" approach, where a fraction (e.g., 0.5) of the Kelly fraction is used.

### Complexity in Practice

In more complex trading paradigms, portfolios often contain [multiple](../m/multiple.md) assets with varying correlations and performances. Applying the [Kelly Criterion](../k/kelly_criterion.md) in such contexts can be mathematically intensive and may require sophisticated models and computational power.

## Variations and Modifications

### Fractional Kelly

Most prudent investors and traders adopt a Fractional Kelly approach, using only a fraction (such as half) of the Kelly recommendation to reduce [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and [risk](../r/risk.md). This approach often results in more stable returns.

### Multi-Asset Kelly

In portfolios with [multiple](../m/multiple.md) assets, the [Kelly Criterion](../k/kelly_criterion.md) can be extended to take into account the correlations and variances of the assets. This requires solving more complex [optimization](../o/optimization.md) problems, often leveraging modern portfolio theory.

### Dynamic Kelly

Some advanced strategies involve adjusting the Kelly fraction based on [market](../m/market.md) conditions, sentiment, or other indicators. This dynamic adaptation aims to better align the criterion with the changing probabilities and opportunities in the [market](../m/market.md).

## Real-World Applications

### Hedge Funds

Many [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds and institutional traders utilize some form of Kelly betting strategy to optimize their portfolio growth. Innovations in [computational finance](../c/computational_finance.md) have enabled more accurate estimations and dynamic adjustments in trading portfolios.

### Gambling and Sports Betting

The [Kelly Criterion](../k/kelly_criterion.md) is also famous in the world of professional gambling and sports betting, where it provides a mathematical [basis](../b/basis.md) for stake sizing in bets with known odds and probabilities.

### Financial Advisors and Algorithmic Trading Platforms

Financial advisors and modern [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) platforms sometimes incorporate Kelly-based strategies to guide clients and users in [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) decisions.

## Kelly Criterion in Technology and Software

Several financial technology companies have developed tools and software that help traders apply Kelly betting strategies. For instance:
- **[QuantConnect](../q/quantconnect.md)** (https://www.[quantconnect](../q/quantconnect.md).com/): A platform [offering](../o/offering.md) [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) solutions, including Kelly-based [portfolio optimization](../p/portfolio_optimization.md).
- **AlgorithmicTrading.net** (https://algorithmictrading.net/): Provides traders with [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) strategies that sometimes [leverage](../l/leverage.md) the principles of the [Kelly Criterion](../k/kelly_criterion.md).

## Conclusion

Kelly betting strategies [offer](../o/offer.md) a scientifically grounded method for optimal bet sizing in trading, gambling, and [investing](../i/investing.md). While theoretically attractive, practical application requires careful estimation of probabilities and often benefits from a fractional approach to balance growth and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md). Adoption of Kelly strategies in financial trading platforms and [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds attests to their [robust](../r/robust.md) [utility](../u/utility.md) and the ongoing relevance in the dynamic world of trading and investment.

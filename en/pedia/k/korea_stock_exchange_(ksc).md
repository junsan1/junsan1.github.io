# Korea Stock Exchange (KSE)

The Korea Stock Exchange (KSE) is the central stock exchange in South Korea, providing a platform for the trading of stocks, bonds, and other securities. Established in 1956, KSE plays a pivotal role in the South Korean financial market, serving as a cornerstone for the country's economic development and integration into the global financial system.

## History and Evolution

The KSE has its origins in the formation of the Daehan Stock Exchange Association in 1953. Official trading began in 1956 under this association, primarily dealing in government bonds and a limited array of corporate stocks. Over the decades, the exchange underwent significant transformations, reflecting the economic progress and challenges faced by South Korea.

In 1983, following a series of reforms, the exchange was renamed the Korea Stock Exchange, marking a new era of modernization and expansion. The introduction of electronic trading systems in the 1990s further enhanced the efficiency and capacity of the market. In 2005, KSE merged with the Korea Futures Exchange and KOSDAQ to form the Korea Exchange (KRX), becoming a comprehensive financial marketplace.

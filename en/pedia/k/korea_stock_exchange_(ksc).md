# Korea Stock Exchange (KSE)

The Korea Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (KSE) is the central stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md) in South Korea, providing a platform for the trading of [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, and other securities. Established in 1956, KSE plays a pivotal role in the South Korean financial [market](../m/market.md), serving as a cornerstone for the country's economic development and integration into the global [financial system](../f/financial_system.md).

## History and Evolution

The KSE has its origins in the formation of the Daehan Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) Association in 1953.

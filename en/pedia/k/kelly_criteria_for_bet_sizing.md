# Kelly Criterion for Bet Sizing

The [Kelly Criterion](../k/kelly_criterion.md), also known simply as the Kelly formula, is a mathematical formula used to optimize bet sizing in probability-based ventures, specifically in activities such as gambling, financial trading, and particularly in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). It was derived by John L. Kelly Jr. in 1956 and was initially intended for telecommunications technology applications but was subsequently adopted in financial disciplines. The criterion aims to balance the [trade](../t/trade.md)-off between maximizing returns and controlling the level of [risk](../r/risk.md).

## Mathematical Foundation

The [Kelly Criterion](../k/kelly_criterion.md) can be mathematically expressed as follows:

\[ f^* = \left(\frac{bp - q}{b}\right) \]

Where:
- \( f^* \) represents the fraction of the [capital](../c/capital.md) to bet,
- \( b \) represents the odds received on the bet (net odds, i.e., a 3-to-1 [payout](../p/payout.md) is \( b = 3.0 \)),
- \( p \) is the probability of winning,
- \( q \) is the probability of losing, which is \( q = 1 - p \).

In the context of stock trading, if you're using the [Kelly Criterion](../k/kelly_criterion.md), \( b \) could correspond to the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) from the investment, \( p \) could be the success probability, and \( q \) would be the failure probability.

## Practical Application in Trading

### Algorithmic Trading

Algorithmic traders deploy the [Kelly Criterion](../k/kelly_criterion.md) to determine the ideal position size when executing trades. The Kelly formula helps in maximizing the logarithm of [wealth](../w/wealth.md), which in essence means maximizing the geometric growth rate of the [invested capital](../i/invested_capital.md). Because [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) often involves trading bots and automated decision-making processes, integrating the [Kelly Criterion](../k/kelly_criterion.md) can significantly enhance the performance by calibrating the amount to invest based on statistical probabilities and expected returns.

### Risk Management

[Risk management](../r/risk_management.md) is a critical aspect of trading, and the Kelly formula is an effective tool for managing [risk](../r/risk.md). By utilizing the criterion, traders can avoid overexposure to individual positions, thereby protecting their portfolios against significant drawdowns. Over-betting can lead to high [volatility](../v/volatility.md), while under-betting may slow the growth of [capital](../c/capital.md). The [Kelly Criterion](../k/kelly_criterion.md) balances these concerns by providing a mathematical edge.

## Advantages of Kelly Criterion

### Maximizing Growth

The primary advantage of the [Kelly Criterion](../k/kelly_criterion.md) is that it maximizes the long-term growth rate of [capital](../c/capital.md). Unlike fixed-percentage betting or other [risk](../r/risk.md) strategies, Kelly rationalizes the amount of investment based on historical data and [probability theory](../p/probability_theory_in_trading.md), leading to optimized [capital](../c/capital.md) growth over time.

### Discipline and Objectivity

Applying the [Kelly Criterion](../k/kelly_criterion.md) encourages disciplined and objective trading. As trading decisions are grounded on mathematical expectation, it reduces the possibility of emotional or arbitrary decision-making.

### Reducing Bankruptcy Risk

The criterion, by suggesting fractional betting, inherently protects against total [capital](../c/capital.md) loss. By following the Kelly advice, traders can avoid the pitfall of betting their entire [capital](../c/capital.md) on a single high-[risk](../r/risk.md) venture.

## Disadvantages and Criticisms

### Assumption of Accurate Estimates

The [Kelly Criterion](../k/kelly_criterion.md) heavily relies on the accuracy of the probability estimates and the expected returns. Erroneous inputs can lead to incorrect bet sizing, which could potentially result in substantial losses.

### Volatility

Despite its theoretical promise, the [Kelly Criterion](../k/kelly_criterion.md) can lead to significant [volatility](../v/volatility.md) if followed rigorously. The fraction suggested by Kelly might be too large for some investors to stomach, leading to potential emotional distress and rash decisions.

### Over-optimization

There's a [risk](../r/risk.md) of over-optimizing the bet size based on past data, which might not necessarily predict future outcomes accurately. [Market](../m/market.md) conditions are dynamic, and what's worked in the past might not [hold](../h/hold.md) in the future.

## Fractional Kelly

To mitigate some of the disadvantages, many traders use a fractional Kelly approach. Instead of betting the full Kelly fraction, they use a part, such as half-Kelly or quarter-Kelly. This adjustment softens the [volatility](../v/volatility.md) while still benefiting from the Kelly-based strategy.

\[ f_{\text{fractional}} = c \times \left(\frac{bp - q}{b}\right) \]

Where \( c \) is a constant less than 1 (e.g., for half-Kelly, \( c = 0.5 \)).

## Case Studies and Real-World Application

### Institutional Investors and Hedge Funds

Institutional investors, such as [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds, often use sophisticated versions of the [Kelly Criterion](../k/kelly_criterion.md) to manage their portfolios. Kelly's approach aligns with the multi-period investment philosophies adopted by many of these entities. Renaissance Technologies and its Medallion [Fund](../f/fund.md), managed by Jim Simons, is often noted for using methods akin to the [Kelly Criterion](../k/kelly_criterion.md) in its [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), contributing to its extraordinary returns.

### Poker and Gambling

The [Kelly Criterion](../k/kelly_criterion.md)'s origin in gambling makes it a favorite among professional gamblers, particularly in games like poker where the probabilities can be carefully estimated. Famous gamblers like Bill Benter have reportedly utilized the Kelly strategy with great success in horse racing and betting markets.

## Conclusion

The [Kelly Criterion](../k/kelly_criterion.md) remains one of the cornerstone strategies in both [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) and broader [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) for its [robust](../r/robust.md) mathematical foundation and its ability to provide an optimal [trade](../t/trade.md)-off between growth and [risk](../r/risk.md). Despite its complexities and criticisms, when applied correctly—especially through fractional approaches—it serves as a powerful tool for informed and disciplined financial decision-making.

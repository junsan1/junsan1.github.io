# Kazakhstan National Fund

The Kazakhstan National [Fund](../f/fund.md), established in 2000, is a sovereign [wealth](../w/wealth.md) [fund](../f/fund.md) of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Its primary purpose is to ensure macroeconomic stability and to provide [financing](../f/financing.md) for the country's long-term development projects by managing revenues generated from the country's substantial oil and natural gas reserves. This [fund](../f/fund.md) is of considerable importance as it serves as a financial cushion against fluctuations in global energy markets, which are crucial given Kazakhstan’s significant dependence on [hydrocarbon](../h/hydrocarbon.md) exports.

## Historical Background

Kazakhstan, with its vast resources of oil, gas, and minerals, has leveraged its natural [wealth](../w/wealth.md) to establish the National [Fund](../f/fund.md). The idea was to emulate successful models from other resource-rich countries, like Norway's Government Pension [Fund](../f/fund.md) Global or Alaska's Permanent [Fund](../f/fund.md). By setting aside a portion of its resource revenues, Kazakhstan aims to avoid the "[resource curse](../r/resource_curse.md)" and the boom-bust cycles commonly associated with resource-dependent economies.

The [fund](../f/fund.md) was officially established by presidential decree in August 2000 by Nursultan Nazarbayev, the first President of Kazakhstan. It was initially managed by the [National Bank](../n/national_bank.md) of Kazakhstan, focusing on creating a stable macroeconomic environment, facilitating investments in critical [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md), and fostering economic [diversification](../d/diversification.md).

## Objectives and Goals

The Kazakhstan National [Fund](../f/fund.md) operates under a dual mandate:

1. **Stabilization Function:** To protect the [economy](../e/economy.md) from external shocks by creating a financial buffer. This objective is critical given the [volatility](../v/volatility.md) of oil prices, which can have profound impacts on state revenues and economic stability.

2. **Savings Function:** To accumulate financial reserves for future generations. This ensures that the [wealth](../w/wealth.md) derived from non-[renewable resources](../r/renewable_resource.md) benefits not only the current population but also future generations.

## Fund Structure and Management

### Governance

The governance of the Kazakhstan National [Fund](../f/fund.md) is structured to ensure [transparency](../t/transparency.md), accountability, and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md). The main governing bodies include:

- **The President of Kazakhstan:** Provides strategic direction and oversight.
- **The Government of Kazakhstan:** Responsible for the operational aspects and implementation of policies.
- **The [National Bank](../n/national_bank.md) of Kazakhstan:** Acts as the fiduciary manager, responsible for the day-to-day investment and management of the [fund](../f/fund.md)’s assets.

### Investment Strategy

The [fund](../f/fund.md)’s assets are allocated across a diversified portfolio designed to balance [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md). The [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) traditionally focuses on the following:

- **Government Securities:** High-quality, low-[risk](../r/risk.md) bonds, primarily from developed countries, to ensure stable returns.
- **Equities:** A portion of the [fund](../f/fund.md) is invested in global [equity](../e/equity.md) markets to take advantage of higher potential returns.
- **[Real Estate](../r/real_estate.md) and [Infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) Projects:** Investments in this category aim at fostering domestic development aligned with the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s long-term objectives.

### Withdrawal and Allocation Rules

To maintain the integrity and sustainability of the [fund](../f/fund.md), strict rules are in place regarding withdrawals:

- **Annual Transfers:** Each fiscal year, a predetermined transfer amount is allocated to the state [budget](../b/budget.md) to support government expenditures, particularly in times of [revenue](../r/revenue.md) shortfalls.
- **Emergency Withdrawals:** In exceptional circumstances, such as severe economic crises, additional withdrawals can be sanctioned.

## Performance and Impact

### Financial Performance

Since its inception, the Kazakhstan National [Fund](../f/fund.md) has grown substantially. It has effectively insulated the national [economy](../e/economy.md) from global financial turmoil, particularly during the 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) and the more recent fluctuations in global oil prices. Periodic reports and audits are conducted to ensure [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and measure performance against benchmarks.

- **Growth:** Reports from the [National Bank](../n/national_bank.md) of Kazakhstan indicate steady growth in the [fund](../f/fund.md)’s assets, reaching over $70 billion at its peak.
- **Returns:** The [fund](../f/fund.md) has consistently achieved positive returns, though these have been subject to [market](../m/market.md) conditions and global economic trends.

### Economic and Social Impact

The [fund](../f/fund.md) has played a critical role in stabilizing Kazakhstan’s [economy](../e/economy.md), particularly during periods of low oil prices. By providing a steady source of budgetary support, it has facilitated:

- **[Infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) Development:** [Financing](../f/financing.md) major projects like roads, schools, and hospitals, which are crucial for long-term development.
- **Economic [Diversification](../d/diversification.md):** Supporting initiatives aimed at reducing the [economy](../e/economy.md)’s reliance on hydrocarbons by fostering other sectors such as agriculture, [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md), and tourism.
- **Social [Welfare](../w/welfare.md) Programs:** Funding various social initiatives, including healthcare and education, to improve the [quality of life](../q/quality_of_life.md) for Kazakh citizens.

## Challenges and Criticisms

Despite its successes, the Kazakhstan National [Fund](../f/fund.md) has faced several challenges and criticisms:

- **Governance and [Transparency](../t/transparency.md):** Concerns have been raised about the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and the potential for mismanagement or misuse of funds. Efforts have been made to improve governance practices, but continuous monitoring and reform are necessary.
- **Economic Dependency:** While the [fund](../f/fund.md) helps mitigate risks associated with oil dependence, critics argue that more aggressive measures are needed to diversify the [economy](../e/economy.md) and reduce the country’s vulnerability to oil [price shocks](../p/price_shocks.md).
- **Ethical Considerations:** Investments in certain securities or industries have raised ethical questions, prompting calls for the [fund](../f/fund.md) to adopt more socially responsible investment practices.

## Future Outlook

The future of the Kazakhstan National [Fund](../f/fund.md) looks promising, given ongoing reforms and efforts to enhance its management. Key areas of focus include:

- **Enhancing [Transparency](../t/transparency.md):** Continued efforts to improve [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and governance to build public [trust](../t/trust.md) and ensure efficient use of resources.
- **Diversifying Investments:** Expanding the [fund](../f/fund.md)’s investment horizons to include more sustainable and socially responsible assets.
- **Economic Reform:** Supporting broader economic reforms aimed at diversifying Kazakhstan’s [economy](../e/economy.md) and reducing dependence on natural resources.

The Kazakhstan National [Fund](../f/fund.md) remains a critical tool for managing the country’s resource [wealth](../w/wealth.md) and ensuring long-term economic stability and prosperity for future generations.

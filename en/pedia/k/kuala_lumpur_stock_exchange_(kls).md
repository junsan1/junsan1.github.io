# Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLS)

The Kuala Lumpur Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (KLSE), now known as Bursa Malaysia, is the primary stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md) in Malaysia. Located in the country's [capital](../c/capital.md), Kuala Lumpur, it plays a vital role in the Malaysian financial [market](../m/market.md), facilitating the trading of various financial instruments including equities, [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), and bonds. Established to promote a transparent, efficient, and [orderly market](../o/orderly_market.md) for trading securities, Bursa Malaysia has grown into a significant hub for financial activities in Southeast Asia.

## History and Evolution

The Kuala Lumpur Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) was established in 1930 under the name Singapore Stockbrokers’ Association. Initially, it was an informal [exchange](../e/exchange.md) trading in [stocks](../s/stock.md) and [shares](../s/shares.md). The association evolved into the Malayan Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) in 1960 and then into the Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) of Malaysia in 1964. Following Malaysia’s separation from Singapore, the Kuala Lumpur Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) was formed in 1973 and commenced operations in 1976. In 2004, it was renamed Bursa Malaysia to reflect a more integrated and comprehensive marketplace.

## Structure and Organization

1. **Main [Market](../m/market.md)**: The Main [Market](../m/market.md) is where large-cap companies list their [shares](../s/shares.md). It includes a wide [range](../r/range.md) of industries such as banking, technology, and [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md).
  
2. **ACE [Market](../m/market.md)**: This [market](../m/market.md) is designed for growth companies, allowing them to raise funds to support expansions and innovations. The ACE [Market](../m/market.md) generally caters to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

# Key Market Indicators

## Introduction

In the realm of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), understanding and utilizing key [market indicators](../m/market_indicators.md) is crucial for developing effective [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). Key [market indicators](../m/market_indicators.md) encompass a [range](../r/range.md) of metrics and data points that can provide insights into [market](../m/market.md) trends, trading volumes, price movements, and overall [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md). This comprehensive guide delves into the most pivotal [market indicators](../m/market_indicators.md) used in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), their significance, and how they can be applied to create [robust](../r/robust.md) [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md).

## 1. Moving Averages (MA)

Moving Averages (MA) smooth out price data by creating a constantly updated average price. They are fundamental in identifying the direction of the [trend](../t/trend.md). Most commonly used MAs include:

- **Simple Moving Average (SMA)**: The average price over a specified number of periods.
- **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**: Places more emphasis on recent prices, making it more responsive to new information.

### Application in Algorithmic Trading
In [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), MAs help in identifying trends and potential [reversal](../r/reversal.md) points. They are often used in crossover strategies where signals are generated based on the crossing of shorter-term and longer-term moving averages.

### Example
```python
# Python Example of Calculating SMA
def simple_moving_average(prices, window):
    [return](../r/return.md) sum(prices[-window:]) / window

prices = [150, 152, 153, 151, 152, 155, 158]
window_size = 3
sma = simple_moving_average(prices, window_size)
print(sma)  # Output: 155.0
```

## 2. Relative Strength Index (RSI)

The [Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index.md) (RSI) is a [momentum](../m/momentum.md) [oscillator](../o/oscillator.md) that measures the speed and change of price movements. It ranges from 0 to 100 and is typically used to identify [overbought](../o/overbought.md) or [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions.

- **[Overbought](../o/overbought.md)**: RSI above 70
- **[Oversold](../o/oversold.md)**: RSI below 30

### Application in Algorithmic Trading
RSI can be used to generate signals based on [divergence](../d/divergence.md), [overbought](../o/overbought.md)/[oversold](../o/oversold.md) levels, and changes in [momentum](../m/momentum.md). Algorithms often incorporate RSI to manage entry and exit points effectively.

### Example
```python
# Python Example of RSI Calculation
[import](../i/import.md) pandas as pd

def calculate_rsi(prices, n=14):
    deltas = pd.Series(prices).diff()
    [gain](../g/gain.md) = deltas.clip(lower=0).mean()
    loss = -deltas.clip(upper=0).mean()
    rs = [gain](../g/gain.md) / loss
    [return](../r/return.md) 100 - (100 / (1 + rs))

prices = [44, 45, 44, 46, 45, 47, 48, 49, 50, 47, 46]
rsi = calculate_rsi(prices)
print(rsi)  # RSI [value](../v/value.md) output
```

## 3. Bollinger Bands

[Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md) consist of a middle band (SMA) and two outer bands that are set 2 standard deviations away from the middle band. They are used to measure [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and identify [overbought](../o/overbought.md)/[oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions.

### Application in Algorithmic Trading
[Trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) use [Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md) to gauge [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and [price action](../p/price_action.md). Strategies often involve buying when prices touch the lower band and selling when they reach the upper band.

### Example
```python
# Python Example Calculating Bollinger Bands
[import](../i/import.md) pandas as pd

def bollinger_bands(prices, window=20, num_of_std=2):
    sma = pd.Series(prices).rolling(window=window).mean()
    rstd = pd.Series(prices).rolling(window=window).std()
    upper_band = sma + num_of_std * rstd
    lower_band = sma - num_of_std * rstd
    [return](../r/return.md) sma, upper_band, lower_band

prices = [150, 152, 153, 151, 152, 155, 158, 160, 162, 165, 167, 170]
middle_band, upper_band, lower_band = bollinger_bands(prices)
print(middle_band, upper_band, lower_band)  # Bands output
```

## 4. Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)

The MACD is a [trend](../t/trend.md)-following [momentum](../m/momentum.md) [indicator](../i/indicator.md) that shows the relationship between two moving averages of prices. It comprises the MACD line, the signal line, and the [histogram](../h/histogram.md).
  
- **MACD Line**: Difference between the 12-day EMA and the 26-day EMA
- **Signal Line**: 9-day EMA of the MACD Line
- **[Histogram](../h/histogram.md)**: Difference between the MACD Line and the Signal Line

### Application in Algorithmic Trading
MACD is used to identify crossovers, divergences, and changes in [market](../m/market.md) [momentum](../m/momentum.md). [Trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) use it to form strategies around these signals.

### Example
```python
# Python Example Calculating MACD
[import](../i/import.md) pandas as pd

def calculate_macd(prices, n_fast=12, n_slow=26, n_signal=9):
    ema_fast = pd.Series(prices).ewm(span=n_fast, min_periods=n_slow).mean()
    ema_slow = pd.Series(prices).ewm(span=n_slow, min_periods=n_slow).mean()
    macd = ema_fast - ema_slow
    signal = macd.ewm(span=n_signal, min_periods=n_signal).mean()
    [histogram](../h/histogram.md) = macd - signal
    [return](../r/return.md) macd, signal, [histogram](../h/histogram.md)

prices = [44, 45, 44, 46, 45, 47, 48, 49, 50, 47, 46]
macd, signal, [histogram](../h/histogram.md) = calculate_macd(prices)
print(macd, signal, [histogram](../h/histogram.md))  # MACD output
```

## 5. Stochastic Oscillator

The [Stochastic Oscillator](../s/stochastic_oscillator.md) compares a particular closing price of a [security](../s/security.md) to its price [range](../r/range.md) over a specified period. 

- **%K Line**: The main line
- **%D Line**: 3-day SMA of %K line

### Application in Algorithmic Trading
Used to generate [overbought](../o/overbought.md) and [oversold](../o/oversold.md) signals, and it works best in broad trading ranges or slow trading markets. Algorithms use [stochastic oscillator](../s/stochastic_oscillator.md) to capture [market](../m/market.md) [momentum](../m/momentum.md).

### Example
```python
# Python Example Calculating Stochastic Oscillator
[import](../i/import.md) pandas as pd

def stochastic_oscillator(df, k_window=14, d_window=3):
    min_low = df['Low'].rolling(window=k_window).min()
    max_high = df['High'].rolling(window=k_window).max()
    df['%K'] = (df['Close'] - min_low) * 100 / (max_high - min_low)
    df['%D'] = df['%K'].rolling(window=d_window).mean()
    [return](../r/return.md) df[['%K', '%D']]

data = {
    'Low': [20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 35, 30, 30, 25, 30],
    'High': [50, 55, 53, 54, 55, 65, 60, 65, 61, 62],
    'Close': [45, 46, 47, 45, 48, 50, 58, 53, 48, 55]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
stochastic = stochastic_oscillator(df)
print(stochastic)  # [Stochastic Oscillator](../s/stochastic_oscillator.md) output
```

## 6. Volume Indicators

[Volume indicators](../v/volume_indicators.md) analyze the [volume](../v/volume.md) of traded [security](../s/security.md) to understand the strength of a price move. Common [volume indicators](../v/volume_indicators.md) include:

- **On-Balance [Volume](../v/volume.md) (OBV)**: Measures buying and selling pressure as a cumulative [indicator](../i/indicator.md).
- **[Volume](../v/volume.md) Price [Trend](../t/trend.md) (VPT)**: Combines price and [volume](../v/volume.md) to determine the direction of a [trend](../t/trend.md).

### Application in Algorithmic Trading
[Volume indicators](../v/volume_indicators.md) are crucial in confirming price trends and potential reversals. Algorithms might use [volume](../v/volume.md) data to filter signals and provide more context to price movements.

### Example
```python
# Python Example Calculating OBV
[import](../i/import.md) pandas as pd

def on_balance_volume(df):
    obv = [0]
    for i in [range](../r/range.md)(1, len(df['Close'])):
        if df['Close'][i] > df['Close'][i - 1]:
            obv.append(obv[-1] + df['[Volume](../v/volume.md)'][i])
        elif df['Close'][i] < df['Close'][i - 1]:
            obv.append(obv[-1] - df['[Volume](../v/volume.md)'][i])
        else:
            obv.append(obv[-1])
    df['OBV'] = obv
    [return](../r/return.md) df

data = {
    'Close': [44, 45, 44, 46, 45, 47, 48, 49, 50, 47, 46],
    '[Volume](../v/volume.md)': [100, 150, 120, 160, 130, 170, 110, 130, 140, 150, 160]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
obv_df = on_balance_volume(df)
print(obv_df[['Close', 'OBV']])  # OBV output
```

## 7. Fibonacci Retracement

[Fibonacci retracement](../f/fibonacci_retracement.md) levels are horizontal lines that indicate where [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) are likely to occur. They are based on the Fibonacci sequence and are used to predict the extent of a [market](../m/market.md) movement.

- **Key Levels**: 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 100%

### Application in Algorithmic Trading
[Fibonacci retracement](../f/fibonacci_retracement.md) levels are used to identify potential [reversal](../r/reversal.md) points. Algorithms might incorporate these levels to trigger buy or sell actions based on [market](../m/market.md) corrections.

### Example
```python
# Python Example Calculating Fibonacci Retracement
def fibonacci_retracement(prices):
    max_price = max(prices)
    min_price = min(prices)
    diff = max_price - min_price

    levels = {
        '23.6%': max_price - diff * 0.236,
        '38.2%': max_price - diff * 0.382,
        '50.0%': max_price - diff * 0.5,
        '61.8%': max_price - diff * 0.618,
        '100%': min_price
    }
    [return](../r/return.md) levels

prices = [150, 180, 200, 220, 190, 160, 170, 210, 240, 200]
fib_levels = fibonacci_retracement(prices)
print(fib_levels)  # [Fibonacci Retracement](../f/fibonacci_retracement.md) Levels output
```

## 8. Average True Range (ATR)

ATR measures [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) by decomposing the entire [range](../r/range.md) of an [asset](../a/asset.md) price for that period. Developed by J. Welles Wilder, it does not provide an indication of price direction but gauges [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

### Application in Algorithmic Trading
Algorithms use ATR to set stop-loss levels and to understand [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md), ensuring that trades are placed at optimal times.

### Example
```python
# Python Example Calculating ATR
[import](../i/import.md) pandas as pd

def calculate_atr(df, window=14):
    df['H-L'] = df['High'] - df['Low']
    df['H-PC'] = abs(df['High'] - df['Close'].shift(1))
    df['L-PC'] = abs(df['Low'] - df['Close'].shift(1))
    df['TR'] = df[['H-L', 'H-PC', 'L-PC']].max(axis=1)
    df['ATR'] = df['TR'].rolling(window=window).mean()
    [return](../r/return.md) df

data = {
    'High': [50, 55, 53, 54, 55, 65, 60, 65, 61, 62],
    'Low': [44, 45, 44, 46, 45, 50, 55, 55, 58, 57],
    'Close': [45, 46, 47, 45, 48, 50, 58, 53, 48, 55]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
atr_df = calculate_atr(df)
print(atr_df[['TR', 'ATR']])  # ATR output
```

# Kenney Rule

The Kenney Rule is a relatively lesser-known trading rule in the realm of [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), or "algotrading." It is named after a prominent figure in the trading [industry](../i/industry.md), although detailed historical documentation on the origin of the rule might be sparse. The Kenney Rule is particularly impactful in the domain of [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) and [portfolio optimization](../p/portfolio_optimization.md), [offering](../o/offering.md) traders a framework to protect [capital](../c/capital.md) while maximizing the potential for profitable trades.

## Background and Importance in Algotrading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), or algotrading, involves the use of automated systems to execute orders in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). These systems rely on pre-set rules and [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md) to make trading decisions at very high speeds, often much faster than human traders. Given the speed and complexity of these trades, a [robust](../r/robust.md) [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) strategy is crucial to avoid significant losses. The Kenney Rule serves as one such strategy, helping traders maintain a balanced portfolio and manage [risk](../r/risk.md) effectively.

## Principle Behind Kenney Rule

At its core, the Kenney Rule advises traders to divide their [capital](../c/capital.md) into distinct units and never [risk](../r/risk.md) more than a predetermined percentage of their total [capital](../c/capital.md) on a single [trade](../t/trade.md). This principle is congruent with the broader concept of "[position sizing](../p/position_sizing.md)" in trading, which involves determining the correct amount of [capital](../c/capital.md) to allocate to a single position to manage [risk](../r/risk.md) effectively.

### Main Tenets of the Kenney Rule

1. **[Capital Allocation](../c/capital_allocation.md)**: Divide your total trading [capital](../c/capital.md) into a number of smaller units. Each unit represents a fraction of your total [capital](../c/capital.md).
2. **[Risk Control](../r/risk_control.md)**: Limit the amount of [capital](../c/capital.md) placed in any single [trade](../t/trade.md) to a fixed percentage of your total trading [capital](../c/capital.md).
3. **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: Spread out investments across various assets to minimize the impact of any single [trade](../t/trade.md) going wrong.

## Mathematical Framework

To implement the Kenney Rule, one can follow a series of mathematical steps:

1. **Define Total [Capital](../c/capital.md) (TC)**: Let's say your total trading [capital](../c/capital.md) is $100,000.
2. **Determine [Risk](../r/risk.md) Percentage (RP)**: Choose a [risk](../r/risk.md) percentage you are comfortable with, say 1%.
3. **Calculate [Risk](../r/risk.md) Per [Trade](../t/trade.md) (RPT)**: `RPT = TC * RP`. For a $100,000 [capital](../c/capital.md) with a 1% [risk](../r/risk.md), this would be $1,000.
4. **[Position Sizing](../p/position_sizing.md)**: Determine the size of each [trade](../t/trade.md) based on the amount you can afford to lose without exceeding the [risk](../r/risk.md) limit.

Assuming you're trading [stocks](../s/stock.md), if you plan to buy [shares](../s/shares.md) of a company trading at $50 per share and decide that your stop loss is $45, then the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) you can buy would be:

\[ \text{Number of [Shares](../s/shares.md)} = \frac{\text{RPT}}{\text{Entry Price - Stop Loss}} \]

In this case:

\[ \text{Number of [Shares](../s/shares.md)} = \frac{1000}{50 - 45} = 200 \]

Thus, you would buy 200 [shares](../s/shares.md) of the stock.

## Advantages of the Kenney Rule

1. **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Mitigation**: One of the main advantages of the Kenney Rule is its ability to control the [risk](../r/risk.md) on any single [trade](../t/trade.md), preventing catastrophic losses.
2. **Emotional Control**: By adhering to predefined [risk](../r/risk.md) parameters, traders can make more rational decisions and avoid emotionally-driven trades.
3. **Consistent Performance**: The rule fosters a disciplined approach to trading, which can lead to more consistent performance over time.

## Criticisms and Limitations

While the Kenney Rule offers strong advantages, it is not without its criticisms and limitations:

1. **Over-Simplification**: Critics argue that the rule might be too simplistic, especially in volatile markets where price swings can be extreme.
2. **Rigidity**: Some traders find the rule too rigid, limiting their ability to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on high-conviction trades.
3. **Not Foolproof**: As with any trading rule, it cannot eliminate [risk](../r/risk.md) entirely, particularly the [risk](../r/risk.md) of [market](../m/market.md) [gaps](../g/gap.md) where the price jumps over the stop loss level.

## Implementation in Algotrading

To implement the Kenney Rule in an [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) system, you need a series of code snippets and algorithms that enforce the rule. This could be done in various programming languages commonly used in algotrading, such as Python or R. Below is a simple example in Python, using basic constructs to demonstrate the principle.

### Example Code in Python

```python
[import](../i/import.md) numpy as np

# Define initial variables
total_capital = 100000  # Total trading [capital](../c/capital.md)
risk_percentage = 0.01  # [Risk](../r/risk.md) 1% of [capital](../c/capital.md) per [trade](../t/trade.md)

# Calculate Risk Per Trade (RPT)
risk_per_trade = total_capital * risk_percentage

# Function to calculate position size based on entry and stop loss prices
def calculate_position_size(entry_price, stop_loss_price):
    risk_per_share = entry_price - stop_loss_price
    [return](../r/return.md) risk_per_trade / risk_per_share

# Example usage
entry_price = 50
stop_loss_price = 45
position_size = calculate_position_size(entry_price, stop_loss_price)

print(f"Position Size: {position_size} [shares](../s/shares.md)")
```

This code calculates the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) to buy based on the Kenney Rule principles. Traders can integrate such functions into larger algotrading systems to automate the process of calculating position sizes based on predefined [risk](../r/risk.md) parameters.

## Case Study: Application in a Trading Firm

Let's explore a hypothetical case study of a trading [firm](../f/firm.md), "AlgoTrade Solutions," applying the Kenney Rule within their [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md).

### Initial Setup

- **Total [Capital](../c/capital.md)**: $10,000,000
- **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Percentage**: 0.5% (each [trade](../t/trade.md) represents a [risk](../r/risk.md) of $50,000)
- **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: Trades across [stocks](../s/stock.md), forex, and commodities.

### Execution

1. **Stock Trades**: Suppose the [firm](../f/firm.md) decides to buy [shares](../s/shares.md) of a tech company trading at $100 per share, with a stop loss at $95.
2. **Forex Trades**: In a forex pair trading at 1.2000 with a stop loss at 1.1950.
3. **[Commodity](../c/commodity.md) Trades**: A [commodity](../c/commodity.md) trading at $1500 per unit with a stop loss at $1490.

### Calculations

- **Stock Position Size**: \[ \frac{50000}{100 - 95} = 1000 \text{ [shares](../s/shares.md)} \]
- **Forex Position Size**: \[ \frac{50000}{1.2000 - 1.1950} = 10,000 \text{ units} \]
- **[Commodity](../c/commodity.md) Position Size**: \[ \frac{50000}{1500 - 1490} = 5 \text{ units} \]

By following the Kenney Rule, AlgoTrade Solutions effectively allocates its [capital](../c/capital.md) across [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [asset](../a/asset.md) classes while adhering to [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) principles, thereby safeguarding its [capital](../c/capital.md).

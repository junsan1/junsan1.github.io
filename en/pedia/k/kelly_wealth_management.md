Algo (algorithmic) trading refers to the utilization of algorithms to make trading decisions, execute orders, and manage portfolios.

Here's how Kelly [Wealth Management](../w/wealth_management.md) implements algo trading in its operations:

1. **Algorithm Development and Testing**: At the heart of Kelly [Wealth Management](../w/wealth_management.md)'s strategy is the creation and refinement of [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md). These algorithms are designed to identify trading opportunities based on predefined criteria and historical data patterns. [Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) these algorithms on historical market data is critical to ensure their effectiveness and robustness before deployment in live trading scenarios.

Kelly [Wealth Management](../w/wealth_management.md) employs sophisticated execution strategies to minimize market impact and slippage, ensuring that trades are carried out at optimal prices.

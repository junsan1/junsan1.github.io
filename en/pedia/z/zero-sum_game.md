# Zero-Sum Game

A zero-sum game is a concept widely studied in the field of [game theory](../g/game_theory.md) and [economics](../e/economics.md). It refers to situations where the [gain](../g/gain.md) of one participant is exactly balanced by the loss of another participant, making the [net change](../n/net_change.md) in [wealth](../w/wealth.md) or benefit zero. In essence, in a zero-sum game, the total amount of resources available to all participants remains constant, with only the [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of these resources changing. This term is crucial in understanding various competitive scenarios, including those in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), negotiations, sports, and even some aspects of social behavior.

### Characteristics of Zero-Sum Games

1. **Fixed Resources**: The total amount of resources remains constant. The sum of gains and losses among all participants is always zero.
2. **Direct Competition**: The interests of participants are directly opposed. One participant's [gain](../g/gain.md) is another's loss.
3. **Strategic Interdependence**: Participants must consider the strategies and potential decisions of others in [order](../o/order.md) to maximize their own [payout](../p/payout.md).

### Game Theory and Zero-Sum Games

[Game theory](../g/game_theory.md) provides the mathematical framework to analyze decisions in zero-sum games. John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern formalized [game theory](../g/game_theory.md) and introduced the concept of zero-sum games in their pivotal 1944 book, "Theory of Games and Economic Behavior."

Zero-sum games are represented in several forms, including:

- **Matrix Form**: A table where payoffs to players are [listed](../l/listed.md) for every combination of strategies.
- **Extensive Form**: A game tree that shows how the game unfolds over time with the sequential choices of players.

### Types of Zero-Sum Games

Zero-sum games can be classified into various categories based on certain characteristics:

- **Finite vs. Infinite**: Finite zero-sum games have a fixed number of moves or strategies, while infinite games have unlimited possibilities.
- **Simultaneous vs. Sequential**: In simultaneous games, players make decisions at the same time without knowing the others' choices. In sequential games, players make decisions one after another, with each aware of the previous choices.

### Examples of Zero-Sum Games

1. **Poker**: A classic example of a zero-sum game. The winnings of one player equal the losses of the other players.
2. **Chess**: Often considered a zero-sum game if we disregard draws. The win of one player is the loss of the other.
3. **Trading**: Some aspects of trading, especially [options](../o/options.md) and [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md), can be considered zero-sum, where the [gain](../g/gain.md) of one [trader](../t/trader.md) (or group) is the loss of another.

### Zero-Sum Game in Financial Markets

In [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), the concept of zero-sum games is applied in various trading activities. 

- **[Futures](../f/futures.md) and [Options](../o/options.md)**: These [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) markets are often cited as examples of zero-sum games. For every [profit](../p/profit.md) made by a buyer of a [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md), the seller incurs an equivalent loss, and vice versa.
- **[Algorithmic Trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md)**: In high-frequency trading, algorithms compete for the best [execution](../e/execution.md) prices. The [gain](../g/gain.md) from getting a favorable price is precisely the loss endured by the [counterparty](../c/counterparty.md).
  
### Companies and Zero-Sum Game Concept

Several companies specialize in trading and have platforms and tools that operate under the principles of zero-sum games:

1. **[Interactive Brokers](../i/interactive_brokers.md)**: Offers a wide array of trading tools that are used in [futures](../f/futures.md) and [options](../o/options.md) markets (https://www.interactivebrokers.com)
2. **CME Group**: The world's largest [futures](../f/futures.md) and [options](../o/options.md) [exchange](../e/exchange.md), where many [zero-sum trading](../z/zero-sum_trading.md) activities take place (https://www.cmegroup.com)

### Criticisms and Limitations

Although the zero-sum game framework is useful, it has its limitations:

- **Not Always Realistic**: Many real-world scenarios involve growing or shrinking pies rather than fixed sums. For example, in free-[market](../m/market.md) economies, [wealth](../w/wealth.md) can be created (positive-sum games).
- **Cooperation Overlooked**: Zero-sum analyses often neglect the potential for cooperative strategies that can enhance overall [welfare](../w/welfare.md).
- **Zero-Sum Bias**: People often perceive situations as zero-sum even when they are not, leading to suboptimal decision-making and conflict.

### Conclusion

The zero-sum game is an essential concept in [game theory](../g/game_theory.md) and is instrumental in understanding competitive interactions where the total benefit is fixed. It helps elucidate the nature of strategic decision-making and resource allocation in various fields, particularly in trading and [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). While the zero-sum approach is potent in specific contexts, recognizing its limitations is vital for a comprehensive analysis of economic and social phenomena.

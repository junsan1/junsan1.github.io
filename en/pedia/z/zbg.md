1. **Spot Trading**: This is the basic form of trading where users buy and sell cryptocurrencies at current market prices. ZBG offers multiple trading pairs, enabling users to diversify their portfolios.

### Security Measures

To ensure the safety of users’ funds and data, ZBG implements a variety of security measures:

1. **Cold Storage**: The vast majority of user funds are stored in cold wallets, which are offline and thus less vulnerable to hacking.

3. **KYC/AML Compliance**: ZBG adheres to Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations, requiring users to complete identity verification processes.

### Example Algorithms

#### Market Making

Market making algorithms can benefit from ZBG's low maker fees and high liquidity. A basic market-making strategy would involve placing both buy and sell limit orders around the current market price to capture the bid-ask spread.

```python
import zbg_api
import time

api = zbg_api.ZbgAPI(api_key, api_secret)

def market_maker(symbol):
    while True:
        try:
            order_book = api.get_order_book(symbol)
            best_bid = order_book['bids'][0][0]
            best_ask = order_book['asks'][0][0]

            # Place buy and sell orders around the current price
            buy_order = api.place_order(symbol, 'buy', best_bid - 0.01, 0.1)
            sell_order = api.place_order(symbol, 'sell', best_ask + 0.01, 0.1)

            time.sleep(10)  # Adjust based on market conditions

            # Cancel orders if they are not filled within the time window
            api.cancel_order(buy_order['order_id'])
            api.cancel_order(sell_order['order_id'])
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error: {e}")
            time.sleep(10)

market_maker('BTC/USDT')
```

#### Arbitrage

Arbitrage algorithms can exploit price differences between ZBG and other exchanges. This involves continuously monitoring multiple exchanges and executing trades to benefit from discrepancies.

```python
import zbg_api
import binance_api
import time

zbg = zbg_api.ZbgAPI(api_key, api_secret)
binance = binance_api.BinanceAPI(api_key, api_secret)

def arbitrage(symbol):
    while True:
        try:
            zbg_price = zbg.get_ticker(symbol)['last']
            binance_price = binance.get_ticker(symbol)['last']

            if zbg_price < binance_price:
                # Buy on ZBG, sell on Binance
                zbg_balance = zbg.get_balance('USDT')
                binance_balance = binance.get_balance('BTC')

                if zbg_balance > 10 and binance_balance > 0.001:  # Example thresholds
                    zbg.buy_order(symbol, zbg_price, 0.001)
                    binance.sell_order(symbol, binance_price, 0.001)
                    
            elif zbg_price > binance_price:
                # Sell on ZBG, buy on Binance
                zbg_balance = zbg.get_balance('BTC')
                binance_balance = binance.get_balance('USDT')

                if zbg_balance > 0.001 and binance_balance > 10:  # Example thresholds
                    zbg.sell_order(symbol, zbg_price, 0.001)
                    binance.buy_order(symbol, binance_price, 0.001)

            time.sleep(5)  # Adjust based on market conditions
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error: {e}")
            time.sleep(10)

arbitrage('BTC/USDT')
```

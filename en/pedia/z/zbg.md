# ZBG

ZBG is a cryptocurrency [exchange](../e/exchange.md) that specializes in providing a platform for trading a [wide variety](../w/wide_variety.md) of digital assets. As part of the ZB Group ecosystem, ZBG offers a [range](../r/range.md) of services, including spot trading, [margin trading](../m/margin_trading.md), perpetual contracts, and token listing services. Founded in 2018, ZBG aims to provide a secure, efficient, and user-friendly trading experience backed by [robust](../r/robust.md) technology and stringent [security](../s/security.md) measures.

## Key Features

### Trading Services
ZBG provides a comprehensive suite of trading services to cater to different types of traders:

1. **Spot Trading**: This is the basic form of trading where users buy and sell cryptocurrencies at current [market](../m/market.md) prices. ZBG offers [multiple](../m/multiple.md) trading pairs, enabling users to diversify their portfolios.

2. **[Margin Trading](../m/margin_trading.md)**: For advanced traders, [margin trading](../m/margin_trading.md) allows users to borrow funds to increase their trading position, providing the potential for higher returns—but also higher risks. ZBG offers flexible [leverage](../l/leverage.md) [options](../o/options.md) to accommodate various [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

3. **Perpetual Contracts**: These are a type of [derivative](../d/derivative.md) that allows traders to speculate on the price of an [asset](../a/asset.md) without actually owning it. ZBG provides perpetual contracts with high [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and low fees, [offering](../o/offering.md) an alternative for those interested in leveraged trading. 

4. **Token Listing Services**: ZBG offers listing services for new tokens, providing them with a platform to reach a broader audience. This includes rigorous listing criteria to ensure high-quality projects.

### Security Measures

To ensure the safety of users’ funds and data, ZBG implements a variety of [security](../s/security.md) measures:

1. **Cold Storage**: The vast majority of user funds are stored in cold wallets, which are offline and thus less vulnerable to hacking.
   
2. **Two-[Factor](../f/factor.md) Authentication (2FA)**: ZBG requires users to enable 2FA, adding an extra layer of [security](../s/security.md) to account access.

3. **KYC/AML Compliance**: ZBG adheres to Know Your [Customer](../c/customer.md) (KYC) and Anti-[Money Laundering](../m/money_laundering.md) (AML) regulations, requiring users to complete identity verification processes.

### Fees

ZBG has a competitive [fee](../f/fee.md) structure designed to attract a wide [range](../r/range.md) of traders:

1. **Trading Fees**: The [exchange](../e/exchange.md) employs a maker-taker model, where the fees are different for [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) providers (makers) and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) takers (takers). Generally, maker fees are lower to encourage [market](../m/market.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).

2. **[Withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) Fees**: Fees vary depending on the cryptocurrency being withdrawn but are generally in line with [industry](../i/industry.md) standards.

3. **[Deposit](../d/deposit.md) Fees**: Deposits in cryptocurrencies are typically free, although fees may apply for fiat deposits depending on the method used.

### ZB Token (ZT)

ZBG has its native [utility](../u/utility.md) token known as ZB Token (ZT). Holding ZT can provide several benefits:

1. **Trading [Fee](../f/fee.md) Discounts**: Users can use ZT to pay for trading fees at a discounted rate.
   
2. **Staking**: Users can stake ZT to earn rewards in the form of additional tokens or [fee](../f/fee.md) rebates.

3. **Voting Rights**: ZT holders may also participate in governance decisions, such as voting for new token listings.

### Community and Support

ZBG places a strong emphasis on community and [customer](../c/customer.md) support. The [exchange](../e/exchange.md) offers:

1. **24/7 [Customer](../c/customer.md) Support**: A dedicated support team is available around the clock to assist with any issues.

## Algorithmic Trading Support

### API Documentation

ZBG provides comprehensive API documentation, which includes:

1. **Public API**: For accessing [market](../m/market.md) data, K-line data, [trade](../t/trade.md) history, and [order book](../o/order_book.md) information.
   
2. **Private API**: For account-specific operations, such as placing and canceling orders, fetching balance information, and [trade](../t/trade.md) executions. 

3. **Websockets**: Real-time data streams to ensure algorithmic traders get the most up-to-date information.

### Technical Specifications

1. **REST API**: ZBG’s REST API allows for synchronous communication, making it suitable for most trading applications.

3. **Rate Limits**: ZBG has specified rate limits to ensure fair usage of their API. Traders must be aware of these limits to avoid bans.

### Example Algorithms

#### Market Making

[Market making algorithms](../m/market_making_algorithms.md) can benefit from ZBG's low maker fees and high [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md). A basic [market](../m/market.md)-making strategy would involve placing both buy and sell limit orders around the current [market price](../m/market_price.md) to capture the [bid-ask spread](../b/bid-ask_spread.md).

```python
[import](../i/import.md) zbg_api
[import](../i/import.md) time

api = zbg_api.ZbgAPI(api_key, api_secret)

def market_maker(symbol):
    while True:
        try:
            order_book = api.get_order_book(symbol)
            best_bid = order_book['bids'][0][0]
            best_ask = order_book['asks'][0][0]

            # Place buy and sell orders around the current price
            buy_order = api.place_order(symbol, 'buy', best_bid - 0.01, 0.1)
            sell_order = api.place_order(symbol, 'sell', best_ask + 0.01, 0.1)

            time.sleep(10)  # Adjust based on [market](../m/market.md) conditions

            # Cancel orders if they are not filled within the time window
            api.cancel_order(buy_order['order_id'])
            api.cancel_order(sell_order['order_id'])
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error: {e}")
            time.sleep(10)

market_maker('BTC/USDT')
```

#### Arbitrage

[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) algorithms can exploit price differences between ZBG and other exchanges. This involves continuously monitoring [multiple](../m/multiple.md) exchanges and executing trades to benefit from discrepancies.

```python
[import](../i/import.md) zbg_api
[import](../i/import.md) binance_api
[import](../i/import.md) time

zbg = zbg_api.ZbgAPI(api_key, api_secret)
[binance](../b/binance.md) = binance_api.BinanceAPI(api_key, api_secret)

def [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)(symbol):
    while True:
        try:
            zbg_price = zbg.get_ticker(symbol)['last']
            binance_price = [binance](../b/binance.md).get_ticker(symbol)['last']

            if zbg_price < binance_price:
                # Buy on ZBG, sell on [Binance](../b/binance.md)
                zbg_balance = zbg.get_balance('USDT')
                binance_balance = [binance](../b/binance.md).get_balance('BTC')

                if zbg_balance > 10 and binance_balance > 0.001:  # Example thresholds
                    zbg.buy_order(symbol, zbg_price, 0.001)
                    [binance](../b/binance.md).sell_order(symbol, binance_price, 0.001)
                    
            elif zbg_price > binance_price:
                # Sell on ZBG, buy on [Binance](../b/binance.md)
                zbg_balance = zbg.get_balance('BTC')
                binance_balance = [binance](../b/binance.md).get_balance('USDT')

                if zbg_balance > 0.001 and binance_balance > 10:  # Example thresholds
                    zbg.sell_order(symbol, zbg_price, 0.001)
                    [binance](../b/binance.md).buy_order(symbol, binance_price, 0.001)

            time.sleep(5)  # Adjust based on [market](../m/market.md) conditions
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error: {e}")
            time.sleep(10)

[arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)('BTC/USDT')
```

# Zombies in Finance

In the realm of [finance](../f/finance.md), the term "zombies" or "zombie companies" is used to describe businesses that are generating just enough [revenue](../r/revenue.md) to continue operating and service their [debt](../d/debt.md), but are unable to make any significant [profit](../p/profit.md) or growth. These companies are typically reliant on external [financing](../f/financing.md) to survive and often have below-average [credit](../c/credit.md) ratings. While the phenomenon has been around for decades, it has become particularly notable in the post-2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) era, exacerbated by low [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) environments and extensive monetary interventions by central banks.

## Characteristics of Zombie Companies

Several key characteristics define zombie companies:

1. **High [Leverage](../l/leverage.md):** They often have substantial amounts of [debt](../d/debt.md) relative to their [earnings](../e/earnings.md) or [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md).
2. **Low Profitability:** These companies exhibit minimal or negative profitability, struggling to cover operational and financial [obligations](../o/obligation.md).
3. **Limited Growth:** They lack the financial resources for [capital](../c/capital.md) investments, research and development, or [market](../m/market.md) [expansion](../e/expansion.md).
4. **Dependence on [Financing](../f/financing.md):** Their survival hinges on continuous external [financing](../f/financing.md), either through loans, [credit](../c/credit.md) facilities, or [equity](../e/equity.md) injections.

## Causes of Zombie Companies

The proliferation of zombie companies can be attributed to several factors:

### Low-Interest Rates

In periods of low-[interest](../i/interest.md) rates, borrowing costs are minimized. This allows financially weak companies to [rollover](../r/rollover.md) existing [debt](../d/debt.md) and acquire new [financing](../f/financing.md) more easily, despite their poor economic fundamentals.

### Financial Market Interventions

Central banks and governments, particularly during economic crises, might intervene by purchasing corporate bonds or providing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) to the [market](../m/market.md). This intervention can artificially sustain nonviable companies that would have otherwise defaulted.

### Regulatory Policies

[Bank](../b/bank.md) regulations, such as those seen in Japan during the 1990s’ “[Lost Decade](../l/lost_decade.md),” can create environments where banks are incentivized to continue extending [credit](../c/credit.md) to failing businesses to avoid realizing losses on their balance sheets.

## Economic Implications

The presence of zombie companies has several significant implications for the broader [economy](../e/economy.md):

### Resource Misallocation

By [tying](../t/tying.md) up [capital](../c/capital.md), labor, and material resources in unproductive enterprises, zombie companies prevent these resources from being deployed in more profitable or innovative uses. This misallocation can stifle overall [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) and innovation.

### Market Distortion

Zombie companies can distort competitive dynamics in their industries. Able to survive with continuous [financing](../f/financing.md), these firms may engage in aggressive pricing or other non-[market](../m/market.md) behaviors that challenge healthier competitors.

### Financial Stability Risks

A proliferation of zombie companies can increase [systemic risk](../s/systemic_risk.md) within the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md). If external conditions change—such as a rise in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates or tightening of [credit](../c/credit.md) conditions—a large number of zombie companies might [default](../d/default.md) simultaneously, potentially leading to broader financial instability.

## Identification of Zombie Companies

Identifying zombie companies involves analyzing several financial metrics:

### Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR)

This metric is calculated by dividing a company's [earnings](../e/earnings.md) before [interest](../i/interest.md) and [taxes](../t/taxes.md) (EBIT) by its [interest](../i/interest.md) expenses. A ratio below 1 indicates that the company cannot cover its [interest](../i/interest.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md) from [operating earnings](../o/operating_earnings.md), signifying potential zombie characteristics.

### Debt-to-Equity Ratio

A high [debt](../d/debt.md)-to-[equity](../e/equity.md) ratio suggests a company is heavily reliant on [debt financing](../d/debt_financing.md). While not conclusive on its own, it can be indicative when assessed alongside profitability measures.

### Credit Ratings

Sub-investment-grade [credit](../c/credit.md) ratings (below BBB- by Standard & Poor’s and Fitch, or Baa3 by Moody’s) can also signal higher [financial distress](../f/financial_distress.md) [risk](../r/risk.md), although they must be interpreted in the broader context of company-specific factors.

## Case Studies

### Japan’s Lost Decade

Japan’s economic [stagnation](../s/stagnation.md) in the 1990s is often cited as a prime example of the zombie company phenomenon. Following the bursting of a [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) and [stock market](../s/stock_market.md) bubble, Japanese banks, facing significant non-performing loans, opted to extend further [credit](../c/credit.md) to failing businesses to avoid realizing losses. These zombie firms proliferated, significantly hampering Japan’s [economic recovery](../e/economic_recovery.md).

### Post-GFC Environment

In the wake of the 2008 Global [Financial Crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) (GFC), similar dynamics have been observed globally, amplified by prolonged periods of low-[interest](../i/interest.md) rates and [quantitative easing](../q/quantitative_easing.md) measures implemented by central banks. Studies by the [Bank](../b/bank.md) for International Settlements (BIS) have highlighted the rising prevalence of zombie firms in advanced economies during this period.

## Addressing the Zombie Problem

Addressing the [issue](../i/issue.md) of zombie companies involves both macroeconomic and microeconomic policy measures:

### Enhanced Bankruptcy and Resolution Mechanisms

Streamlining [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) procedures and strengthening resolution frameworks can facilitate the exit of nonviable companies from the [market](../m/market.md), reallocating resources towards more productive uses.

### Tightening Credit Conditions

Balancing the [provision](../p/provision.md) of [credit](../c/credit.md) is crucial. While excessive tightening can [strangle](../s/strangle.md) healthy but temporarily struggling businesses, ensuring that [credit](../c/credit.md) is more selective can reduce the sustainment of unviable firms.

### Incentivizing Investment in Productivity

Governments and policymakers can promote investment in [productivity](../p/productivity.md)-enhancing initiatives, such as research and development, [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md), and education, fostering an environment where efficient resource allocation is rewarded.

## The Future of Zombie Companies

As economies navigate post-pandemic recoveries, questions about the sustainability of zombie companies remain pertinent. Central banks face the delicate task of normalizing [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) without triggering widespread insolvencies. Meanwhile, policymakers must consider long-term structural reforms to mitigate the risks associated with zombie firms, ensuring more resilient economic foundations for future growth.

# Zombies in Finance

In the realm of finance, the term "zombies" or "zombie companies" is used to describe businesses that are generating just enough revenue to continue operating and service their debt, but are unable to make any significant profit or growth. These companies are typically reliant on external financing to survive and often have below-average credit ratings. While the phenomenon has been around for decades, it has become particularly notable in the post-2008 financial crisis era, exacerbated by low interest rate environments and extensive monetary interventions by central banks.

## Characteristics of Zombie Companies

Several key characteristics define zombie companies:

1. **High Leverage:** They often have substantial amounts of debt relative to their earnings or cash flow.
2. **Low Profitability:** These companies exhibit minimal or negative profitability, struggling to cover operational and financial obligations.
3. **Limited Growth:** They lack the financial resources for capital investments, research and development, or market expansion.
4. **Dependence on Financing:** Their survival hinges on continuous external financing, either through loans, credit facilities, or equity injections.

## Causes of Zombie Companies

The proliferation of zombie companies can be attributed to several factors:

### Low-Interest Rates

In periods of low-interest rates, borrowing costs are minimized. This allows financially weak companies to rollover existing debt and acquire new financing more easily, despite their poor economic fundamentals.

### Financial Market Interventions

Central banks and governments, particularly during economic crises, might intervene by purchasing corporate bonds or providing liquidity to the market. This intervention can artificially sustain nonviable companies that would have otherwise defaulted.

### Regulatory Policies

Bank regulations, such as those seen in Japan during the 1990s’ “Lost Decade,” can create environments where banks are incentivized to continue extending credit to failing businesses to avoid realizing losses on their balance sheets.

## Economic Implications

The presence of zombie companies has several significant implications for the broader economy:

### Resource Misallocation

By tying up capital, labor, and material resources in unproductive enterprises, zombie companies prevent these resources from being deployed in more profitable or innovative uses. This misallocation can stifle overall economic growth and innovation.

### Market Distortion

Zombie companies can distort competitive dynamics in their industries. Able to survive with continuous financing, these firms may engage in aggressive pricing or other non-market behaviors that challenge healthier competitors.

### Financial Stability Risks

A proliferation of zombie companies can increase systemic risk within the financial system. If external conditions change—such as a rise in interest rates or tightening of credit conditions—a large number of zombie companies might default simultaneously, potentially leading to broader financial instability.

## Identification of Zombie Companies

Identifying zombie companies involves analyzing several financial metrics:

### Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR)

This metric is calculated by dividing a company's earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) by its interest expenses. A ratio below 1 indicates that the company cannot cover its interest obligations from operating earnings, signifying potential zombie characteristics.

### Debt-to-Equity Ratio

A high debt-to-equity ratio suggests a company is heavily reliant on debt financing. While not conclusive on its own, it can be indicative when assessed alongside profitability measures.

### Credit Ratings

Sub-investment-grade credit ratings (below BBB- by Standard & Poor’s and Fitch, or Baa3 by Moody’s) can also signal higher financial distress risk, although they must be interpreted in the broader context of company-specific factors.

## Case Studies

### Japan’s Lost Decade

Japan’s economic stagnation in the 1990s is often cited as a prime example of the zombie company phenomenon. Following the bursting of a real estate and stock market bubble, Japanese banks, facing significant non-performing loans, opted to extend further credit to failing businesses to avoid realizing losses. These zombie firms proliferated, significantly hampering Japan’s economic recovery.

### Post-GFC Environment

In the wake of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC), similar dynamics have been observed globally, amplified by prolonged periods of low-interest rates and quantitative easing measures implemented by central banks. Studies by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) have highlighted the rising prevalence of zombie firms in advanced economies during this period.

## Addressing the Zombie Problem

Addressing the issue of zombie companies involves both macroeconomic and microeconomic policy measures:

### Enhanced Bankruptcy and Resolution Mechanisms

Streamlining bankruptcy procedures and strengthening resolution frameworks can facilitate the exit of nonviable companies from the market, reallocating resources towards more productive uses.

### Tightening Credit Conditions

Balancing the provision of credit is crucial. While excessive tightening can strangle healthy but temporarily struggling businesses, ensuring that credit is more selective can reduce the sustainment of unviable firms.

### Incentivizing Investment in Productivity

Governments and policymakers can promote investment in productivity-enhancing initiatives, such as research and development, infrastructure, and education, fostering an environment where efficient resource allocation is rewarded.

## The Future of Zombie Companies

As economies navigate post-pandemic recoveries, questions about the sustainability of zombie companies remain pertinent. Central banks face the delicate task of normalizing monetary policy without triggering widespread insolvencies. Meanwhile, policymakers must consider long-term structural reforms to mitigate the risks associated with zombie firms, ensuring more resilient economic foundations for future growth.

# Zero Coupon Bond Risk

Zero-Coupon Bonds, also known as "[discount](../d/discount.md) bonds" or "pure [discount](../d/discount.md) bonds," are a type of [fixed-income security](../f/fixed-income_security.md) that do not make periodic [interest](../i/interest.md) payments or "coupons" to the [bondholder](../b/bondholder.md). Instead, they are issued at a [discount](../d/discount.md) to their [face value](../f/face_value.md) and mature at [par value](../p/par_value.md), [offering](../o/offering.md) a [profit](../p/profit.md) for the [investor](../i/investor.md) when the [bond](../b/bond.md) matures. While zero-coupon bonds can be attractive due to their simplicity and potential for long-term gains, they come with several types of risks that investors need to consider.

## Price Volatility

One of the primary risks associated with zero-coupon bonds is their high price [volatility](../v/volatility.md). Because these bonds don't provide periodic [interest](../i/interest.md) payments, their prices can be significantly more sensitive to changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates compared to coupon-bearing bonds. This phenomenon is due to the concept of "[duration](../d/duration.md)" in [bond](../b/bond.md) pricing. [Duration](../d/duration.md) measures the sensitivity of a [bond](../b/bond.md)'s price to [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) changes; the longer the [duration](../d/duration.md), the more sensitive the [bond](../b/bond.md) is to [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) fluctuations. Zero-coupon bonds typically have longer durations since the entire [return](../r/return.md) is concentrated at [maturity](../m/maturity.md), making their prices highly volatile.

### Example:

Suppose an [investor](../i/investor.md) purchases a 10-year [zero-coupon bond](../z/zero-coupon_bond.md) for $600 with a [face value](../f/face_value.md) of $1,000. If [market](../m/market.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) rates rise, the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s future [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) (the $1,000 at [maturity](../m/maturity.md)) decreases, causing the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s price to drop substantially more than it would for a comparable coupon [bond](../b/bond.md). Conversely, if [interest](../i/interest.md) rates fall, the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s price [will](../w/will.md) increase significantly.

## Reinvestment Risk

While zero-coupon bonds eliminate the [reinvestment risk](../r/reinvestment_risk.md) associated with periodic [interest](../i/interest.md) payments, they still carry some level of [reinvestment risk](../r/reinvestment_risk.md) related to the final lump sum [payment](../p/payment.md) received at [maturity](../m/maturity.md). If the [investor](../i/investor.md) plans to reinvest the proceeds from a maturing [zero-coupon bond](../z/zero-coupon_bond.md), they face the [risk](../r/risk.md) that the prevailing [interest](../i/interest.md) rates at the time of [reinvestment](../r/reinvestment.md) may be lower than the original [bond](../b/bond.md)'s [yield](../y/yield.md), diminishing the anticipated returns on new investments.

### Example:

An [investor](../i/investor.md) purchasing a [zero-coupon bond](../z/zero-coupon_bond.md) expecting a [yield](../y/yield.md) of 5% per annum might find that upon [maturity](../m/maturity.md), the [interest](../i/interest.md) rates have fallen to 3%. If they aim to reinvest their matured [principal](../p/principal.md) for a similar [duration](../d/duration.md), their future returns [will](../w/will.md) be lower.

## Inflation Risk

[Inflation](../i/inflation.md) can dramatically affect the [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) of the returns from a [zero-coupon bond](../z/zero-coupon_bond.md). Since the [bondholder](../b/bondholder.md) only receives a single [payment](../p/payment.md) at [maturity](../m/maturity.md), the actual [value](../v/value.md) of this [payment](../p/payment.md) could be eroded by [inflation](../i/inflation.md). In environments where [inflation](../i/inflation.md) is high or accelerating, the real returns on a [zero-coupon bond](../z/zero-coupon_bond.md) may be significantly lower than the [nominal](../n/nominal.md) returns.

### Example:

An [investor](../i/investor.md) purchases a [zero-coupon bond](../z/zero-coupon_bond.md) for $500, expecting to receive $1,000 in 20 years. If the annual [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rate over the period is 3%, the real [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) of $1,000 in 20 years would be significantly reduced compared to today's terms.

## Credit Risk

Zero-coupon bonds are subject to [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md), which is the [risk](../r/risk.md) that the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) may [default](../d/default.md) on their [payment](../p/payment.md) at [maturity](../m/maturity.md). This type of [risk](../r/risk.md) depends mainly on the [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) of the [issuer](../i/issuer.md). Government-issued zero-coupon bonds like U.S. [Treasury STRIPS](../t/treasury_strips.md) typically have lower [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md), whereas corporate zero-coupon bonds may have higher [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) depending on the [issuer](../i/issuer.md)'s financial stability.

### Example:

An [investor](../i/investor.md) buying a [zero-coupon bond](../z/zero-coupon_bond.md) from a company with a BBB [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) should be aware that changes in the company's [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) could affect their ability to repay the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s [face value](../f/face_value.md) at [maturity](../m/maturity.md). If the company's [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) is downgraded, the [market value](../m/market_value.md) of the [bond](../b/bond.md) [will](../w/will.md) decrease as the perceived [risk](../r/risk.md) of [default](../d/default.md) increases.

## Liquidity Risk

[Liquidity risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md) refers to the [risk](../r/risk.md) that an [investor](../i/investor.md) may not be able to sell the [zero-coupon bond](../z/zero-coupon_bond.md) quickly without significantly affecting its price. Zero-coupon bonds are often less [liquid](../l/liquid.md) than coupon-bearing bonds because they are less attractive to a broad [range](../r/range.md) of investors, particularly those seeking regular [income](../i/income.md). 

### Example:

An [investor](../i/investor.md) holding a zero-coupon [municipal bond](../m/municipal_bond.md) may find it challenging to sell the [bond](../b/bond.md) in a [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md) if there are fewer buyers interested in purchasing it. The [bid-ask spread](../b/bid-ask_spread.md) in such markets could be wide, resulting in a potentially lower selling price.

## Tax Implications

Zero-coupon bonds often have complex tax implications. In many jurisdictions, even though the [investor](../i/investor.md) does not receive periodic [interest](../i/interest.md) payments, they may still owe [taxes](../t/taxes.md) on the "imputed" or "phantom" [interest](../i/interest.md) that accrues each year. This [imputed interest](../i/imputed_interest.md) is the difference between the purchase price and the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s [face value](../f/face_value.md), divided by the number of years until [maturity](../m/maturity.md).

### Example:

An [investor](../i/investor.md) who buys a [zero-coupon bond](../z/zero-coupon_bond.md) for $400 that matures at $1,000 in 12 years would need to pay [taxes](../t/taxes.md) on the annual [imputed interest](../i/imputed_interest.md). Even though they don't receive actual [interest](../i/interest.md) payments, the IRS requires the [investor](../i/investor.md) to report the accrued but unpaid [interest](../i/interest.md) as [income](../i/income.md) each year, which can create a [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md) without a corresponding cash inflow.

## Early Redemption Risk

Some zero-coupon bonds, particularly those issued by municipalities or corporations, may come with a call feature that allows the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) to redeem the [bond](../b/bond.md) before it matures. This call feature can introduce early [redemption risk](../r/redemption_risk.md), as the [bond](../b/bond.md) may be paid off early if [interest](../i/interest.md) rates fall or if the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) chooses to [refinance](../r/refinance.md) the [debt](../d/debt.md).

### Example:

An [investor](../i/investor.md) holding a 20-year [zero-coupon bond](../z/zero-coupon_bond.md) might face early [redemption](../r/redemption.md) if the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) decides to call the [bond](../b/bond.md) after 10 years. This could be disadvantageous to the [investor](../i/investor.md) if the [bond](../b/bond.md) was called in a low-[interest](../i/interest.md)-rate environment, forcing them to reinvest the proceeds at lower rates than initially anticipated.

## Market Risk

[Market risk](../m/market_risk.md), or [systemic risk](../s/systemic_risk.md), is the [risk](../r/risk.md) that the overall [market](../m/market.md) conditions may affect the [value](../v/value.md) of zero-coupon bonds. Economic downturns, changes in [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md), or financial crises can lead to significant fluctuations in [bond](../b/bond.md) prices, affecting zero-coupon bonds as well.

### Example:

During the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) of 2008, the [market](../m/market.md) experienced a massive sell-off across various [asset](../a/asset.md) classes, including bonds. [Zero-coupon bond](../z/zero-coupon_bond.md) prices, particularly those issued by corporations, dropped as investors rushed to more [liquid](../l/liquid.md) and perceived safer assets such as U.S. Treasuries or cash.

## Yield Curve Risk

[Yield curve](../y/yield_curve.md) [risk](../r/risk.md) refers to the [risk](../r/risk.md) of adverse movements in the [yield curve](../y/yield_curve.md), affecting the relative attractiveness of bonds of varying maturities. Zero-coupon bonds with long maturities are more sensitive to changes in the shape and level of the [yield curve](../y/yield_curve.md).

### Example:

If the [yield curve](../y/yield_curve.md) flattens or inverts, the [relative value](../r/relative_value.md) of long-term zero-coupon bonds may decrease compared to medium-term or short-term bonds. Investors may [demand](../d/demand.md) higher yields for long-term bonds, decreasing their [market price](../m/market_price.md).

---

Investors considering zero-coupon bonds should weigh these risks carefully against their financial goals and [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md). Diversifying across a [range](../r/range.md) of investments and maturities can help mitigate some of these risks, providing balanced exposure to the potential benefits of zero-coupon bonds while managing their inherent risks.

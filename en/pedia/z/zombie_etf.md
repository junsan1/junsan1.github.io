# Zombie ETF

In the vast and diversified landscape of [Exchange](../e/exchange.md)-Traded Funds (ETFs), certain funds have earned the moniker "Zombie ETFs." These are ETFs that have failed to attract substantial [investor](../i/investor.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) and, as a result, struggle with low levels of assets under management (AUM) and trading [volume](../v/volume.md). This comprehensive guide delves into the fundamental aspects of Zombie ETFs, their impacts, causes, and potential strategies for investors and [fund](../f/fund.md) managers.

## Definition and Characteristics

### What are Zombie ETFs?

Zombie ETFs are funds that generally exhibit the following traits:

1. **Low Assets Under Management (AUM):** These ETFs have assets below a certain threshold, typically considered to be around $50 million, which is often seen as the minimum required to cover operational costs.
2. **Low Trading [Volume](../v/volume.md):** These ETFs have consistently low daily trading [volume](../v/volume.md), making it difficult for investors to buy or sell [shares](../s/shares.md) without significantly impacting the price.
3. **Lack of [Investor](../i/investor.md) [Interest](../i/interest.md):** Despite being [listed](../l/listed.md), these ETFs [fail](../f/fail.md) to attract [investor](../i/investor.md) attention, either because of poor performance, lack of differentiation from other products, or inadequate [marketing](../m/marketing.md) by the [fund manager](../f/fund_manager.md).

### Why are they called 'Zombie' ETFs?

The term "Zombie" is used because, like mythical zombies, these ETFs are technically alive (i.e., they exist and are [listed](../l/listed.md) on exchanges), but they don't exhibit the typical signs of healthy life, such as growth and vitality. They linger without showing significant signs of growth or attracting new [capital](../c/capital.md).

## Factors Leading to the Creation of Zombie ETFs

### Poor Market Conditions

[Market](../m/market.md) conditions, such as economic downturns or sector-specific challenges, can contribute to the creation of Zombie ETFs. In unfavorable [market](../m/market.md) conditions, investors may shy away from certain sectors or investment strategies, leading to low participation in related ETFs.

### Overcrowding in the ETF Market

The ETF [market](../m/market.md) is highly competitive, with thousands of funds available to investors. The proliferation of similar or niche ETFs can lead to overcrowding, making it difficult for new or lesser-known ETFs to [gain](../g/gain.md) traction.

### Inadequate Marketing and Distribution

ETFs that are not adequately marketed or distributed may [fail](../f/fail.md) to reach a broad audience, resulting in low [investor](../i/investor.md) [interest](../i/interest.md). [Marketing](../m/marketing.md) efforts are crucial for educating potential investors on the unique [value proposition](../v/value_proposition.md) of a [fund](../f/fund.md).

### Misalignment with Investor Needs

ETFs that do not align with current [investor](../i/investor.md) needs and preferences are less likely to attract assets. Changes in [market](../m/market.md) trends can render certain investment strategies obsolete or less attractive, leading to decreased [interest](../i/interest.md) in associated ETFs.

## Impacts of Zombie ETFs

### On Investors

Investors holding [shares](../s/shares.md) in Zombie ETFs may face several challenges:

1. **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) Issues:** Low trading volumes can result in wide [bid](../b/bid.md)-ask [spreads](../s/spreads.md), increasing the cost of buying or selling [shares](../s/shares.md).
2. **Tracking Errors:** Zombie ETFs may experience larger tracking errors, where the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s performance deviates from its [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [index](../i/index.md), due to difficulties in managing low [asset](../a/asset.md) levels.
3. **[Risk](../r/risk.md) of Closure:** These ETFs are at a higher [risk](../r/risk.md) of closure or [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md), which can result in tax implications and the need to reinvest proceeds elsewhere.

### On Fund Managers

For [fund](../f/fund.md) managers, maintaining Zombie ETFs can be financially burdensome due to ongoing operational costs that may not be covered by the limited AUM. This situation can lead to:

1. **[Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Loss:** Low AUM results in lower management fees, impacting the profitability of the [fund](../f/fund.md).
2. **Resource Allocation:** [Fund](../f/fund.md) managers may need to allocate resources to manage these funds, diverting attention from more successful products.
3. **Reputation Risks:** Persisting with [multiple](../m/multiple.md) Zombie ETFs can harm a [fund manager](../f/fund_manager.md)'s reputation, signaling to the [market](../m/market.md) that the [firm](../f/firm.md) struggles to launch and maintain successful products.

## Strategies for Managing and Preventing Zombie ETFs

### Consolidation and Merger

One effective strategy is the [consolidation](../c/consolidation.md) or [merger](../m/merger.md) of Zombie ETFs with more successful funds. This approach can help increase the AUM of the surviving [fund](../f/fund.md), potentially improving its viability and reducing operational costs.

### Improved Marketing and Distribution

Enhancing [marketing](../m/marketing.md) and [distribution](../d/distribution.md) efforts can help attract [investor](../i/investor.md) [interest](../i/interest.md). This includes creating educational content, engaging with financial advisors, and leveraging [digital marketing](../d/digital_marketing.md) strategies to reach a broader audience.

### Product Differentiation

[Fund](../f/fund.md) managers should focus on creating unique and differentiated products that meet current [investor](../i/investor.md) needs. This involves staying ahead of [market](../m/market.md) trends and innovating in areas such as [thematic investing](../t/thematic_investing.md), ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) factors, and alternative [asset](../a/asset.md) classes.

### Regular Review and Closure

Regularly reviewing the performance and viability of ETFs can help [fund](../f/fund.md) managers make informed decisions about closing underperforming funds. Timely closure of Zombie ETFs can prevent unnecessary costs and allow the [firm](../f/firm.md) to focus on more promising opportunities.

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Global X Funds

Global X is an ETF [issuer](../i/issuer.md) known for its specialized and thematic ETFs. Despite their diverse product offerings, some of their funds have transformed into Zombie ETFs due to low [investor](../i/investor.md) [interest](../i/interest.md). The [firm](../f/firm.md) has occasionally closed such funds to streamline its offerings.

### Example 2: WisdomTree

WisdomTree is another example of an ETF manager that, over time, has faced challenges with certain funds not attracting sufficient assets. This has led to the closure and [consolidation](../c/consolidation.md) of various ETFs within their portfolio.

## Future Outlook for Zombie ETFs

### Industry Evolution

The ETF [industry](../i/industry.md) continues to evolve, with innovation and competition driving the [market](../m/market.md). The [trend](../t/trend.md) towards more specialized and thematic ETFs is likely to persist, which may contribute to the creation of Zombie ETFs for those funds that [fail](../f/fail.md) to capture [investor](../i/investor.md) [interest](../i/interest.md).

### Role of Technology

Advancements in technology, particularly in areas such as [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) and [artificial intelligence](../a/artificial_intelligence_in_trading.md), have the potential to influence the ETF [market](../m/market.md). These technologies can aid in the creation of more sophisticated and targeted investment strategies, potentially reducing the likelihood of ETFs becoming 'Zombie' by better aligning products with [market](../m/market.md) needs.

### Regulatory Changes

Regulatory changes can also impact the prevalence of Zombie ETFs. For example, new regulations aimed at increasing [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and reducing costs for investors could influence [fund](../f/fund.md) managers' decisions regarding the launch and maintenance of ETFs.

## Conclusion

Zombie ETFs are a notable phenomenon in the ETF [industry](../i/industry.md), reflecting the challenges and dynamics of a highly competitive [market](../m/market.md). Understanding the factors that lead to the creation of Zombie ETFs, their impacts, and strategies for management and prevention is crucial for investors and [fund](../f/fund.md) managers alike. As the [market](../m/market.md) continues to evolve, staying informed and proactive [will](../w/will.md) be key to navigating the challenges and opportunities in the world of ETFs.

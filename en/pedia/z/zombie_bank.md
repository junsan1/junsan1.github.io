# Zombie Bank

## Introduction
The term "zombie [bank](../b/bank.md)" refers to financial institutions that are essentially insolvent but continue to operate due to government support or regulatory [forbearance](../f/forbearance.md). These banks are unable to meet their [debt](../d/debt.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md) or sustain normal banking functions but are kept afloat through government interventions, such as bailouts, subsidies, or relaxed regulatory requirements. Although zombie banks remain in existence, they often contribute to economic [stagnation](../s/stagnation.md) by absorbing financial resources that could be better allocated to more productive sectors of the [economy](../e/economy.md).

## Characteristics of Zombie Banks
Zombie banks exhibit a [range](../r/range.md) of characteristics which can include:

1. **High Levels of Non-Performing Loans (NPLs)**: These banks often have a significant percentage of loans that are unlikely to be repaid, leading to [capital](../c/capital.md) erosion.
2. **Dependence on Government Support**: Unable to sustain themselves independently, these banks rely heavily on public funds or central [bank](../b/bank.md) interventions.
3. **Negative [Net Worth](../n/net_worth.md)**: Zombie banks typically have liabilities that exceed their assets, making them insolvent on a technical [basis](../b/basis.md).
4. **Operational Inefficiencies**: They often face challenges in day-to-day operations, with inefficiencies in [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), compliance, and general administration.
5. **Restricted Lending**: Since they are unable to take on additional risks, zombie banks often limit new lending activities, which stifles [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md).

## Causes of Zombie Banks
Several factors contribute to the creation and perpetuation of zombie banks:

### Financial Crises
Economic downturns, such as the global [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) of 2007-2008, can severely devalue assets held by banks, leading to [insolvency](../i/insolvency.md). In the wake of such crises, some banks become zombies due to the degradation of their financial positions.

### Regulatory Forbearance
Regulatory bodies sometimes allow zombie banks to continue operating in hopes that they [will](../w/will.md) recover. However, this lenience often prevents the necessary [restructuring](../r/restructuring.md) and [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md) that would otherwise redirect resources more efficiently.

### Government Bailouts
Government financial assistance and guarantees can keep insolvent banks afloat. While intended to stabilize the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md), these bailouts can create a [moral hazard](../m/moral_hazard.md) where banks are incentivized to take on excessive [risk](../r/risk.md), assuming they [will](../w/will.md) be rescued if things go awry.

### Interest Rate Policies
Extended periods of low-[interest](../i/interest.md) rates can mask the [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) of banks by reducing borrowing costs and propping up [asset](../a/asset.md) prices. However, this also discourages banks from conducting thorough [risk](../r/risk.md) assessments, leading to hidden insolvencies.

## Impacts of Zombie Banks
The existence of zombie banks can have several adverse effects on an [economy](../e/economy.md):

### Capital Misallocation
Zombie banks consume [capital](../c/capital.md) and other resources that could be utilized more effectively by healthier institutions. This misallocation impedes [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) and [productivity](../p/productivity.md).

### Market Distortion
These banks often engage in "evergreening" of loans, extending additional [credit](../c/credit.md) to economically unviable firms to avoid recognizing losses on their balance sheets. This distorts [market](../m/market.md) competition and sustains inefficiencies within the [economy](../e/economy.md).

### Prolonged Economic Stagnation
When banks are unable to lend effectively, businesses and consumers face difficulties in obtaining funds for investment or consumption, contributing to prolonged economic sluggishness.

### Erosion of Confidence
The continued existence of zombie banks can erode public and [investor](../i/investor.md) confidence in the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md), leading to diminished participation in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and reduced willingness to invest.

## Historical Examples of Zombie Banks
Several historical examples illustrate the prevalence and impact of zombie banks:

### Japanese Banking Crisis (1990s)
Following the burst of the [asset](../a/asset.md) price bubble in Japan during the early 1990s, many Japanese banks became insolvent but continued to operate due to government intervention. This prolonged the countryâ€™s economic [stagnation](../s/stagnation.md), often referred to as the "[Lost Decade](../l/lost_decade.md)".

### Savings and Loan Crisis (1980s)
In the United States, the Savings and [Loan](../l/loan.md) Crisis of the 1980s saw numerous thrift institutions become insolvent. Regulatory [forbearance](../f/forbearance.md) and government bailouts allowed these institutions to continue operating, exacerbating the crisis and resulting in substantial [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) burdens.

### European Debt Crisis (Post-2009)
In the aftermath of the 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md), several European banks, particularly in countries like Greece, Italy, and Spain, faced severe [financial distress](../f/financial_distress.md). Continued governmental support and slow reforms led to the prevalence of zombie banks that hindered the [economic recovery](../e/economic_recovery.md) of these regions.

## Strategies to Deal with Zombie Banks
Addressing the problem of zombie banks requires multi-faceted strategies:

### Bank Resolution Mechanisms
Implementing effective resolution mechanisms, such as those outlined by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), ensures that insolvent banks are either restructured or liquidated in an orderly manner without destabilizing the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md).

### Recapitalization
Recapitalizing banks through private [capital](../c/capital.md) injections or public funds can restore their [solvency](../s/solvency.md). However, this should be accompanied by strict conditionality to ensure that banks [return](../r/return.md) to healthy operations and governance.

### Asset Quality Reviews
Conducting thorough [asset](../a/asset.md) quality reviews (AQRs) can help accurately assess the balance sheets of banks, enabling more informed regulatory and policy decisions.

### Stricter Supervision and Regulation
Enhancing supervisory frameworks to enforce stricter compliance with [capital](../c/capital.md) adequacy, [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) standards can prevent the emergence of zombie banks.

### Encouraging Mergers and Acquisitions
Facilitating the [merger](../m/merger.md) or [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) of zombie banks by healthier institutions can consolidate the banking sector and remove inefficiencies, contributing to an overall stronger [financial system](../f/financial_system.md).

## Conclusion
Zombie banks pose a significant threat to economic stability and growth. While governmental support and regulatory [forbearance](../f/forbearance.md) can provide temporary relief, they often lead to prolonged economic inefficiencies and [stagnation](../s/stagnation.md). Addressing zombie banks requires a combination of resolute regulatory actions, effective [recapitalization](../r/recapitalization.md) strategies, and continuous monitoring to ensure that financial institutions operate in a sound and sustainable manner. The lessons learned from past crises underscore the importance of swift and decisive action to manage and mitigate the risks associated with zombie banks.

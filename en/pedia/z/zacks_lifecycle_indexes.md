# Zacks Lifecycle Indexes

The Zacks Lifecycle Indexes are innovative financial tools designed to track the performance of a diversified portfolio of [exchange](../e/exchange.md)-traded funds (ETFs) that are rebalanced annually to reflect a target retirement date. These indexes are developed by [Zacks Investment Research](../z/zacks_investment_research.md), a leading provider of investment research and financial data. They are particularly popular among investors who utilize lifecycle or target-date [investing](../i/investing.md) strategies, which are designed to be appropriate for an individual's [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) depending on their stage in life and proximity to retirement.

The purpose of Zacks Lifecycle Indexes is to [offer](../o/offer.md) a diversified investment approach that systematically reduces [risk](../r/risk.md) as the target date (usually associated with retirement) approaches. The indexes achieve this by adjusting the allocation of assets in a manner designed to maximize returns while gradually lessening exposure to riskier assets like [stocks](../s/stock.md) in favor of more stable investments like bonds and [cash equivalents](../c/cash_equivalents.md).

## Structure of Zacks Lifecycle Indexes

Zacks Lifecycle Indexes typically include various [asset](../a/asset.md) classes and are designed with specific target years in mind, which are reflected in their names (e.g., Zacks 2030 Lifecycle [Index](../i/index.md), Zacks 2040 Lifecycle [Index](../i/index.md)). Each [index](../i/index.md) comprises different types of ETFs, which may include [equity](../e/equity.md), fixed-[income](../i/income.md), and other [asset](../a/asset.md) classes, reflecting the diversified structure of a [target-date fund](../t/target-date_fund.md).

### Equity Funds

The [equity](../e/equity.md) portion of the lifecycle indexes is generally represented through ETFs that track a broad [range](../r/range.md) of [market](../m/market.md) sectors, including domestic large-cap, [mid-cap](../m/mid-cap.md), small-cap, and international equities. The [equity](../e/equity.md) allocation of the [index](../i/index.md) is typically higher for indexes with target dates that are further into the future.

### Fixed-Income Funds

Fixed-[income](../i/income.md) investment exposure is provided through ETFs that [hold](../h/hold.md) government securities, corporate bonds, and other [debt](../d/debt.md) instruments. These investments become increasingly significant as the target date nears to ensure [capital preservation](../c/capital_preservation.md) and stable [income](../i/income.md) generation.

### Other Asset Classes

To achieve further [diversification](../d/diversification.md), lifecycle indexes may also include allocations to [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), commodities, or other alternative investments. This is done to lessen the [correlation](../c/correlation.md) between [asset](../a/asset.md) classes and to help achieve more stable returns over time.

## Rebalancing Mechanism

A key feature of Zacks Lifecycle Indexes is the annual [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) mechanism. This process involves adjusting the allocations within the [index](../i/index.md) to gradually shift from higher-[risk](../r/risk.md), high-[return](../r/return.md) investments (typically equities) to lower-[risk](../r/risk.md), lower-[return](../r/return.md) investments (typically bonds and [cash equivalents](../c/cash_equivalents.md)) as the [index](../i/index.md) approaches its target date. This transition is designed to reduce the portfolio's exposure to [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and protect the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s [capital](../c/capital.md).

### Glide Path

The [glide path](../g/glide_path.md) is the formula that determines the [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) over time. Early in the [investment horizon](../i/investment_horizon.md), the [glide path](../g/glide_path.md) emphasizes growth assets like equities. As the target date approaches, the [glide path](../g/glide_path.md) gradually reduces exposure to equities and increases the allocation to fixed-[income](../i/income.md) securities and other conservative investments. This shift helps preserve [capital](../c/capital.md) and reduce the impact of [market](../m/market.md) downturns near retirement.

## Investment Strategy

Zacks Lifecycle Indexes are fundamentally grounded in the principles of lifecycle or target-date [investing](../i/investing.md). This [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) is based on the assumption that investors should take on higher [risk](../r/risk.md) when they are younger and gradually reduce their [risk](../r/risk.md) as they age.

### Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon

The primary inputs into the [lifecycle investing](../l/lifecycle_investing.md) strategy are the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) and [time horizon](../t/time_horizon.md). [Risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) defines how much [market](../m/market.md) fluctuation an [investor](../i/investor.md) is comfortable with, while the [time horizon](../t/time_horizon.md) indicates how long the [investor](../i/investor.md) plans to keep their [money](../m/money.md) invested before needing to withdraw it.

### Diversification

[Diversification](../d/diversification.md) lies at the core of [lifecycle investing](../l/lifecycle_investing.md). By combining various [asset](../a/asset.md) classes, sectors, and geographies, Zacks Lifecycle Indexes aim to balance the [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md) preferences of investors across different stages of their investment cycle.

## Advantages of Zacks Lifecycle Indexes

### Simplicity and Convenience

One of the major advantages of lifecycle indexes is their simplicity. Investors looking for a "set-it-and-forget-it" [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) can benefit from the automatic [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) feature of these indices, which eliminates the need for ongoing adjustments.

### Professional Management

The indexes [leverage](../l/leverage.md) the expertise of [Zacks Investment Research](../z/zacks_investment_research.md) in selecting and [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) the portfolio of ETFs, which can be advantageous for investors who lack the time or expertise to manage their investments actively.

### Reduced Risk Over Time

Thanks to the [glide path](../g/glide_path.md) and annual [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md), Zacks Lifecycle Indexes systematically reduce exposure to higher-[risk](../r/risk.md) assets as the [investor](../i/investor.md) nears retirement, aiming to protect the [capital](../c/capital.md) and provide a stable [income](../i/income.md) stream.

## Use Cases

### Individual Investors

Individual investors who prefer a hands-off approach to retirement savings can find Zacks Lifecycle Indexes a valuable tool. By selecting an [index](../i/index.md) appropriate for their expected retirement year, investors can ensure their portfolios are managed in accordance with their changing [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) over time.

### Retirement Plans

Many employer-sponsored retirement plans, such as 401(k) plans, include [lifecycle funds](../l/lifecycle_funds.md) based on indexes like those created by Zacks. These funds [offer](../o/offer.md) employees a straightforward option to save for retirement with a professionally managed, diversified portfolio.

## Competitors and Market Position

Zacks Lifecycle Indexes compete with other target-date indexes and funds offered by prominent financial institutions, including Vanguard, Fidelity, and T. Rowe Price. These competitors also provide target-date investment products designed to adjust [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) automatically based on a specified retirement date.

Despite the competitive [market](../m/market.md), [Zacks Investment Research](../z/zacks_investment_research.md) differentiates its lifecycle indexes through the use of proprietary selection criteria and an evidence-based approach to [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) and [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md). Investors seeking to [leverage](../l/leverage.md) the research and expertise of Zacks can find these indexes a compelling option.

## Conclusion

Zacks Lifecycle Indexes [offer](../o/offer.md) a systematic, evidence-based approach to target-date [investing](../i/investing.md), aiming to balance growth and [risk](../r/risk.md) reduction as retirement nears. With their annual [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) mechanism and diversified [asset](../a/asset.md) allocations, these indexes provide both simplicity and professional management for investors planning for future financial needs. By choosing an [index](../i/index.md) aligned with their retirement year, investors can benefit from a carefully managed portfolio that evolves over time to suit their changing [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) and [investment horizon](../i/investment_horizon.md).

# Zaif

Zaif is a cryptocurrency exchange platform based in Japan, which originally launched in 2015. It offers a range of services including cryptocurrency trading, margin trading, and token issuance. The platform is well-known for its unique features and regulatory compliance, making it a significant player in the Japanese cryptocurrency market.

## Overview

Zaif was founded by Tech Bureau, a technology firm specializing in blockchain solutions. Over the years, Zaif has garnered considerable attention due to its user-friendly interface, robust performance, and a variety of supported cryptocurrencies. The platform allows traders to buy, sell, and trade various digital assets including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and many other altcoins.

## Services Offered

### Cryptocurrency Trading

Zaif provides a comprehensive trading platform where users can trade numerous cryptocurrencies against both fiat currencies (such as JPY) and other digital assets. The platform supports various trading pairs, which makes it versatile for different trading strategies. The user interface is designed to cater to both beginners and advanced traders, offering tools like charts, order books, and advanced order types.

### Margin Trading

In addition to standard trading, Zaif also offers margin trading options. This service allows traders to leverage their positions to potentially increase their returns. However, margin trading also comes with heightened risk, requiring traders to exercise caution and employ risk management strategies.

### Token Issuance

Zaif provides a token issuance platform, where businesses can create and issue their own tokens using Zaif's blockchain technology. This service is particularly useful for startups and companies looking to raise funds through Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) or Security Token Offerings (STOs).

## Regulatory Compliance

Zaif operates under strict regulatory guidelines set forth by the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA). The exchange is registered and compliant with local laws, ensuring a legal and secure trading environment for its users. Following a significant security breach in 2018, Zaif has reinforced its security measures and has continued to build trust among its users.

## Security Features

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Zaif employs Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) to provide an additional layer of security. This requires users to verify their identity through a secondary device, usually a mobile phone, making unauthorized access more difficult.

### Cold Storage

A significant portion of users' funds is stored in cold wallets, which are offline and thereby secure from online hacking attempts. This reduces the risk of losing funds through cyber-attacks.

### Anti-Phishing Measures

To combat phishing attacks, Zaif has implemented anti-phishing measures which include sending alerts and warnings to users about suspicious activities or attempts to steal credentials.

## Supported Cryptocurrencies

Zaif supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies, making it a versatile platform for traders. Some of the major supported currencies include:

- Bitcoin (BTC)
- Ethereum (ETH)
- Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
- NEM (XEM)
- MonaCoin (MONA)
- Counterparty (XCP)

## Trading Features

### Spot Trading

Zaif offers spot trading, where traders can instantly buy or sell cryptocurrencies at the current market price. This is the most straightforward form of trading and is suitable for both new and experienced traders.

### Automated Trading

For those interested in algorithmic trading, Zaif supports the use of trading bots. These bots can execute trades based on pre-set rules and conditions, allowing for automated trading strategies that can operate without constant manual intervention.

### API Integrations

Zaif offers API integrations that allow developers to build custom applications and trading tools. The APIs provide access to real-time market data, order execution, and other trading functionalities, making it easier for technical users to optimize their trading strategies.

## Fee Structure

The fee structure at Zaif is competitive, catering to both high-volume traders and smaller participants. Below are some key components of their fee schedule:

- **Trading Fees:** Generally range between 0.1% to 0.5% depending on the trading volume and type of transaction.
- **Deposit Fees:** Zaif does not charge fees for deposits made in cryptocurrencies, but fiat deposits may incur a minimal fee.
- **Withdrawal Fees:** Similar to deposit fees, withdrawal fees are mostly applicable for fiat currencies and vary depending on the withdrawal method.

## Customer Support

Zaif provides multiple support channels including email, live chat, and a comprehensive FAQ section. The customer service team is known for its responsiveness and usually addresses issues or queries in a timely manner.

## Recent Developments

In September 2018, Zaif experienced a significant security breach which resulted in the loss of cryptocurrencies worth around 6.7 billion yen. Following this event, Zaif was acquired by Fisco Digital Asset Group, another Japan-based company specializing in financial services. Since the acquisition, Zaif has bolstered its security measures and continues to operate under enhanced regulatory scrutiny.

## Registration and Verification Process

### Account Creation

Signing up on Zaif involves creating an account by providing an email address and setting a password. This is followed by an email verification step.

### KYC Process

To comply with regulatory requirements, Zaif mandates a Know Your Customer (KYC) process where users need to submit identification documents such as a passport or driver's license. This step is crucial for ensuring the legitimacy of users and preventing unlawful activities such as money laundering.

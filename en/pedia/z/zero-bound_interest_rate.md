# Zero-Bound Interest Rate

## Introduction

In the realm of [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) and central banking, the [zero-bound](../z/zero-bound.md) [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md), often referred to as the [zero lower bound](../z/zero_lower_bound.md) (ZLB), denotes the lowest limit to which [interest](../i/interest.md) rates can usually be lowered by central banks to stimulate [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md). Typically, this lower bound is set at or near [zero percent](../z/zero_percent.md), meaning central banks can no longer effectively reduce [nominal](../n/nominal.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) rates to boost spending and investment. This constraint poses significant challenges for traditional [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md), especially during times of economic [recession](../r/recession.md) or [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md).

## Meaning

The [zero-bound](../z/zero-bound.md) [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) signifies a point at which conventional [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) tools, such as lowering short-term [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, become ineffective. When [interest](../i/interest.md) rates are at or near zero, central banks cannot reduce them further to incentivize lending, consumer spending, and investment. This is mainly due to the inability to pay borrowers to take out loans, and the practical and psychological implications of negative [interest](../i/interest.md) rates for savers and financial institutions.

### Key Concepts

- **[Nominal](../n/nominal.md) vs. Real [Interest](../i/interest.md) Rates**: The [nominal interest rate](../n/nominal_interest_rate.md) is the stated rate without adjustment for [inflation](../i/inflation.md), while the [real interest rate](../r/real_interest_rate.md) is the [nominal](../n/nominal.md) rate adjusted for [inflation](../i/inflation.md).
- **[Liquidity Trap](../l/liquidity_trap.md)**: A situation in which [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) becomes ineffective because individuals hoard cash instead of [investing](../i/investing.md) or spending, even when [interest](../i/interest.md) rates are near zero.
- **Negative [Interest](../i/interest.md) Rates**: A [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) tool where [nominal](../n/nominal.md) target [interest](../i/interest.md) rates are set below [zero percent](../z/zero_percent.md), effectively charging banks for holding deposits with the central [bank](../b/bank.md).

## History

The concept of the [zero-bound](../z/zero-bound.md) [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) has been most prominently observed in the economic policies of major western economies over the past two decades. Following the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) of 2007-2008, many central banks, such as the Federal Reserve (Fed), [Bank](../b/bank.md) of Japan (BOJ), and the European Central [Bank](../b/bank.md) (ECB), encountered the constraints of the ZLB.

### Key Historical Moments

1. **The [Great Depression](../g/great_depression.md) (1930s)**: Central banks struggled with the ZLB, as conventional monetary tools were insufficient to pull economies out of the economic [depression](../d/depression.md).
2. **Japan's [Lost Decade](../l/lost_decade.md) (1990s)**: Japan's prolonged economic [stagnation](../s/stagnation.md) saw the BOJ lowering [interest](../i/interest.md) rates to zero and adopting unconventional monetary policies, like [quantitative easing](../q/quantitative_easing.md) (QE).
3. **Global [Financial Crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) (2007-2008)**: Central banks globally slashed [interest](../i/interest.md) rates to historically low levels, with some adopting ZLB and even negative [interest](../i/interest.md) rates to combat a severe [recession](../r/recession.md).

### Notable Figures and Their Contributions

- **[John Maynard Keynes](../j/john_maynard_keynes.md)**: Introduced the concept of a "[liquidity trap](../l/liquidity_trap.md)" in his seminal work, "The General Theory of Employment, [Interest](../i/interest.md), and [Money](../m/money.md)".
- **[Ben Bernanke](../b/ben_bernanke.md)**: As the Fed Chairman during the 2008 crisis, he oversaw the implementation of unconventional monetary policies, bringing [interest](../i/interest.md) rates near zero and initiating QE programs.

## Crisis Tactics

When traditional policy measures [fail](../f/fail.md), central banks resort to a plethora of alternative tactics to circumvent the issues posed by the ZLB.

### Quantitative Easing (QE)

QE involves the central [bank](../b/bank.md) purchasing long-term securities, such as government and corporate bonds, to inject [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) into the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md). This increases the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md), lowers [interest](../i/interest.md) rates on these bonds, and encourages lending and investment.

- **Example**: The Fed's QE programs post-2008 crisis, where it purchased assets worth trillions of dollars to support the [economy](../e/economy.md). [More details](https://www.federalreserve.gov).

### Forward Guidance

Forward [guidance](../g/guidance.md) is a communicative strategy whereby a central [bank](../b/bank.md) conveys its future policy intentions to influence [market](../m/market.md) expectations and behaviors. By committing to keeping [interest](../i/interest.md) rates low for an extended period, central banks aim to influence long-term [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and economic decisions.

- **Example**: European Central [Bank](../b/bank.md)'s post-crisis language pledging to keep [interest](../i/interest.md) rates low for a prolonged time. [ECB Policies](https://www.ecb.europa.eu).

### Negative Interest Rates

Some central banks have adopted policies where [nominal](../n/nominal.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) rates are set below zero, essentially charging banks for holding [excess reserves](../e/excess_reserves.md) to spur lending.

- **Successes and Limitations**: While this policy helped address deflationary pressures, it also faced criticism for distorting [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and squeezing [bank](../b/bank.md) profits.

- **Example**: The ECB and the [Bank](../b/bank.md) of Japan implemented [negative interest rate](../n/negative_interest_rate.md) policies in the mid-2010s. [Bank of Japan](https://www.boj.or.jp).

### Other Unconventional Tools

- **[Credit](../c/credit.md) Easing**: Focuses on improving [credit](../c/credit.md) conditions specifically by purchasing private-sector assets like [commercial paper](../c/commercial_paper.md) and [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-backed securities.
- **[Yield Curve](../y/yard.md) Control (YCC)**: Aims at controlling not just short-term but also long-term [interest](../i/interest.md) rates by targeting specific yields on government bonds.

## Challenges and Criticisms

The [zero-bound](../z/zero-bound.md) [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) and the [recourse](../r/recourse.md) to unconventional monetary policies present various challenges and criticisms:

### Effectiveness

- **Diminishing Returns**: There's an ongoing debate on the diminishing effectiveness of policies like QE over time.
- **Transmission Mechanism**: The mechanism through which these policies influence the broader [economy](../e/economy.md) can be slow and uncertain.

### Inflation

Prolonged periods near the ZLB can lead to [deflation](../d/deflation.md), which exacerbates economic [stagnation](../s/stagnation.md). Central banks aim to balance this by targeting moderate [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

### Financial Stability

- **[Asset](../a/asset.md) [Bubbles](../b/bubble.md)**: Prolonged low [interest](../i/interest.md) rates can inflate [asset](../a/asset.md) [bubbles](../b/bubble.md), as cheap [credit](../c/credit.md) leads to excessive [risk](../r/risk.md)-taking in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).
- **[Bank](../b/bank.md) Profitability**: Negative [interest](../i/interest.md) rates can squeeze the profitability of banks, affecting their ability to lend and creating risks for financial stability.

### Political and Social Implications

[Monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) is occasionally scrutinized for its political and social impacts, including [income inequality](../i/income_inequality.md) as [asset](../a/asset.md) prices rise due to QE and other expansive monetary policies.

## Conclusion

The [zero-bound](../z/zero-bound.md) [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) presents a significant constraint on traditional [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md), pushing central banks into adopting unconventional and sometimes controversial measures to stimulate economic activity. The history, ranging from the [Great Depression](../g/great_depression.md) to the global [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md), showcases the recurring challenges posed by the ZLB. Through tools like [quantitative easing](../q/quantitative_easing.md), forward [guidance](../g/guidance.md), and negative [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, central banks have attempted to navigate the limitations of the ZLB. However, the effectiveness, economic impact, and broader societal implications of these tactics continue to be a subject of extensive analysis and debate.

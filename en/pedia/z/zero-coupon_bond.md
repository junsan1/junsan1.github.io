# Zero-Coupon Bond

A zero-coupon [bond](../b/bond.md), also known as a [discount bond](../d/discount_bond.md) or deep [discount bond](../d/discount_bond.md), is a type of [bond](../b/bond.md) that does not pay periodic [interest](../i/interest.md) payments, also referred to as coupon payments. Instead, it is issued at a significant [discount](../d/discount.md) to its [face value](../f/face_value.md) (also known as [par value](../p/par_value.md)), and the [bondholder](../b/bondholder.md) receives the [face value](../f/face_value.md) at the time of [maturity](../m/maturity.md). The difference between the purchase price of the [bond](../b/bond.md) and its [face value](../f/face_value.md) represents the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s [return](../r/return.md) from this investment, which effectively is the [interest](../i/interest.md) earned over the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s term.

### Features of Zero-Coupon Bonds

#### Issuance and Structure
Zero-coupon bonds are issued at a [discount](../d/discount.md) to their [face value](../f/face_value.md). For example, an [investor](../i/investor.md) might purchase a zero-coupon [bond](../b/bond.md) for $600, which has a [face value](../f/face_value.md) of $1,000, set to mature in 10 years. At [maturity](../m/maturity.md), the [investor](../i/investor.md) [will](../w/will.md) receive the $1,000 [face value](../f/face_value.md). The $400 difference between the purchase price and the [face value](../f/face_value.md) represents the [interest](../i/interest.md) [income](../i/income.md) that accrues over the life of the [bond](../b/bond.md).

#### Duration and Interest Rate Risk
The [duration](../d/duration.md) of a zero-coupon [bond](../b/bond.md) is equal to its [maturity](../m/maturity.md) because there are no intermediate cash flows before [maturity](../m/maturity.md). This characteristic makes zero-coupon bonds highly sensitive to changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. If [interest](../i/interest.md) rates rise, the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s [face value](../f/face_value.md) (the only [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md)) [will](../w/will.md) decrease significantly, leading to a decline in the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s [market price](../m/market_price.md). Conversely, if [interest](../i/interest.md) rates fall, the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s [market price](../m/market_price.md) [will](../w/will.md) increase.

#### Tax Considerations
In some jurisdictions, zero-coupon bonds are subject to tax on the [imputed interest](../i/imputed_interest.md) that accrues each year, even though the [bondholder](../b/bondholder.md) does not receive any actual [interest](../i/interest.md) payments. This [imputed interest](../i/imputed_interest.md) is the difference between the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s purchase price and its [face value](../f/face_value.md), spread over the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s term. Investors need to be aware of the tax implications when [investing](../i/investing.md) in zero-coupon bonds, as they may have to pay [taxes](../t/taxes.md) annually on [interest](../i/interest.md) that has not yet been received.

### Types of Zero-Coupon Bonds

#### Government Zero-Coupon Bonds
Government-issued zero-coupon bonds, such as U.S. [Treasury STRIPS](../t/treasury_strips.md), are among the most secure types. U.S. [Treasury STRIPS](../t/treasury_strips.md) (Separate Trading of Registered [Interest](../i/interest.md) and [Principal](../p/principal.md) Securities) allow investors to purchase individual [interest](../i/interest.md) or [principal components](../p/principal_components_in_trading.md) of eligible [Treasury notes](../t/treasury_notes.md) and bonds as separate securities. More details can be found on the [U.S. Department of the Treasury website](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/).

#### Corporate Zero-Coupon Bonds
Corporations may [issue](../i/issue.md) zero-coupon bonds to raise [capital](../c/capital.md). These bonds tend to [offer](../o/offer.md) higher yields compared to government bonds, compensating investors for the higher [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md). Given the absence of periodic [interest](../i/interest.md) payments, corporate zero-coupon bonds typically [trade](../t/trade.md) at significant discounts to their face values.

#### Municipal Zero-Coupon Bonds
Municipalities also [issue](../i/issue.md) zero-coupon bonds, often referred to as municipal zeros. The [interest](../i/interest.md) on these bonds is typically exempt from [federal income](../f/federal_income.md) tax and, in some cases, from state and local [taxes](../t/taxes.md). Investors in high [tax brackets](../t/tax_brackets.md) can benefit significantly from the tax-exempt status of these securities.

### Investments Strategies Involving Zero-Coupon Bonds

#### Long-Term Investment
Zero-coupon bonds are suitable for long-term investors who do not need periodic [interest](../i/interest.md) [income](../i/income.md) and are looking for a predictable [return](../r/return.md) at [maturity](../m/maturity.md). The [investment horizon](../i/investment_horizon.md) should align with the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s [maturity date](../m/maturity_date.md) to avoid [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md).

#### Immunization and Duration Matching
Institutions, such as pension funds, often use zero-coupon bonds to immunize their portfolios against [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) risks and to match the [duration](../d/duration.md) of assets and liabilities. Since the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s [duration](../d/duration.md) equals its [maturity](../m/maturity.md), it provides a precise tool for managing [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) exposure.

#### Tax Planning
For investors subject to high tax rates, using tax-exempt municipal zero-coupon bonds can be an effective strategy to maximize after-tax returns. Moreover, timing the [maturity](../m/maturity.md) to coincide with [tax-advantaged](../t/tax-advantaged.md) events or changes in tax rates can optimize tax outcomes.

### Risks and Considerations

#### Interest Rate Risk
Zero-coupon bonds are highly sensitive to changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. A rise in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates can significantly reduce the [bond](../b/bond.md)â€™s [market value](../m/market_value.md), leading to potential [capital](../c/capital.md) losses if the bonds are sold before [maturity](../m/maturity.md).

#### Credit Risk
Investors need to consider the [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) of the [issuer](../i/issuer.md). While government-issued zero-coupon bonds generally pose minimal [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md), corporate and municipal zeros carry more [risk](../r/risk.md), which is reflected in higher yields.

#### Liquidity Risk
Zero-coupon bonds may suffer from lower [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) compared to bonds that pay regular [interest](../i/interest.md). This characteristic can make it challenging to sell the bonds quickly without a significant price concession.

### Calculating the Yield to Maturity (YTM)

Understanding how to calculate the [yield to maturity](../y/yield_to_maturity.md) for a zero-coupon [bond](../b/bond.md) is crucial for evaluating its attractiveness as an investment. The YTM is the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) that equates the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s future [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) (the [face value](../f/face_value.md)) to its current [market price](../m/market_price.md).

The formula for calculating the YTM is:
\[ YTM = \left( \frac{F}{P} \right)^{\frac{1}{n}} - 1 \]

Where:
- \( F \) = [Face value](../f/face_value.md) of the [bond](../b/bond.md)
- \( P \) = Current [market price](../m/market_price.md) of the [bond](../b/bond.md)
- \( n \) = Number of years until [maturity](../m/maturity.md)

For example, if you purchase a zero-coupon [bond](../b/bond.md) for $600 with a [face value](../f/face_value.md) of $1,000 and a [maturity](../m/maturity.md) of 10 years, the YTM would be calculated as follows:
\[ YTM = \left( \frac{1000}{600} \right)^{\frac{1}{10}} - 1 \approx 0.0515 \text{ or } 5.15\% \]

### Conclusion

Zero-coupon bonds [offer](../o/offer.md) a compelling investment opportunity for investors seeking long-term growth and predictability. Their unique structure, which involves no periodic [interest](../i/interest.md) payments and is issued at a [discount](../d/discount.md), allows investors to lock in a fixed [return](../r/return.md) over the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s life. However, these bonds come with risks, particularly [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md) and, in the case of corporate and [municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md), [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md). Investors need to carefully consider their [investment horizon](../i/investment_horizon.md), tax situation, and [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) before [investing](../i/investing.md) in zero-coupon bonds. By understanding the mechanics and implications of zero-coupon bonds, investors can make informed decisions and effectively incorporate these instruments into their investment portfolios.

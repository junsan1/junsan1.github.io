## History

The origins of the ZSE trace back to 1896, making it one of the oldest stock exchanges in Africa. Initially set up to facilitate the trading of [mining](../m/mining.md) [shares](../s/shares.md), it has evolved significantly over the years. The [exchange](../e/exchange.md) went through formal [incorporation](../i/incorporation.md) in 1946, and in 1974, it opened its doors to public trading.

## Structure

### Board of Directors

The governance of the ZSE is overseen by a Board of Directors, which consists of a combination of non-executive and executive members. This body is responsible for strategic oversight, ensuring that the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) adheres to its mission and vision while maintaining regulatory compliance and [operational efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md).

### Committees

The Board operates several specialized committees to manage various aspects of the [exchange](../e/exchange.md). These typically include:

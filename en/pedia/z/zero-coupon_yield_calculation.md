# Zero-Coupon Yield Calculation

Zero-coupon bonds, also known as [discount](../d/discount.md) bonds or deep [discount](../d/discount.md) bonds, are bonds that are issued at a significant [discount](../d/discount.md) from their [face value](../f/face_value.md) and do not pay periodic [interest](../i/interest.md) payments (coupons). Instead, they are redeemed at [face value](../f/face_value.md) at the time of [maturity](../m/maturity.md). The [return](../r/return.md) on zero-coupon bonds is derived from the difference between the purchase price and the [face value](../f/face_value.md), which becomes payable at [maturity](../m/maturity.md).

### Fundamentals of Zero-Coupon Bonds

Unlike standard bonds that pay [interest](../i/interest.md) periodically, zero-coupon bonds pay the [investor](../i/investor.md) the [face value](../f/face_value.md) at [maturity](../m/maturity.md), with no intervening [interest](../i/interest.md) payments. Because there are no periodic [interest](../i/interest.md) payments, the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s entire [return](../r/return.md) is based on the price appreciation between the purchase price and the [face value](../f/face_value.md).

#### Characteristics of Zero-Coupon Bonds
- **Issued at a [Discount](../d/discount.md):** Zero-coupon bonds are sold at a [discount](../d/discount.md) to their face (par) [value](../v/value.md).
- **Single [Payment](../p/payment.md):** The [bond](../b/bond.md) is redeemed at its [face value](../f/face_value.md) at [maturity](../m/maturity.md).
- **No [Reinvestment Risk](../r/reinvestment_risk.md):** Since there are no periodic [interest](../i/interest.md) payments, investors are not faced with [reinvestment risk](../r/reinvestment_risk.md).
- **Priced on [Compounding](../c/compounding.md) [Interest](../i/interest.md):** The price appreciation reflects the effect of [compounding](../c/compounding.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) over time.

### Calculation of Zero-Coupon Yield

The [yield](../y/yield.md) of a [zero-coupon bond](../z/zero-coupon_bond.md), also known as the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s [yield to maturity](../y/yield_to_maturity.md) (YTM), is the internal [rate of return](../r/rate_of_return.md) (IRR) on the investment. It is the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) that equates the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s future [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) (the [face value](../f/face_value.md) at [maturity](../m/maturity.md)) to its current price.

#### Zero-Coupon Yield Formula

The zero-coupon [yield](../y/yield.md) can be calculated using the following formula:
\[ 
YTM = \left( \frac{FV}{PV} \right)^{\frac{1}{n}} - 1 
\]
Where:
- \( YTM \) = [Yield to Maturity](../y/yield_to_maturity.md)
- \( FV \) = [Face Value](../f/face_value.md) of the [bond](../b/bond.md)
- \( PV \) = [Present Value](../p/present_value.md) (purchase price) of the [bond](../b/bond.md)
- \( n \) = Number of years until [maturity](../m/maturity.md)

#### Example Calculation

Assume an [investor](../i/investor.md) purchases a [zero-coupon bond](../z/zero-coupon_bond.md) with a [face value](../f/face_value.md) of $1,000, maturing in 5 years, at a price of $800.

\[ 
YTM = \left( \frac{1000}{800} \right)^{\frac{1}{5}} - 1 
\]

\[ 
YTM = \left( 1.25 \right)^{0.20} - 1 \]

\[ 
YTM = 1.045639 - 1 \]

\[ 
YTM = 0.045639 \text{ or } 4.56\%
\]

Therefore, the [yield to maturity](../y/yield_to_maturity.md) on this [zero-coupon bond](../z/zero-coupon_bond.md) is 4.56%.

### Practical Applications

#### Treasury STRIPS
[Treasury STRIPS](../t/treasury_strips.md) (Separate Trading of Registered [Interest](../i/interest.md) and [Principal](../p/principal.md) Securities) are a type of [zero-coupon bond](../z/zero-coupon_bond.md) issued by the [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md). Investors can purchase individual [interest](../i/interest.md) or [principal components](../p/principal_components_in_trading.md) of Treasury securities as separate securities.

#### Corporate and Municipal Zero-Coupon Bonds

Many corporations and municipalities [issue](../i/issue.md) zero-coupon bonds as part of their funding strategies. These bonds are useful for investors who want to lock in a specific future [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) without the need to manage [interest](../i/interest.md) [reinvestment](../r/reinvestment.md).

### Risks and Considerations

#### Interest Rate Risk
One of the primary risks for zero-coupon bonds is [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md). Since zero-coupon bonds have a [duration](../d/duration.md) equal to their [maturity](../m/maturity.md), their price is highly sensitive to changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. When [interest](../i/interest.md) rates rise, the price of zero-coupon bonds falls significantly, and vice versa.

#### Tax Considerations
Even though zero-coupon bonds do not pay periodic [interest](../i/interest.md), the [accrued interest](../a/accrued_interest.md) (the difference between the purchase price and the [face value](../f/face_value.md)) is taxable as "phantom [income](../i/income.md)" for the [bondholder](../b/bondholder.md) each year before [maturity](../m/maturity.md) in many jurisdictions.

#### Credit Risk
If the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) of the [zero-coupon bond](../z/zero-coupon_bond.md) faces financial difficulties or defaults, the [bondholder](../b/bondholder.md) may not receive the expected [face value](../f/face_value.md) at [maturity](../m/maturity.md). This [risk](../r/risk.md) is particularly relevant for corporate and municipal zero-coupon bonds.

### Conclusion

Zero-coupon bonds [offer](../o/offer.md) a unique set of advantages and risks, providing investors with a predictable, future lump-sum [payout](../p/payout.md) without the need to manage [reinvestment](../r/reinvestment.md) of coupons. [Yield](../y/yield.md) calculation for zero-coupon bonds is straightforward and can help assess the profitability of the investment. However, investors must account for associated risks like [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md) and tax implications.

For more detailed information on zero-coupon bonds, investors can visit reputable financial institutions such as the U.S. Department of the Treasury's website [here](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/).

Zero-coupon bonds remain a vital component of fixed-[income](../i/income.md) portfolios, [offering](../o/offering.md) [diversification](../d/diversification.md) and [inflation](../i/inflation.md) protection when appropriately used in conjunction with other investment strategies.

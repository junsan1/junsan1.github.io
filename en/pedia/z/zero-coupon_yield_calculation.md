## Zero-Coupon Yield Calculation

Zero-coupon bonds, also known as discount bonds or deep discount bonds, are bonds that are issued at a significant discount from their face value and do not pay periodic interest payments (coupons). Instead, they are redeemed at face value at the time of maturity. The return on zero-coupon bonds is derived from the difference between the purchase price and the face value, which becomes payable at maturity.

### Fundamentals of Zero-Coupon Bonds

Unlike standard bonds that pay interest periodically, zero-coupon bonds pay the investor the face value at maturity, with no intervening interest payments. Because there are no periodic interest payments, the bond's entire return is based on the price appreciation between the purchase price and the face value.

#### Characteristics of Zero-Coupon Bonds
- **Issued at a Discount:** Zero-coupon bonds are sold at a discount to their face (par) value.
- **Single Payment:** The bond is redeemed at its face value at maturity.
- **No Reinvestment Risk:** Since there are no periodic interest payments, investors are not faced with reinvestment risk.
- **Priced on Compounding Interest:** The price appreciation reflects the effect of compounding interest over time.

### Calculation of Zero-Coupon Yield

The yield of a [zero-coupon bond](../z/zero-coupon_bond.md), also known as the bond's [yield to maturity](../y/yield_to_maturity.md) (YTM), is the internal rate of return (IRR) on the investment. It is the interest rate that equates the present value of the bond's future cash flow (the face value at maturity) to its current price.

#### Zero-Coupon Yield Formula

The zero-coupon yield can be calculated using the following formula:
\[ 
YTM = \left( \frac{FV}{PV} \right)^{\frac{1}{n}} - 1 
\]
Where:
- \( YTM \) = [Yield to Maturity](../y/yield_to_maturity.md)
- \( FV \) = Face Value of the bond
- \( PV \) = Present Value (purchase price) of the bond
- \( n \) = Number of years until maturity

#### Example Calculation

Assume an investor purchases a [zero-coupon bond](../z/zero-coupon_bond.md) with a face value of $1,000, maturing in 5 years, at a price of $800.

\[ 
YTM = \left( \frac{1000}{800} \right)^{\frac{1}{5}} - 1 
\]

\[ 
YTM = \left( 1.25 \right)^{0.20} - 1 \]

\[ 
YTM = 1.045639 - 1 \]

\[ 
YTM = 0.045639 \text{ or } 4.56\%
\]

Therefore, the [yield to maturity](../y/yield_to_maturity.md) on this [zero-coupon bond](../z/zero-coupon_bond.md) is 4.56%.

### Practical Applications

#### Treasury STRIPS
Treasury STRIPS (Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal Securities) are a type of [zero-coupon bond](../z/zero-coupon_bond.md) issued by the U.S. Treasury. Investors can purchase individual interest or principal components of Treasury securities as separate securities.

#### Corporate and Municipal Zero-Coupon Bonds

Many corporations and municipalities issue zero-coupon bonds as part of their funding strategies. These bonds are useful for investors who want to lock in a specific future cash flow without the need to manage interest reinvestment.

### Risks and Considerations

#### Interest Rate Risk
One of the primary risks for zero-coupon bonds is interest rate risk. Since zero-coupon bonds have a duration equal to their maturity, their price is highly sensitive to changes in interest rates. When interest rates rise, the price of zero-coupon bonds falls significantly, and vice versa.

#### Tax Considerations
Even though zero-coupon bonds do not pay periodic interest, the accrued interest (the difference between the purchase price and the face value) is taxable as "phantom income" for the bondholder each year before maturity in many jurisdictions.

#### Credit Risk
If the issuer of the [zero-coupon bond](../z/zero-coupon_bond.md) faces financial difficulties or defaults, the bondholder may not receive the expected face value at maturity. This risk is particularly relevant for corporate and municipal zero-coupon bonds.

### Conclusion

Zero-coupon bonds offer a unique set of advantages and risks, providing investors with a predictable, future lump-sum payout without the need to manage reinvestment of coupons. Yield calculation for zero-coupon bonds is straightforward and can help assess the profitability of the investment. However, investors must account for associated risks like interest rate risk and tax implications.

Zero-coupon bonds remain a vital component of fixed-income portfolios, offering diversification and inflation protection when appropriately used in conjunction with other investment strategies.

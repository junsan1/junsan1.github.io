# Zero Cost Collar

The zero cost [collar](../c/collar.md), also known as a costless [collar](../c/collar.md) or zero-cost [options](../o/options.md) strategy, is a type of [options](../o/options.md) [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) employed to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against potential losses without incurring any initial [premium](../p/premium.md) cost. This is achieved by simultaneously purchasing a [protective put](../p/protective_put.md) option and selling a [covered call](../c/covered_call.md) option on the same [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). The premiums received from selling the [call option](../c/call_option.md) [offset](../o/offset.md) the cost of purchasing the [put option](../p/put.md), thus creating a "zero cost" arrangement for the [trader](../t/trader.md). 

## Overview

A zero cost [collar](../c/collar.md) is typically used by investors to lock in a desired [range](../r/range.md) of potential returns while protecting against substantial [downside risk](../d/downside_risk.md). This strategy is particularly popular among [equity](../e/equity.md) investors who seek to protect their investments from [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) while maintaining some [upside potential](../u/upside_potential_in_trading.md).

The key aspects of a zero-cost [collar](../c/collar.md) are:

1. **[Protective Put](../p/protective_put.md) Option**: This is a [put option](../p/put.md) purchased by the [investor](../i/investor.md). It gives the [investor](../i/investor.md) the right, but not the obligation, to sell the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at a predetermined price (the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md)) before the option expires. The [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of this put is typically set below the current [market price](../m/market_price.md) of the [asset](../a/asset.md) to provide a safety net against significant losses.

2. **[Covered Call](../c/covered_call.md) Option**: This is a [call option](../c/call_option.md) sold by the [investor](../i/investor.md). It gives the buyer of the option the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at a predetermined price (the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md)) before the option expires. Selling this option generates a [premium](../p/premium.md) that can [offset](../o/offset.md) the cost of buying the [protective put](../p/protective_put.md).

The combination of these two [options](../o/options.md) provides a [range](../r/range.md) of potential outcomes for the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), with the goal of minimizing the cost of hedging.

## Mechanism of a Zero Cost Collar

To illustrate how a zero cost [collar](../c/collar.md) works, let's consider an example involving a stock currently trading at $100 per share. An [investor](../i/investor.md) wants to protect their investment from significant losses over the next 6 months while also being willing to cap their potential gains.

1. **[Protective Put](../p/protective_put.md)**: The [investor](../i/investor.md) buys a 6-month [put option](../p/put.md) with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $90. This option costs $3 per share.
2. **[Covered Call](../c/covered_call.md)**: The [investor](../i/investor.md) sells a 6-month [call option](../c/call_option.md) with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $110. This option generates a [premium](../p/premium.md) of $3 per share.

In this scenario, the cost of purchasing the [put option](../p/put.md) is completely [offset](../o/offset.md) by the [premium](../p/premium.md) received from selling the [call option](../c/call_option.md), resulting in a zero net cost for the [hedge](../h/hedge.md).

### Payoff Structure

The payoff structure of a zero cost [collar](../c/collar.md) can be described as follows:

- **If the stock price falls below $90**: The [put option](../p/put.md) comes into effect, allowing the [investor](../i/investor.md) to sell the stock at $90, thus limiting the [downside risk](../d/downside_risk.md).
- **If the stock price rises above $110**: The [call option](../c/call_option.md) comes into effect, obligating the [investor](../i/investor.md) to sell the stock at $110, thus capping the [upside potential](../u/upside_potential_in_trading.md).
- **If the stock price remains between $90 and $110**: Both [options](../o/options.md) expire worthless, and the [investor](../i/investor.md) retains their original stock position.

This structure ensures that the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s potential losses are limited while also capping the potential gains.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

1. **Cost-Effective Hedging**: As the name suggests, zero cost collars are designed to provide hedging without initial [premium](../p/premium.md) cost, making them an attractive option for cost-conscious investors.
2. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: The [protective put](../p/protective_put.md) option limits [downside risk](../d/downside_risk.md), providing a safety net against significant losses.
3. **Simplicity**: This strategy is relatively simple to implement and understand compared to other more complex [options](../o/options.md) strategies.
4. **Flexibility**: Investors can customize the strike prices and expiration dates of the [options](../o/options.md) to suit their specific [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) and investment goals.

### Disadvantages

1. **Capped [Upside Potential](../u/upside_potential_in_trading.md)**: The [covered call](../c/covered_call.md) option limits the potential gains an [investor](../i/investor.md) can achieve if the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price rises significantly.
2. **[Opportunity Cost](../o/opportunity_cost.md)**: By capping the [upside potential](../u/upside_potential_in_trading.md), investors may miss out on substantial gains if the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s price increases beyond the [call option](../c/call_option.md)'s [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).
3. **Complexity in [Execution](../e/execution.md)**: While the concept is simple, executing the strategy requires careful selection of strike prices and expiration dates to achieve the desired [hedge](../h/hedge.md).
4. **[Margin](../m/margin.md) Requirements**: Selling [covered call](../c/covered_call.md) [options](../o/options.md) may require maintaining a [margin account](../m/margin_account.md), which can involve additional regulatory requirements and risks.

## Applications of Zero Cost Collars

Zero cost collars are used by various types of investors and institutions for different purposes:

1. **[Equity](../e/equity.md) Investors**: Individual investors and portfolio managers use zero cost collars to protect their stock investments from significant [downside risk](../d/downside_risk.md) while maintaining some [upside potential](../u/upside_potential_in_trading.md).
2. **Institutional Investors**: Pension funds, [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies, and other institutional investors use zero cost collars to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) their large [equity](../e/equity.md) [holdings](../h/holdings.md) against [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md).
3. **[Corporate Finance](../c/corporate_finance.md)**: Companies may use zero cost collars to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against [currency](../c/currency.md) [risk](../r/risk.md), [commodity](../c/commodity.md) price fluctuations, or [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) changes that could impact their [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md).
4. **[Portfolio Management](../p/par.md)**: Portfolio managers may employ this strategy as part of their overall [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) and [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) to achieve specific [return](../r/return.md) objectives while mitigating [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Real-World Example

A notable example of a company utilizing zero-cost collars is Microsoft [Corporation](../c/corporation.md). During the 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md), Microsoft employed a zero cost [collar](../c/collar.md) strategy to protect its [equity](../e/equity.md) investments from [market](../m/market.md) downturns. By using this strategy, Microsoft was able to mitigate the impact of [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) on its investment portfolio without incurring significant hedging costs.

## Conclusion

The zero cost [collar](../c/collar.md) is a versatile and cost-effective [options](../o/options.md) strategy that enables investors to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against [downside risk](../d/downside_risk.md) while maintaining some [upside potential](../u/upside_potential_in_trading.md). By combining a [protective put](../p/protective_put.md) option with a [covered call](../c/covered_call.md) option, investors can lock in a desired [range](../r/range.md) of potential returns without incurring initial [premium](../p/premium.md) costs. While this strategy has its advantages, such as cost-effectiveness and simplicity, it also comes with limitations, including capped [upside potential](../u/upside_potential_in_trading.md) and opportunity costs. Overall, zero cost collars are a valuable tool for managing [risk](../r/risk.md) and achieving specific investment objectives in a dynamic [market](../m/market.md) environment.

# Zakat

Zakat, one of the Five Pillars of Islam, is a religious obligation for all Muslims who meet the necessary criteria of [wealth](../w/wealth.md). It is a form of almsgiving treated in Islam as a religious obligation or tax, which, by Quranic ranking, is next after prayer (salat) in importance. The practice of Zakat is a means of purifying one's [income](../i/income.md) and [wealth](../w/wealth.md) by giving a portion of it to those in need. It is distinct from voluntary charity or sadaqah, meaning Zakat is considered an obligatory act of devotion.

### Definition and Principles

The term "Zakat" literally means "to cleanse" or "to purify." The name reflects the purifying impact that it has on the donor's [wealth](../w/wealth.md) and soul. Zakat is not merely a charitable contribution, but a specific, calculated amount based on one's [wealth](../w/wealth.md) that must be distributed to designated recipients.

### Calculation and Applicable Wealth (Nisab)

Zakat is calculated at a rate of 2.5% of a Muslim's total savings and [wealth](../w/wealth.md) that has been in possession for over a lunar year (hawl). The [wealth](../w/wealth.md) types subject to Zakat include gold, silver, cash, and [stocks](../s/stock.md), as well as other types of monetary investments and savings. The minimum amount of [wealth](../w/wealth.md) on which Zakat is payable is termed "Nisab." This threshold is set at the [value](../v/value.md) of 87.48 grams of gold or 612.36 grams of silver.

### Who Should Pay Zakat?

Any Muslim who owns [wealth](../w/wealth.md) above the Nisab threshold and has possessed it for at least one lunar year is obligated to pay Zakat. Zakat is applicable on [multiple](../m/multiple.md) types of assets, including:
- Cash or [liquid](../l/liquid.md) assets;
- Gold and silver;
- [Stocks](../s/stock.md) and investment portfolios;
- [Business](../b/business.md) merchandise;
- Agricultural produce, livestock.

### Zakat Al-Fitr

Distinct from Zakat is Zakat al-Fitr, a mandatory act of charity required of every Muslim at the end of Ramadan. It is often paid in the form of staple food items or their monetary equivalent and is intended to purify those who fast from any indecent act or speech and to help the poor and needy.

### Recipients of Zakat

The Quran (Surah Al-Tawba, 9:60) specifies eight categories of recipients eligible for Zakat:
1. The Poor (Fuqara);
2. The Needy (Masakin);
3. Zakat administrators;
4. Those whose hearts are to be reconciled (new Muslims or friends of the Muslim community);
5. Those in bondage (captives or slaves, for their release);
6. The [debt](../d/debt.md)-ridden (those who have incurred overwhelming debts while attempting to meet their basic, lawful expenditures);
7. In the cause of Allah (Fi Sabilillah, for promoting the Islamic faith);
8. The Wayfarer (traveler in need).

### The Role of Zakat in the Economy

Zakat plays a pivotal role in the redistribution of [wealth](../w/wealth.md) within the Muslim community, aiming to reduce [poverty](../p/poverty.md) and inequality. By mandating a fixed percentage of [wealth](../w/wealth.md) be given to those in need, it ensures a continuous flow of resources within the community.

### Modern Zakat Collection and Management

In recent decades, several organizations and state departments have been set up to manage the collection and [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of Zakat funds. These bodies often facilitate online calculation and [payment](../p/payment.md) methods to streamline the process. For instance, in countries like Malaysia and Pakistan, Zakat departments within the government manage the collection and equitable redistribution. 

Examples of modern Zakat bodies include:
- National Zakat Foundation in the UK (https://nzf.org.uk/)
- Zakat Foundation of America (https://www.zakat.org/)

### Impact on Financial Planning

For practicing Muslims, Zakat [payment](../p/payment.md) is an essential component of [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md). It requires Muslims to be aware of their financial situation and act in accordance with Islamic principles regarding [wealth management](../w/wealth_management.md). Therefore, it integrates religious duty with financial stewardship and ethical [wealth](../w/wealth.md) [distribution](../d/distribution.md).

### Zakat in Contemporary Financial Instruments

The principles of Zakat have also extended to contemporary financial instruments and fintech. Institutions like Islamic banks incorporate Zakat compliance in their operations, ensuring that the funds they manage adhere to Zakat regulations. Investment portfolios are designed to facilitate easy calculation and [deduction](../d/deduction.md) of Zakat, ensuring that investors comply with their religious [obligations](../o/obligation.md).

### Algorithmic Trading and Zakat

With the rise of [algorithmic trading in financial markets](../a/austerity.md), fintech companies have started to integrate Zakat calculation into their platforms. These algorithms can annually calculate the Zakat due on an individualâ€™s financial [holdings](../h/holdings.md), including [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, and other securities, [offering](../o/offering.md) an easy solution for Muslim investors who [trade](../t/trade.md) extensively.

### Conclusion

Zakat is a cornerstone of Islamic financial ethics, mandating the wealthy to support the less fortunate and promoting a more equitable [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of [wealth](../w/wealth.md). It intertwines religious duty with economic activity, ensuring that personal [wealth](../w/wealth.md) is purified annually and benefiting the broader community. The modernization of Zakat collection and the integration of its principles into contemporary financial instruments reflect its lasting significance and adaptability in a rapidly evolving economic landscape.

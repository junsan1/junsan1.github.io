# Zero Growth Model

## Introduction
The Zero Growth Model is a straight-forward valuation method used in finance, particularly in dividend discount models (DDMs) for valuing a company's stock. It assumes that dividends remain at a constant level indefinitely, meaning the company experiences zero growth over time. This model is best suited for companies with stable earnings and minimal growth prospects, such as utilities or mature firms.

## Basic Formula
The Zero Growth Model simplifies the valuation process through a formula derived from the perpetuity concept. The formula is as follows:

\[ P_0 = \frac{D}{r} \]

Where:
- \( P_0 \) = Price of the stock today
- \( D \) = Expected dividend per share next year
- \( r \) = Required rate of return (discount rate)

This formula essentially calculates the present value of a perpetuity, where the perpetuity is the stream of dividends that will continue to be paid indefinitely without any growth.

## Assumptions
The Zero Growth Model relies on a set of key assumptions:
1. **Constant Dividends**: The dividend payments remain constant and don't grow over time.
2. **Infinite Time Horizon**: The company is expected to continue operating indefinitely, paying the same dividend.
3. **Constant Required Rate of Return**: The rate of return required by investors does not change.
4. **Stable Economic Environment**: There are no economic shocks that could affect the company's ability to pay dividends.

## Application in Valuation
To value a stock using the Zero Growth Model, you need to determine the expected dividend and the required rate of return:
1. **Expected Dividend (D)**: This is usually derived from the company's historical dividend payments.
2. **Required Rate of Return (r)**: This can be estimated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which considers the risk-free rate, the stock’s beta, and the equity market premium.

## Example
Suppose XYZ Corporation pays an annual dividend of $5 per share, and you require a 10% return on your investment. Applying the Zero Growth Model:

\[ P_0 = \frac{5}{0.10} = $50 \]

Thus, the value of XYZ Corporation's stock, assuming zero growth in dividends, is $50 per share.

## Limitations
While the Zero Growth Model offers simplicity, it carries several limitations:
1. **Inapplicability to [Growth Stocks](../g/growth_stocks.md)**: The model is unsuitable for companies expected to grow their dividends.
2. **[Interest Rate Sensitivity](../i/interest_rate_sensitivity.md)**: The model is highly sensitive to changes in the required rate of return.
3. **Assumption of Perpetuity**: The assumption that a company will exist indefinitely may not hold true in a volatile economy.

## Comparison with Other Models
The Zero Growth Model is often compared with the Constant Growth Model (Gordon Growth Model) and the Two-Stage Dividend Discount Model:
1. **Constant Growth Model**: Assumes dividends grow at a constant rate. Suitable for mature companies with predictable growth.
2. **Two-Stage Model**: Accounts for an initial period of high growth followed by stable growth. Useful for young, high-growth companies transitioning to stability.

## Real-World Example
Consider a utility company like Consolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison). Such companies often exhibit stable earnings and dividends:

Suppose Con Edison pays an annual dividend of $3 per share, and investors require a 5% return. Using the Zero Growth Model, the valuation would be:

\[ P_0 = \frac{3}{0.05} = $60 \]

Therefore, Con Edison’s stock would be valued at $60 per share based on the assumption of zero growth in dividends.

## Conclusion
The Zero Growth Model serves as a fundamental tool for valuing stocks with minimal growth prospects. While its simplicity can be an advantage, investors must be wary of its assumptions and limitations, making it essential to apply this model only to appropriate scenarios. For stocks with expected growth, other [valuation models](../v/valuation_models.md) should be considered to capture the growth potential accurately.

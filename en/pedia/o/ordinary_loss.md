# Ordinary Loss

An ordinary loss refers to a financial loss that is not treated as a [capital](../c/capital.md) loss for tax purposes. Unlike [capital](../c/capital.md) losses, which can only be used to [offset](../o/offset.md) [capital](../c/capital.md) gains, ordinary losses can [offset](../o/offset.md) both [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md) (such as wages, salaries, and [business](../b/business.md) [income](../i/income.md)) and [capital](../c/capital.md) gains. This type of loss is particularly relevant to individual taxpayers, small [business](../b/business.md) owners, entrepreneurs, and investors as it can provide significant [tax relief](../t/tax_relief.md). Understanding ordinary losses is essential for proper [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md) and tax strategy.

## Types of Ordinary Losses

Ordinary losses can arise from various sources and activities, notably including:

### 1. **Business Losses**

  - **Operating Losses:** These occur when a company's expenses exceed its [income](../i/income.md) during a tax year. They can stem from lower than expected sales, rising costs, or unexpected expenses. For instance, a restaurant that fails to attract enough customers and consequently spends more on operational costs than it earns would record an operating loss.
  
  - **Bad Debts:** If a [business](../b/business.md) is unable to collect payments owed for goods or services, it can write off these bad debts as ordinary losses. This typically applies to accrual [basis](../b/basis.md) taxpayers who recognize [income](../i/income.md) when a [sale](../s/sale.md) is made rather than when it is collected.
  
  - **Casualty and Theft Losses:** Losses resulting from natural disasters like hurricanes, fires, or theft of [business](../b/business.md) property can be categorized as ordinary losses. The costs involved in repairing or replacing the property plus any lost [revenue](../r/revenue.md) during downtime are deductible.
  
### 2. **Losses from Real Estate Activities**

  - **Rental Property Losses:** When an [investor](../i/investor.md)'s rental [income](../i/income.md) is less than the related expenses ([mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [interest](../i/interest.md), property [taxes](../t/taxes.md), repairs), the resulting loss is considered an ordinary loss. Under certain conditions, up to $25,000 of rental [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) losses can be deducted against other [income](../i/income.md).
  
  - **[Foreclosure](../f/foreclosure.md) and Abandonment:** If a property is foreclosed upon or abandoned by the owner, the loss incurred is usually treated as an ordinary loss.

### 3. **Investment-Related Losses**

  - **Section 1244 Stock:** Losses realized from selling Section 1244 stock—stock in a small, [domestic corporation](../d/domestic_corporation.md) that meets specific criteria—are considered ordinary losses. These can be deducted against [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md) up to $50,000 ($100,000 for [joint](../j/joint.md) returns) annually.

  - **[Worthless Securities](../w/worthless_securities.md):** If securities, such as [stocks](../s/stock.md) or bonds, become completely worthless, the loss can sometimes be treated as an ordinary loss. This typically applies to [business](../b/business.md) owners and some investors in certain conditions.

### 4. **Employee Business Expenses**

  - **Unreimbursed Employee Expenses:** Certain unreimbursed expenses that employees incur in the course of doing their job, such as travel or supplies, can sometimes be claimed as ordinary losses.

## Tax Treatment and Deductions

The primary benefit of ordinary losses is their ability to [offset](../o/offset.md) [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md), potentially leading to substantial tax savings. Here are some details on how these losses can be utilized:

### 1. **Net Operating Loss (NOL)**

An NOL occurs when a [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md)’s allowable deductions exceed their [gross income](../g/gross_income.md). NOLs can typically be carried forward to future tax years, enabling the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) to use the loss to reduce [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md) in those years. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the carryover [deduction](../d/deduction.md) is generally limited to 80% of the [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md) for the year it’s being applied, although exceptions can apply.

### 2. **Deductions**

Ordinary loss deductions are primarily reported on Schedule C (for sole proprietors) or Schedule E (for [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) investments) of the IRS Form 1040.

- **[Business](../b/business.md) Losses:** Report operating losses on Schedule C.
  
- **[Real Estate](../r/real_estate.md) Losses:** Report rental property losses on Schedule E. A special allowance of up to $25,000 can be deducted against other [income](../i/income.md) under the "active participation" rule.
  
- **Investment Losses:** Section 1244 losses are reported directly on Form 1040.

### 3. **Limitation Rules**

While ordinary losses [offer](../o/offer.md) favorable tax treatment, several limitations apply:

- **At-[Risk](../r/risk.md) Limits:** Deductions are limited to the amount the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) has "at [risk](../r/risk.md)" in the [business](../b/business.md). This generally includes cash, property contributions, and borrowed amounts where the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) is personally liable.
  
- **[Passive Activity Loss Rules](../p/passive_activity_loss_rules.md):** These govern the ability to deduct losses from passive activities, such as rental properties or businesses in which the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) does not materially participate. Losses can only be deducted against [passive income](../p/passive_income.md).

## Practical Example

Consider a small tech [startup](../s/startup.md) facing high research and development costs while its products are not yet generating substantial [revenue](../r/revenue.md). For the first few years, the [startup](../s/startup.md) operates at a loss. These losses are ordinary losses and can be used to [offset](../o/offset.md) other [income](../i/income.md) the entrepreneurs might have, such as wages from other employment or spousal [income](../i/income.md).

Similarly, a property [investor](../i/investor.md) who suffers a large enough loss on a rental property due to high maintenance costs and low rental rates can claim these as ordinary losses, subject to the $25,000 limit if they actively participate in the management.

## Strategic Implications

Getting a [handle](../h/handle.md) on ordinary versus [capital](../c/capital.md) losses and understanding the tax rules around them can guide [business](../b/business.md) decisions involving investments, [loan](../l/loan.md) structuring, and [asset management](../a/asset_management.md). Avoiding pitfalls and optimizing the timing and nature of losses help in maximizing tax benefits.

For instance, [restructuring](../r/restructuring.md) [business](../b/business.md) [debt](../d/debt.md) or adjusting the timing of significant purchases and sales can affect the type and timing of recognized losses. Another crucial aspect is rigorous record-keeping and [financial forecasting](../f/financial_forecasting.md) to take full advantage of available tax deductions.

## Financial Tools and Software

Tools like tax preparation software and financial management platforms can assist in calculating and reporting ordinary losses accurately. Popular platforms include:

- **TurboxTax** (TurboTax.com)
  
- **H&R Block** (HRBlock.com)

These programs typically [offer](../o/offer.md) [guidance](../g/guidance.md) on how to input, categorize, and manage various types of ordinary losses, ensuring compliance with relevant tax laws and maximizing potential deductions.

## Professional Advice

Seeking advice from tax professionals or certified public accountants (CPAs) is often prudent, particularly for complex tax situations involving significant ordinary losses. Many [accounting](../a/accounting.md) firms [offer](../o/offer.md) services specializing in loss management strategies, including:

- **Deloitte** (Deloitte.com)
  
- **PwC** (PwC.com)

# One Percent Rule

The One Percent Rule is a fundamental guideline widely embraced in the fields of trading, [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) investment, and [personal finance](../p/personal_finance_in_trading.md) management. Its primary premise is to limit [risk](../r/risk.md) by ensuring that one's potential loss on a single investment does not exceed a specific percentage of their total [capital](../c/capital.md). Although its name implies a strict 1% limit, the exact figure can vary depending on the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md), [market](../m/market.md) conditions, and [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md). This rule, with its variants, is designed to safeguard [capital](../c/capital.md), manage [risk](../r/risk.md), and promote disciplined [investing](../i/investing.md) practices.

## One Percent Rule in Trading

In trading, the One Percent Rule (also known as the 1% [Risk](../r/risk.md) Rule) dictates that a [trader](../t/trader.md) should not [risk](../r/risk.md) more than 1% of their total [trading account](../t/trading_account.md) on a single [trade](../t/trade.md). This management tactic is aimed at protecting the [trader](../t/trader.md) from severe losses, particularly in volatile markets. Here’s how it works in practice:

### Implementation

1. **Determine Total Trading [Capital](../c/capital.md)**: Calculate the total amount of [capital](../c/capital.md) available in the [trading account](../t/trading_account.md). For example, if a [trader](../t/trader.md) has $50,000 in their account, 1% would be $500.
2. **Calculate Position Size**: Based on the stop loss level, the position size is adjusted to ensure that the maximum possible loss does not exceed 1% of the trading [capital](../c/capital.md). For instance, if the desired stop loss is 10 points and the [value](../v/value.md) per point is $5, the [trader](../t/trader.md) should only take a position size of $500/10/$5 = 10 units.
3. **Set [Stop-Loss Orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md)**: Establish [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md) that automatically close positions if the [market](../m/market.md) moves against the [trade](../t/trade.md) by a predetermined amount, limiting potential losses to the 1% threshold.

### Advantages
- **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Helps to manage [risk](../r/risk.md) by preventing excessive losses on any single [trade](../t/trade.md).
- **Emotional Stability**: Reduces emotional decision-making by enforcing a disciplined approach to losses.
- **Long-term Viability**: Ensures that a series of losing trades [will](../w/will.md) not deplete the [trading account](../t/trading_account.md) rapidly.

### Criticism
- **Limitations in Volatile Markets**: May force premature exits in highly volatile markets, where fluctuations might initially go against the [trade](../t/trade.md) before reversing in the desired direction.
- **[Opportunity Cost](../o/opportunity_cost.md)**: Being overly stringent might limit potential gains if traders exit positions too soon.

## One Percent Rule in Real Estate

In the world of [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) [investing](../i/investing.md), the One Percent Rule is a heuristic used to quickly evaluate the potential [return](../r/return.md) on investment (ROI) of a rental property. According to this rule, the monthly rental [income](../i/income.md) should be at least 1% of the property’s purchase price. For example, a property priced at $200,000 should generate at least $2,000 in monthly rent.

### Application

1. **Property Evaluation**: Investors use the One Percent Rule to filter and evaluate properties. If a property meets the 1% threshold, it gets further consideration; otherwise, it might be ignored.
2. **Comparison Tool**: The rule serves as a quick comparison tool among several potential investment properties, allowing investors to focus on those with the most promising [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) potential.
3. **Estimation of [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md)**: Helps in estimating the [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) and [return](../r/return.md) on investment without delving deep into detailed [financial modeling](../f/financial_modeling.md).

### Benefits
- **Simplicity**: Provides a straightforward and easily applicable metric for initial property [appraisal](../a/appraisal.md).
- **[Income](../i/income.md) Assessment**: Assists in assessing whether a property has the potential to generate sufficient [income](../i/income.md) to cover expenses and [yield](../y/yield.md) a [profit](../p/profit.md).

### Limitations
- **[Market](../m/market.md) Variations**: Does not account for variations in [market](../m/market.md) conditions, property conditions, maintenance costs, [taxes](../t/taxes.md), and other financial factors.
- **Oversimplification**: Could oversimplify the [investment analysis](../i/investment_analysis.md) process, leading investors to miss out on potentially profitable properties that do not meet the 1% criteria but have other advantages.

## One Percent Rule in Personal Finance

The One Percent Rule can also be applied to [personal finance](../p/personal_finance_in_trading.md), particularly in savings and [debt](../d/debt.md) management. By dedicating at least 1% of [income](../i/income.md) towards savings or [debt](../d/debt.md) [repayment](../r/repayment.md), individuals can build financial [security](../s/security.md) and stability over time.

### Personal Finance Strategies

1. **Savings Increment**: Individuals can gradually increase the percentage of their [income](../i/income.md) dedicated to savings, starting with 1% and aiming for higher contributions as financial conditions allow.
2. **[Debt](../d/debt.md) Reduction**: By allocating at least 1% of [income](../i/income.md) each month specifically towards reducing [debt](../d/debt.md), individuals can systematically decrease [debt](../d/debt.md) burden over time.
3. **Automatic Transfers**: Setting up automatic transfers of 1% of [income](../i/income.md) into savings or [debt](../d/debt.md) [payment](../p/payment.md) accounts ensures consistency and promotes financial discipline.

### Benefits
- **Habit Formation**: Encourages the formation of good financial habits through consistent savings and [debt](../d/debt.md) [repayment](../r/repayment.md).
- **Financial Growth**: Even a small percentage contributes to significant financial growth and [debt](../d/debt.md) reduction over time.
- **[Budget](../b/budget.md) Discipline**: Helps individuals adhere to a structured [budget](../b/budget.md), improving overall [financial health](../f/financial_health.md).

### Drawbacks
- **Minimal Impact**: A 1% allocation might have a minimal impact, particularly for individuals with high [debt](../d/debt.md) or low [income](../i/income.md), necessitating higher percentages for substantial progress.
- **Dependency on [Income](../i/income.md) Stability**: Effectiveness is contingent on stable, consistent [income](../i/income.md), which might not be realistic for everyone.

## Adaptations and Variants

Various adaptations of the One Percent Rule exist to cater to different investment environments and individual preferences. These variants often involve adjustments to the percentage based on [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md), investment objectives, and [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md).

### Five Percent Rule

Some investors adopt a broader approach with the Five Percent Rule, which suggests that no more than 5% of one's total [capital](../c/capital.md) should be allocated to a single investment. This broader [diversification](../d/diversification.md) reduces the [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with any singular [asset](../a/asset.md) underperforming or failing.

### Custom Percentages

Experienced traders and investors may customize the percentage based on their [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) framework. They might choose to [risk](../r/risk.md) 2%, 3%, or even more of their [capital](../c/capital.md) per investment/[trade](../t/trade.md), depending on their strategy, [market](../m/market.md) conditions, and [risk assessment models](../r/risk_assessment_models.md).

## Conclusion

The One Percent Rule serves as a foundational principle across various domains within trading, [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), and [personal finance](../p/personal_finance_in_trading.md). It promotes disciplined [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), aids in initial investment evaluation, and fosters good financial habits. However, its applicability and effectiveness can vary based on individual circumstances, [market](../m/market.md) conditions, and specific investment strategies. Understanding its potentials and limitations allows investors and individuals to tailor this rule to better suit their specific needs and financial goals.

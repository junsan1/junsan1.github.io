# Order Splitting Strategies in Algorithmic Trading

Order splitting strategies are critical techniques in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), designed to minimize market impact and optimize trade execution. When traders execute large orders, they can significantly affect the market price. By breaking these large orders into smaller ones, the impact on the market can be mitigated, leading to better execution prices and reduced slippage.

## Introduction to Order Splitting

### What is Order Splitting?

Order splitting refers to the process of dividing a large trade order into multiple smaller orders and executing them over a set period or at different price points. This technique aims to reduce the visibility of the trade and minimize the market impact, which can otherwise move prices unfavorably against the trader.

### Why Use Order Splitting?

1. **Minimize Market Impact**: Large orders can shift market prices due to supply and demand imbalances. By splitting the order, the impact is spread over time, reducing price distortions.
2. **Reduce Slippage**: Slippage occurs when there is a difference between the expected price of a trade and the actual price. Smaller orders help to achieve better matching of expected and executed prices.
3. **Improve Execution Quality**: By using advanced algorithms to split and time trades, traders can potentially secure more favorable conditions for each segment of the order.

## Types of Order Splitting Strategies

### 1. Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)

#### Definition

VWAP is a trading benchmark that calculates the average price a security has traded at throughout the day, based on both volume and price. 

#### Strategy

An order is split into several smaller orders based on the historical volume pattern of the security. Orders are placed to reflect the proportion of trading volume at different times of the day.

#### Benefits

- Ensures that trades converge towards the average market price.
- Reduces the risk of significant price deviations.

#### Drawbacks

- Less effective in highly volatile markets.
- Not suitable for securities with irregular trading volumes.

### 2. Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP)

#### Definition

TWAP calculates the average price of a security over a specified time period. This strategy is time-based, irrespective of the trading volume.

#### Strategy

An order is divided into equal-sized smaller orders to be executed at regular intervals over a specified duration.

#### Benefits

- Simple and predictable execution pattern.
- Reduces the risk of concentrating trades in a specific time period.

#### Drawbacks

- May not perform well in markets with significant price movements.
- Ignores trading volume, which might lead to poor execution in low-liquidity periods.

### 3. Implementation Shortfall (IS)

#### Definition

Implementation Shortfall measures the difference between the decision price and the final execution price, aiming to minimize this gap.

#### Strategy

Orders are split and strategically executed to minimize the overall cost of trading, considering market conditions and urgency.

#### Benefits

- Focuses on reducing the total cost of execution.
- Can adapt to real-time market conditions.

#### Drawbacks

- Complexity in implementation.
- Requires sophisticated analytics and real-time decision-making.

### 4. Percent of Volume (POV)

#### Definition

POV strategies align the execution of an order with a predetermined percentage of market volume.

#### Strategy

Orders are split in proportion to the trading volume of the security. For example, if the trader aims to be 10% of the trading volume, orders will be scaled accordingly throughout the day.

#### Benefits

- Matches with the market's liquidity.
- Reduces market impact.

#### Drawbacks

- May not be suitable for urgent trades.
- Complex to predict exact execution timelines.

### 5. Market on Close (MOC)

#### Definition

MOC strategies involve executing trades at the closing price of the trading day.

#### Strategy

The order is split throughout the day with the accumulated volume executed at the closing price.

#### Benefits

- Capitalizes on the end-of-day price, which is less volatile.
- Suitable for less liquid securities.

#### Drawbacks

- Execution relies heavily on the closing auction.
- Risk of significant price movements towards the close.

## Advanced Order Splitting Techniques

### 1. Adaptive Algorithms

[Adaptive algorithms](../a/adaptive_algorithms.md) dynamically adjust the order execution strategy based on real-time market conditions. This involves sophisticated machine learning models that can predict price movements and liquidity availability.

#### Benefits

- Highly responsive to market changes.
- Potentially better execution by leveraging data patterns.

#### Drawbacks

- Requires extensive computational resources.
- Complexity in development and maintenance.

### 2. Dark Pool Execution

[Dark pools](../d/dark_pools.md) are private exchanges for trading securities that are not available to the public. These platforms allow for anonymous trading, minimizing market impact.

#### Benefits

- Reduces the visibility of large orders.
- Can achieve better execution prices without affecting the public market.

#### Drawbacks

- Lack of transparency.
- Potential regulatory concerns.

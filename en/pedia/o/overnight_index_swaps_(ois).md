# Overnight Index Swap

An Overnight [Index](../i/index.md) [Swap](../s/swap.md) (OIS) is a type of [interest rate swap](../i/interest_rate_swap.md) where the periodic floating [payment](../p/payment.md) is based on a [return](../r/return.md) calculated from a daily [compound interest](../c/compound_interest_in_trading.md) investment. This investment typically uses an [overnight rate](../o/overnight_rate.md), which is a measure of the cost of borrowing in the short-term [interbank market](../i/interbank_market.md). OIS are widely used in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) for hedging and as a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for weights and [spreads](../s/spreads.md) between different types of financial instruments.

### Key Concepts and Terminology

1. **[Overnight Rate](../o/overnight_rate.md)**:
   The [overnight rate](../o/overnight_rate.md) is the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) at which a [bank](../b/bank.md) lends to another [bank](../b/bank.md) overnight. Central banks, such as the Federal Reserve in the United States, set [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) overnight rates, which influence all other [interest](../i/interest.md) rates in the [economy](../e/economy.md). For instance, in the U.S., the Fed Funds Rate is the typical [overnight rate](../o/overnight_rate.md) used for OIS.

2. **Floating Rate**:
   In an OIS, the floating rate is tied to the [overnight rate](../o/overnight_rate.md), meaning it changes with fluctuations in the central [bank](../b/bank.md)'s [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) rate. This is distinct from the fixed rate, which remains constant throughout the [swap](../s/swap.md)'s term.

3. **Fixed Rate**:
   The fixed rate in an OIS is agreed upon at the inception of the [swap](../s/swap.md) contract. One party [will](../w/will.md) pay this fixed rate while receiving the floating rate linked to the overnight [index](../i/index.md).

4. **Notional [Principal](../p/principal.md)**:
   The notional [principal](../p/principal.md) is the total amount upon which the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) of [interest](../i/interest.md) payments in the OIS is based. It's called 'notional' because this [principal](../p/principal.md) amount is not actually exchanged between counterparties.

5. **[Compounding](../c/compounding.md)**:
   In an OIS, the [floating interest rate](../f/floating_interest_rate.md) payments are typically compounded daily. This means each day’s [interest](../i/interest.md) accrues [interest](../i/interest.md) on subsequent days, leading to a compounded [interest](../i/interest.md) calculation.

6. **[Maturity](../m/maturity.md)**:
   The [maturity](../m/maturity.md) of an OIS contract can [range](../r/range.md) from a few days to several years. The most common maturities are less than one year.

### Practical Applications of OIS

1. **[Interest Rate](../i/interest_rate.md) Hedging**:
   Financial institutions and corporations use OIS to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) fluctuations. For example, if a company has a floating rate [loan](../l/loan.md), they might enter into an OIS to fix their [interest](../i/interest.md) payments, protecting against rising rates.

2. **[Credit Risk](../c/credit_risk.md) Assessment**:
   OIS [spreads](../s/spreads.md) are used as a measure of [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) in the banking sector. A widening OIS spread indicates increased [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) or decreased [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) in the [interbank market](../i/interbank_market.md).

3. **Benchmarking and Pricing**:
   The OIS rate serves as a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for other financial instruments. For instance, the OIS curve is used to [discount](../d/discount.md) cash flows in the [valuation](../v/valuation.md) of [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md).

### Calculation of OIS Payments

To understand how OIS payments are calculated, let’s consider a simplified example:

- Assume Party A agrees to pay a fixed rate of 1% per annum to Party B.
- Party B agrees to pay a floating rate based on the compounded daily [overnight rate](../o/overnight_rate.md).

If the notional [principal](../p/principal.md) is $10 million, and the [swap](../s/swap.md) lasts for 30 days, the floating rate [payment](../p/payment.md) can be calculated as follows:

- Determine the daily [overnight rate](../o/overnight_rate.md) from the central [bank](../b/bank.md).
- Compound this rate over the 30-day period.
- Compare the compounded floating rate to the fixed rate agreed upon.
- The difference between these two rates, multiplied by the notional [principal](../p/principal.md), gives the net [payment](../p/payment.md) between the parties.

### Example:

Suppose the daily [overnight rate](../o/overnight_rate.md) for the first five days is 0.1%, 0.15%, 0.2%, 0.18%, and 0.12%. The compounded [interest](../i/interest.md) for the first five days would be calculated as:

- Day 1: 1 + 0.1% = 1.001
- Day 2: 1.001 * 1.0015 = 1.0025015
- Day 3: 1.0025015 * 1.002 = 1.0045065
- Day 4: 1.0045065 * 1.0018 = 1.006311
- Day 5: 1.006311 * 1.0012 = 1.007614

The compounded [interest](../i/interest.md) continues for the rest of the 30 days. At the end of the period, Party A and Party B compare the fixed rate [payment](../p/payment.md) to the cumulative compounded floating rate [payment](../p/payment.md). The difference is settled in cash.

### Key Players and Platforms

Several major financial institutions, exchanges, and clearinghouses play pivotal roles in the OIS [market](../m/market.md). Some notable entities include:

1. **[Bloomberg](../b/bloomberg.md) LP**:
   [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/) provides a wide [range](../r/range.md) of financial data and analytics platforms, including tools for OIS analysis and trading. [Bloomberg](../b/bloomberg.md)'s systems are widely used by traders and analysts for [real-time market data](../r/real-time_market_data.md) and pricing.

2. **Intercontinental [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (ICE)**:
   [Intercontinental Exchange](https://www.theice.com/) offers various financial products and services, including trading platforms for [interest rate swaps](../i/interest_rate_swaps.md). ICE provides [clearing](../c/clearing.md) and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) services for OIS transactions.

3. **LCH Limited**:
   [LCH](https://www.lch.com/) is one of the world’s leading clearinghouses and offers comprehensive [clearing](../c/clearing.md) services for [interest rate swaps](../i/interest_rate_swaps.md) among other products. LCH's SwapClear service is widely used for OIS [clearing](../c/clearing.md).

4. **CME Group**:
   [CME Group](https://www.cmegroup.com/) provides [futures](../f/futures.md) and [options](../o/options.md) trading services along with [robust](../r/robust.md) [clearing and settlement](../c/clearing_and_settlement.md) for [interest rate swap](../i/interest_rate_swap.md) transactions, including OIS.

### Risks and Considerations

1. **[Counterparty Risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md)**:
   Since OIS are over-the-counter (OTC) transactions, they carry [counterparty risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md). The possibility that one party may [default](../d/default.md) on its [obligations](../o/obligation.md) is a significant [risk](../r/risk.md) [factor](../f/factor.md). Clearinghouses like LCH reduce this [risk](../r/risk.md) by standing between the two counterparties and guaranteeing the [transaction](../t/transaction.md).

2. **[Liquidity Risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md)**:
   While highly [liquid](../l/liquid.md) for short maturities, OIS can be less [liquid](../l/liquid.md) for longer maturities. This can make it difficult to enter or exit positions without impacting the [market price](../m/market_price.md).

3. **[Model Risk](../m/model_risk.md)**:
   The [valuation](../v/valuation.md) of an OIS requires accurate modeling of [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) dynamics. Incorrect assumptions can lead to significant [valuation](../v/valuation.md) errors and potential losses.

4. **[Basis Risk](../b/basis_risk.md)**:
   [Basis risk](../b/basis_risk.md) occurs when there is a discrepancy between the floating rate of an OIS and the rate of the hedged instrument. This can lead to imperfect hedges and unforeseen financial exposures.

5. **[Regulatory Risk](../r/regulatory_risk.md)**:
   Regulatory changes can impact the OIS [market](../m/market.md). For instance, the transition from LIBOR to alternative reference rates has significant implications for existing and new OIS contracts.

### Conclusion

Overnight [Index](../i/index.md) Swaps are crucial financial instruments used for hedging, benchmarking, and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) in the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) markets. With their floating rate typically linked to a central [bank](../b/bank.md)'s [overnight rate](../o/overnight_rate.md), OIS provide a relatively straightforward mechanism for managing short-term [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) exposure. Despite the various risks associated with OIS, the widespread use of central [clearing](../c/clearing.md) and [robust](../r/robust.md) financial infrastructures helps mitigate many of these concerns. Financial institutions, corporate treasuries, and investors rely on OIS not only for direct financial management but also as a key component in the broader landscape of financial [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) and [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) markets.

Given the complexity and technical aspects of OIS, ongoing education, sophisticated modeling, and [robust](../r/robust.md) [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices are essential for anyone looking to effectively utilize these instruments. Through platforms provided by entities like [Bloomberg](../b/bloomberg.md), ICE, LCH, and CME Group, participants can engage in OIS trading with confidence and accuracy.

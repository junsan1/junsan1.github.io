# Obelisk Consensus Algorithm

The Obelisk Consensus Algorithm is a unique approach to achieving consensus in distributed ledger technology, specifically designed for the Skycoin ecosystem. Aimed at addressing limitations and issues found in other consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS), Obelisk focuses on enhanced security, decentralization, and efficiency.

### Overview

Obelisk is a novel form of consensus that implements a system of "web of trust" in place of traditional mining methods. Unlike PoW, which relies on computational power, and PoS, which leverages ownership stakes, Obelisk uses a network of nodes where each node trusts a set of other nodes. This framework helps in limiting control by any single entity and enhances the network's resistance to attacks.

### Key Components and Concepts

1. **Web of Trust:**
   - In Obelisk, each node maintains a list of other nodes it trusts. This list is essentially a directed acyclic graph (DAG) whereby each node's trust is based on the connections it builds with others.
   - Trust relationships among nodes are public, which allows network participants to identify and avoid potential malicious nodes.

2. **Distributed Consensus:**
   - Nodes communicate to reach a consensus on the state of the ledger without the need for mining. This means there are no substantial computational requirements, making the network both energy-efficient and fast.
   - Each node in the network votes on transactions and blocks, forming a method of agreement through trusted communication channels.

3. **Security:**
   - Obelisk addresses security by decentralizing trust. Each node's influence is proportional to its trust relationships, making it harder for a single entity to exert control over the network.
   - Forks and attacks are more complex to execute due to the interdependence of trusted nodes.

4. **Efficiency:**
   - The algorithm is designed to be lightweight, requiring minimal computational resources. This directly translates into lower operating costs and higher transaction throughput.
   - Without the need for energy-intensive mining or staking, the network maintains ecological sustainability and cost-effectiveness.

5. **Anti-Sybil Mechanisms:**
   - The web of trust inherently offers resistance to Sybil attacks, where an attacker might introduce a large number of fraudulent identities. Since nodes prioritize communication with trusted counterparts, adding fake nodes without establishing trust would be ineffective.

### Practical Implementation

In the Skycoin blockchain, Obelisk is operational and aims to surpass the limitations posed by traditional consensus methods. Skycoin nodes validate and propagate transactions and blocks using the principles outlined above.

### Benefits

1. **Decentralization:**
   - True decentralization is achieved through diverse and distributed trust networks, minimizing the risk of centralization seen in PoW and PoS systems.
   
2. **Environmental Impact:**
   - Energy consumption is drastically reduced, promoting a greener and more sustainable blockchain network.
   
3. **Security and Robustness:**
   - Trust-based consensus guards against many traditional attacks, providing a robust and resilient ledger.

4. **Throughput and Speed:**
   - The consensus process allows for faster transaction validation, enhancing the user experience with quicker confirmations.

### Challenges

1. **Network Trust Initialization:**
   - Establishing initial trust networks can be complex, requiring effective mechanisms for nodes to build trust tables without prior experiences.
   
2. **Scalability:**
   - While more efficient than PoW, the system's scalability depends on maintaining a manageable level of trust relationships, which could become challenging with network growth.
   
3. **Trust Exploitation:**
   - Ensuring that trust relationships are not exploited for fraudulent purposes requires continuous monitoring and potential algorithmic adjustments.

### Conclusion

The Obelisk Consensus Algorithm offers an innovative pathway for achieving distributed consensus, particularly emphasizing the balance between decentralization, security, and efficiency. By leveraging a web of trust, it opens up avenues for sustainable, high-performance blockchain applications.

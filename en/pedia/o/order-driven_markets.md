# Order-Driven Markets

## Introduction

[Order](../o/order.md)-driven markets are a type of financial [market](../m/market.md) structure where buy and sell orders from [market](../m/market.md) participants are directly matched with each other without the intermediary of a [market maker](../m/market_maker.md). This system contrasts with [quote](../q/quote.md)-driven markets, where dealers provide quotes and act as counter-parties to trades. [Order](../o/order.md)-driven markets are widely used in modern electronic trading platforms and are critical for understanding the inner workings of many stock exchanges, [futures](../f/futures.md) markets, and electronic communication networks (ECNs).

## Key Concepts

### Order Book

Central to [order](../o/order.md)-driven markets is the [order book](../o/order_book.md), which is a record of all buy and sell orders entered by participants. The [order book](../o/order_book.md) lists the quantities and prices at which traders are willing to buy or sell an [asset](../a/asset.md). It is updated continuously as new orders are placed and old orders are executed or canceled. The [order book](../o/order_book.md) is transparent to all [market](../m/market.md) participants, providing [visibility](../v/visibility.md) into the [supply](../s/supply.md) and [demand](../d/demand.md) for the [asset](../a/asset.md).

### Types of Orders

1. **Limit Orders:** These are orders to buy or sell an [asset](../a/asset.md) at a specified price or better. Buy limit orders are executed at the limit price or lower, while sell limit orders are executed at the limit price or higher.

2. **[Market](../m/market.md) Orders:** These are orders to buy or sell an [asset](../a/asset.md) immediately at the current [market price](../m/market_price.md). [Market](../m/market.md) orders are executed as soon as they reach the [order book](../o/order_book.md), assuming there is sufficient [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).

3. **Stop Orders:** These are orders to buy or sell an [asset](../a/asset.md) once the [market price](../m/market_price.md) reaches a specified trigger price. They are often used to limit losses or protect profits.

4. **Iceberg Orders:** These are large orders divided into smaller visible parts. When a portion of the [order](../o/order.md) is filled, another portion becomes visible until the entire [order](../o/order.md) is executed. This helps to conceal the full amount of the [order](../o/order.md) from the [market](../m/market.md).

5. **GTC (Good Till Canceled) Orders:** These orders remain active until they are either executed or canceled by the [trader](../t/trader.md). They do not expire at the end of the trading day.

6. **Fill or [Kill](../k/kill.md) (FOK) Orders:** These orders must be executed immediately in their entirety or not at all. Partial [execution](../e/execution.md) is not acceptable.

### Matching Engine

The matching engine is the core of an [order](../o/order.md)-driven [market](../m/market.md). It is the algorithm that processes incoming orders, matches them according to price and time priority, and executes trades. The matching engine is responsible for ensuring that orders are matched fairly and efficiently. It employs various rules and mechanisms to determine the [order](../o/order.md) of [execution](../e/execution.md), including the following:

- **Price-Time Priority:** Orders are matched based on the best price first. If [multiple](../m/multiple.md) orders have the same price, the [order](../o/order.md) entered first is matched first.
- **[Order Matching Algorithms](../o/order_matching_algorithms.md):** Different markets may use different [matching algorithms](../m/matching_algorithms_in_trading.md), such as FIFO (First In, First Out), Pro-rata, or a hybrid approach combining elements of both.

### Market Participants

[Order](../o/order.md)-driven markets are characterized by a diverse [range](../r/range.md) of participants, including individual retail investors, institutional investors, [proprietary trading](../p/proprietary_trading.md) firms, and algorithmic traders. These participants use various strategies to achieve their investment objectives, such as:

- **[Market](../m/market.md) Making:** Providing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) by continuously placing buy and sell orders at different prices.
- **[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md):** Exploiting price discrepancies between different markets or instruments.
- **[Momentum Trading](../m/momentum_trading.md):** Attempting to [profit](../p/profit.md) from short-term price movements based on [market](../m/market.md) trends.
- **[Mean Reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md):** Betting that prices [will](../w/will.md) revert to their historical averages.

### Liquidity and Depth

[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) refers to the ability of the [market](../m/market.md) to facilitate the buying and selling of assets without causing significant price changes. It is a crucial [factor](../f/factor.md) in [order](../o/order.md)-driven markets, as higher [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) generally leads to tighter [bid](../b/bid.md)-ask [spreads](../s/spreads.md) and better [price discovery](../p/price_discovery.md). Depth, on the other hand, refers to the quantity of orders available at different price levels in the [order book](../o/order_book.md).

### Price Discovery

[Price discovery](../p/price_discovery.md) is the process through which the [market](../m/market.md) determines the price of an [asset](../a/asset.md) based on [supply](../s/supply.md) and [demand](../d/demand.md) dynamics. [Order](../o/order.md)-driven markets excel at [price discovery](../p/price_discovery.md) due to their [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and the direct interaction between buy and sell orders. The continuous flow of information from the [order book](../o/order_book.md) allows participants to gauge the [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) and make informed trading decisions.

### Transparency

[Transparency](../t/transparency.md) is a hallmark of [order](../o/order.md)-driven markets. The [visibility](../v/visibility.md) of the [order book](../o/order_book.md) ensures that all participants have access to the same information, promoting fairness and reducing the likelihood of [market manipulation](../m/market_manipulation.md). However, high [transparency](../t/transparency.md) can also lead to challenges, such as increased [market](../m/market.md) impact for large orders.

### Volatility

[Volatility](../v/volatility.md) refers to the degree of variation in [asset](../a/asset.md) prices over time. [Order](../o/order.md)-driven markets can exhibit varying levels of [volatility](../v/volatility.md) based on factors such as [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), news events, and [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md). While high [volatility](../v/volatility.md) can present trading opportunities, it also increases the [risk](../r/risk.md) of sharp price movements.

## Advantages of Order-Driven Markets

1. **[Transparency](../t/transparency.md):** The [open](../o/open.md) nature of the [order book](../o/order_book.md) promotes fairness and equality among [market](../m/market.md) participants.

2. **Efficient [Price Discovery](../p/price_discovery.md):** The continuous interaction between buy and sell orders facilitates accurate and timely [price discovery](../p/price_discovery.md).

3. **Elimination of Intermediaries:** Direct matching of orders reduces the need for intermediaries, potentially lowering [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md).

4. **Flexibility:** A wide [range](../r/range.md) of [order types](../o/order_types_in_trading.md) and [execution](../e/execution.md) [options](../o/options.md) allows traders to implement diverse strategies.

5. **Lower [Market Manipulation](../m/market_manipulation.md) Risks:** [Transparency](../t/transparency.md) and efficient matching reduce the likelihood of [market manipulation](../m/market_manipulation.md) by individual participants.

## Challenges of Order-Driven Markets

1. **[Market](../m/market.md) Impact:** Large orders can have a significant impact on prices due to the [transparency](../t/transparency.md) of the [order book](../o/order_book.md).

2. **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) Fragmentation:** In markets with [multiple](../m/multiple.md) trading venues, [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) can be fragmented across different platforms.

3. **Higher [Volatility](../v/volatility.md):** The absence of [market](../m/market.md) makers can lead to increased [volatility](../v/volatility.md), especially during periods of low [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).

4. **Complexity:** The wide [range](../r/range.md) of [order types](../o/order_types_in_trading.md) and [execution](../e/execution.md) mechanisms can be complex for less-experienced traders.

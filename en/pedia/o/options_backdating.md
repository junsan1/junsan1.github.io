# Options Backdating

[Options](../o/options.md) backdating is a potentially illegal practice where companies alter the date on [stock option](../s/stock_option.md) grants to a time when the stock price was particularly low. This makes the stock [options](../o/options.md) more valuable for the recipient, typically an employee or executive, as the [options](../o/options.md) appear to have been granted at a lower, more favorable price. While stock [options](../o/options.md) are a common compensation tool meant to align the interests of employees and shareholders by giving employees the incentive to increase the company's stock [value](../v/value.md), backdating stock [options](../o/options.md) can distort these incentives and potentially harm shareholders.

## Overview of Stock Options

### Definition and Purpose

Stock [options](../o/options.md) are contracts that give an employee the right to buy a company's stock at a predetermined price, known as the "[exercise price](../e/excersise_price.md)" or "[strike price](../s/strike_price.md)," at some point in the future. They are commonly used as a form of compensation and are intended to align the interests of employees with those of shareholders. If the company performs well and its stock price increases above the [exercise price](../e/excersise_price.md), the employee can [exercise](../e/exercise.md) their [options](../o/options.md), buy the stock at the lower [exercise price](../e/excersise_price.md), and sell it at the current [market price](../m/market_price.md) for a [profit](../p/profit.md).

### Key Terms

- **[Exercise Price](../e/excersise_price.md) ([Strike Price](../s/strike_price.md)):** The fixed price at which an employee can purchase company stock.
- **[Grant](../g/grant.md) Date:** The date on which the [stock option](../s/stock_option.md) is granted to the employee.
- **[Exercise](../e/exercise.md) Date:** The date on which the employee chooses to [exercise](../e/exercise.md) their option to purchase the stock.
- **[Expiration Date](../e/expiration_date.md):** The last date by which the [stock option](../s/stock_option.md) must be exercised.

## Mechanism of Options Backdating

### How Backdating Works

[Options](../o/options.md) backdating occurs when a company retroactively sets the [grant](../g/grant.md) date of a [stock option](../s/stock_option.md) to a date when the stock price was lower, thus increasing the potential [profit](../p/profit.md) for the option holder. For instance, if a company’s stock was priced at $50 on January 1 and later increased to $70 on February 1, backdating an option to January 1 would allow the recipient to [exercise](../e/exercise.md) the option at $50 rather than at the $70 February price, resulting in an immediate, [risk](../r/risk.md)-free [gain](../g/gain.md).

### Motivation Behind Backdating

The primary motivation behind [options](../o/options.md) backdating is to provide greater compensation to employees and executives without immediately reflecting these costs on the company’s [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md). By backdating, companies can [offer](../o/offer.md) a more valuable [stock option](../s/stock_option.md) without appearing to have granted excessive compensation.

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

### Regulatory Environment

[Options](../o/options.md) backdating is scrutinized under various securities and tax regulations. The practice became a major [issue](../i/issue.md) in the early 2000s when it was revealed that many companies were engaging in backdating. Significant regulatory oversight comes from bodies such as the U.S. Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC). Laws and guidelines concerning stock [options](../o/options.md) and their [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) include:

- **[Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002](../s/sarbanes-oxley_(sox)_act_of_2002.md):** This act requires companies to report [stock option](../s/stock_option.md) grants to the SEC within two [business](../b/business.md) days, thereby making it more difficult to backdate [options](../o/options.md) without getting caught.
- **IRS Section 409A:** Establishes special requirements for [deferred compensation](../d/deferred_compensation.md) plans and imposes penalties for failing to comply with its guidelines, indirectly affecting the feasibility of backdating [options](../o/options.md).

### Ethical Implications

[Options](../o/options.md) backdating is widely considered unethical because it misleads shareholders and can damage the [trust](../t/trust.md) and integrity of the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). Backdating undermines the intent of stock [options](../o/options.md), which is to tie compensation to performance. When companies backdate [options](../o/options.md), they effectively provide compensation without [tying](../t/tying.md) it to any actual performance improvement.

### High-Profile Cases

Numerous high-profile companies have been implicated in [options](../o/options.md) backdating scandals. For example, software giant Apple Inc. was investigated in the mid-2000s for backdating stock [options](../o/options.md), and several executives were implicated. Although then-CEO Steve Jobs was found to have been aware of the practice, he was not charged with wrongdoing.

## Detection and Prevention

### Detection Methods

Regulators and auditors use several methods to detect backdating, including:

- **Comparing [Grant](../g/grant.md) Dates and Reporting Dates:** Analyzing the gap between the option [grant](../g/grant.md) date and the date it was reported to the SEC. Smaller [gaps](../g/gap.md) conform to legal requirements.
- **Stock [Price Patterns](../p/price_patterns.md):** Reviewing stock [price patterns](../p/price_patterns.md) around [grant](../g/grant.md) dates to identify suspiciously advantageous option [exercise](../e/exercise.md) prices.

### Best Practices for Prevention

To prevent [options](../o/options.md) backdating, companies should adopt stringent [internal controls](../i/internal_controls.md) and adherence to ethical [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) practices:

- **Automated [Grant](../g/grant.md) Date Systems:** Use automated systems to record [grant](../g/grant.md) dates for stock [options](../o/options.md) to minimize human error and intentional backdating.
- **Board Oversight:** Ensure that the board of directors, particularly the compensation committee, oversees [stock option](../s/stock_option.md) grants.
- **Independent Audits:** Conduct regular independent audits focusing on compensation practices.

## Impact on Shareholders and Employees

### Shareholder Impact

[Options](../o/options.md) backdating can have several adverse effects on shareholders:

- **[Dilution](../d/dilution.md) of [Shares](../s/shares.md):** It increases the overall number of [shares](../s/shares.md) outstanding, diluting the [value](../v/value.md) of existing [shares](../s/shares.md).
- **Misleading [Financial Statements](../f/financial_statements.md):** Backdating often leads to misstated [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md), which can result in significant consequences if shareholders make investment decisions based on inaccurate information.
- **Legal and Regulatory Penalties:** Companies caught engaging in backdating can face severe legal and financial penalties, further harming [shareholder value](../s/shareholder_value.md).

### Employee Impact

For employees, especially those not involved in backdating practices, there can be both positive and negative effects:

- **Temporary Gains:** Employees may benefit from temporary financial gains from backdated [options](../o/options.md).
- **Long-term Risks:** The discovery of backdating practices can lead to loss of [trust](../t/trust.md), legal ramifications, and potential clawbacks of received benefits.

# Original Face

## Definition
**Original Face** (also known as Original Face Value) refers to the initial principal amount of a mortgage-backed security (MBS) or a similar type of debt instrument at the time it is issued. This amount represents the total sum of the underlying mortgages or loans that were pooled to create the security.

## Key Components
1. **Principal Amount**: The original face value is the total principal of all the loans included in the MBS at issuance.
2. **Mortgage-Backed Security (MBS)**: A type of investment that pools various home loans and sells them as a single security to investors.
3. **Amortization**: Over time, the principal amount of the loans is paid down, reducing the face value of the MBS.

## Importance
1. **Valuation**: The original face value is crucial for determining the valuation and pricing of mortgage-backed securities.
2. **Investment Analysis**: Investors use the original face value to assess the potential returns and risks associated with the security.
3. **Payment Structure**: Understanding the original face value helps in predicting the cash flow structure and repayment schedule of the MBS.

## Example Scenarios
1. **Issuance of MBS**: A mortgage-backed security is issued with an original face value of $500 million, representing the total amount of the pooled home loans.
2. **Monthly Payments**: As homeowners make monthly mortgage payments, the principal amount is gradually paid down, reducing the current face value from the original face value.
3. **Investor Reports**: Investors receive reports showing the original face value and the remaining face value to track the performance of their MBS investments.

## Related Terms
1. **Current Face**: The remaining principal amount of a mortgage-backed security at any given point in time after issuance.
2. **Face Value**: The nominal or par value of a financial instrument, often used interchangeably with original face in the context of MBS.
3. **Amortization**: The process of gradually paying off the principal amount of a loan through scheduled payments.

## Challenges
1. **Prepayment Risk**: Borrowers may pay off their mortgages early, reducing the principal more quickly than anticipated and impacting the returns on the MBS.
2. **Default Risk**: If borrowers default on their loans, the principal amount may not be fully recovered, affecting the original face value.
3. **Market Fluctuations**: Changes in interest rates and market conditions can affect the valuation of the original face value of an MBS.

## Best Practices
1. **Due Diligence**: Conduct thorough due diligence on the underlying mortgages and the issuing entity before investing in MBS.
2. **Risk Assessment**: Assess the risks associated with prepayment, default, and market fluctuations to make informed investment decisions.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the performance of the MBS and the remaining face value to track investment returns and risks.

## Conclusion
The original face value is a fundamental concept in mortgage-backed securities, representing the initial principal amount of the pooled loans at issuance. It plays a critical role in valuation, investment analysis, and understanding the payment structure of MBS. By understanding the key components, importance, and best practices associated with original face value, investors can make informed decisions and effectively manage their investments in mortgage-backed securities.

# Original Face

## Definition
**Original Face** (also known as Original [Face Value](../f/face_value.md)) refers to the initial [principal](../p/principal.md) amount of a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-backed [security](../s/security.md) (MBS) or a similar type of [debt instrument](../d/debt_instrument.md) at the time it is issued. This amount represents the total sum of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) mortgages or loans that were pooled to create the [security](../s/security.md).

## Key Components
1. **[Principal](../p/principal.md) Amount**: The original [face value](../f/face_value.md) is the total [principal](../p/principal.md) of all the loans included in the MBS at issuance.
2. **[Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-Backed [Security](../s/security.md) (MBS)**: A type of investment that pools various [home](../h/home.md) loans and sells them as a single [security](../s/security.md) to investors.
3. **Amortization**: Over time, the [principal](../p/principal.md) amount of the loans is paid down, reducing the [face value](../f/face_value.md) of the MBS.

## Importance
1. **[Valuation](../v/valuation.md)**: The original [face value](../f/face_value.md) is crucial for determining the [valuation](../v/valuation.md) and pricing of [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-backed securities.
2. **[Investment Analysis](../i/investment_analysis.md)**: Investors use the original [face value](../f/face_value.md) to assess the potential returns and risks associated with the [security](../s/security.md).
3. **[Payment](../p/payment.md) Structure**: Understanding the original [face value](../f/face_value.md) helps in predicting the [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) structure and [repayment](../r/repayment.md) schedule of the MBS.

## Example Scenarios
1. **Issuance of MBS**: A [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-backed [security](../s/security.md) is issued with an original [face value](../f/face_value.md) of $500 million, representing the total amount of the pooled [home](../h/home.md) loans.
2. **Monthly Payments**: As homeowners make monthly [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) payments, the [principal](../p/principal.md) amount is gradually paid down, reducing the current [face value](../f/face_value.md) from the original [face value](../f/face_value.md).
3. **[Investor](../i/investor.md) Reports**: Investors receive reports showing the original [face value](../f/face_value.md) and the remaining [face value](../f/face_value.md) to track the performance of their MBS investments.

## Related Terms
1. **Current Face**: The remaining [principal](../p/principal.md) amount of a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-backed [security](../s/security.md) at any given point in time after issuance.
2. **[Face Value](../f/face_value.md)**: The [nominal](../n/nominal.md) or [par value](../p/par_value.md) of a [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md), often used interchangeably with original face in the context of MBS.
3. **Amortization**: The process of gradually paying off the [principal](../p/principal.md) amount of a [loan](../l/loan.md) through scheduled payments.

## Challenges
1. **[Prepayment Risk](../p/prepayment_risk.md)**: Borrowers may pay off their mortgages early, reducing the [principal](../p/principal.md) more quickly than anticipated and impacting the returns on the MBS.
2. **[Default Risk](../d/default_risk.md)**: If borrowers [default](../d/default.md) on their loans, the [principal](../p/principal.md) amount may not be fully recovered, affecting the original [face value](../f/face_value.md).
3. **[Market](../m/market.md) Fluctuations**: Changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and [market](../m/market.md) conditions can affect the [valuation](../v/valuation.md) of the original [face value](../f/face_value.md) of an MBS.

## Best Practices
1. **[Due Diligence](../d/due_diligence.md)**: Conduct thorough [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md) on the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) mortgages and the issuing entity before [investing](../i/investing.md) in MBS.
2. **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Assessment**: Assess the risks associated with [prepayment](../p/prepayment.md), [default](../d/default.md), and [market](../m/market.md) fluctuations to make informed investment decisions.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the performance of the MBS and the remaining [face value](../f/face_value.md) to track investment returns and risks.

## Conclusion
The original [face value](../f/face_value.md) is a fundamental concept in [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-backed securities, representing the initial [principal](../p/principal.md) amount of the pooled loans at issuance. It plays a critical role in [valuation](../v/valuation.md), [investment analysis](../i/investment_analysis.md), and understanding the [payment](../p/payment.md) structure of MBS. By understanding the key components, importance, and [best practices](../b/best_practices.md) associated with original [face value](../f/face_value.md), investors can make informed decisions and effectively manage their investments in [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-backed securities.

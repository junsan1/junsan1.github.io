# Open Outcry

[Open](../o/open.md) Outcry is a traditional method of communication between professionals on a stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md) trading floor, involving shouting and the use of hand signals to convey buying and selling intentions. This method has been widely used in [futures](../f/futures.md) exchanges and various commodities markets for over a century. Despite the rise of electronic [trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md), [Open](../o/open.md) Outcry remains a significant part of [market](../m/market.md) history and is still used in some trading pits around the world.

## Historical Context

[Open](../o/open.md) outcry has its roots in the 19th century when centralized exchanges began to form. Trading floors were bustling centers where brokers represented their clients in competitive, physical environments. Among the earliest adopters of this system were stock and [commodity](../c/commodity.md) exchanges in the United States and Europe, including the Chicago Board of [Trade](../t/trade.md) (CBOT) [CBOT](https://www.cmegroup.com/), the New York Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (NYSE) [NYSE](https://www.nyse.com/), and the London Metal [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (LME) [LME](https://www.lme.com/).

## Mechanism and Techniques

### Communication

At the heart of [open](../o/open.md) outcry are the traders who vocalize their bids and offers in a loud, chaotic environment. These verbal announcements are complemented by a sophisticated system of hand signals, ensuring that transactions can be completed even when verbal communication becomes difficult. Hand signals are crucial, especially for indicating quantities and differentiating between buy and sell orders.

### Types of Orders

Orders on the trading floor can generally be categorized into:
- **[Market](../m/market.md) Orders**: Executed immediately at the best available price.
- **Limit Orders**: Executed at a specific price or better.
- **Stop Orders**: Executed only when the [market](../m/market.md) reaches a certain [price level](../p/price_level.md).

### Clearing and Settlement

After a [trade](../t/trade.md) is executed via [open](../o/open.md) outcry, it must be recorded and cleared. Exchanges typically have a clearinghouse that acts as an intermediary between the buyer and seller, ensuring the integrity and completion of the [trade](../t/trade.md). The [clearing](../c/clearing.md) process involves confirming the [transaction](../t/transaction.md) details and settling the actual [exchange](../e/exchange.md) of assets and funds.

## Pros and Cons

### Advantages

- **[Transparency](../t/transparency.md)**: Quotes and trades are visible to all participants, promoting a fair and [open market](../o/open_market.md).
- **[Price Discovery](../p/price_discovery.md)**: Active bidding and [offering](../o/offering.md) provide a real-time reflection of [supply](../s/supply.md) and [demand](../d/demand.md), aiding in [price discovery](../p/price_discovery.md).
- **Human Element**: Allows for the assessment of [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) and other subtleties that may be hard to quantify.

### Disadvantages

- **Inefficiency**: Slower than electronic trading, as it relies on human speed and accuracy.
- **Limited Accessibility**: Requires physical presence on the trading floor, restricting participation.
- **Human Error**: Susceptible to mistakes in communication and recording.

## Transition to Electronic Trading

The advent of electronic trading platforms has largely overshadowed the [open](../o/open.md) outcry system. Electronic systems [offer](../o/offer.md) substantial advantages in terms of speed, [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md), and reduced costs. Nonetheless, some traders believe that electronic systems cannot entirely replicate the nuances and [transparency](../t/transparency.md) of [open](../o/open.md) outcry.

### Hybrid Models

Some exchanges have adopted hybrid models that combine electronic systems with the traditional [open](../o/open.md) outcry to [leverage](../l/leverage.md) the benefits of both methods. For example, the Intercontinental [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (ICE) [ICE](https://www.theice.com/) operates electronic platforms while still maintaining some [open](../o/open.md) outcry pits for certain commodities.

## Remaining Strongholds

Despite a broad shift toward electronic trading, [open](../o/open.md) outcry continues to be a significant practice in certain markets and exchanges:

- **Chicago Mercantile [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (CME)**: Maintains pits for trading [options on futures](../o/options_on_futures.md) [CME](https://www.cmegroup.com/).
- **New York Mercantile [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (NYMEX)**: Trades energy products and metals [NYMEX](https://www.cmegroup.com/).

## Case Study: London Metal Exchange

The London Metal [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (LME) remains one of the most notable strongholds of [open](../o/open.md) outcry, utilizing a method known as "the Ring." Traders gather in a circular booth and engage in designated "ring sessions" where specific metals are traded at set times. The LME's commitment to this traditional trading method underscores the [value](../v/value.md) some markets place on the human elements of trading [LME](https://www.lme.com/).

## The Future of Open Outcry

The future of [open](../o/open.md) outcry remains uncertain. Given the rapid technological advancements and growing preference for electronic [trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md), the prevalence of [open](../o/open.md) outcry is likely to diminish further. However, some niche markets and exchanges may continue to preserve this method for its unique advantages in [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and [price discovery](../p/price_discovery.md).

In summary, while [open](../o/open.md) outcry may seem like a relic from the past, its influence on modern trading principles and practices is undeniable. As markets evolve, the lessons and techniques of [open](../o/open.md) outcry continue to inform the development of more advanced [trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md).

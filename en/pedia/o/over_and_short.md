# Over and Short

In the context of finance and trading, the terms "over" and "short" are used to describe discrepancies that occur in financial transactions, accounting, and inventory management. These discrepancies can take place in a variety of scenarios and often require meticulous attention to detail to identify, correct, and prevent.

## Introduction

Overs and shorts (O/S) are important facets of financial management and trading operations, particularly in roles involving cash handling, inventory counting, and security trading. "Over" refers to a surplus situation where there are more funds, securities, or items recorded than are actually on hand. Conversely, "short" refers to a deficit where there are fewer funds, securities, or items than what official records show.

Understanding, identifying, and managing overs and shorts is critical for accurate financial reporting, regulatory compliance, and operational efficiency. Below, we dive deeper into the different contexts where "over" and "short" are particularly relevant â€“ banking and cash handling, securities trading, and inventory management.

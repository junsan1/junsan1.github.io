# Option Pricing Models

Option pricing models are mathematical formulations used to determine the theoretical value of options. These models help traders and investors assess the fairness of the current market prices of options, aiding in their trading and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) decisions. Option pricing is a cornerstone of financial [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), and efficient pricing models are crucial for both market makers and traders who engage in options trading. Several models have been developed over the years, each with its own set of assumptions and applications. This article provides an in-depth look at some of the most widely used option pricing models in the field of [financial engineering](../f/financial_engineering.md) and [quantitative finance](../q/quantitative_finance.md).

### 1. Black-Scholes Model

One of the most famous and widely used option pricing models is the [Black-Scholes Model](../b/black-scholes_model.md). Developed by Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and Robert Merton in 1973, this model provides a closed-form solution for pricing European call and [put options](../p/put_options.md).

**Fundamental Assumptions:**
- The stock price follows a [geometric Brownian motion](../g/geometric_brownian_motion.md) with constant drift and volatility.
- The option can only be exercised at expiration (European-style option).
- No dividends are paid out during the life of the option.
- Markets are efficient (i.e., market movements are unpredictable).
- No commissions or transaction costs.
- Interest rates are constant and known.

**Black-Scholes Formula:**
For a European call option, the formula is:
\[ C = S_0 N(d_1) - X e^{-rT} N(d_2) \]

For a European put option, the formula is:
\[ P = X e^{-rT} N(-d_2) - S_0 N(-d_1) \]

where:
- \( d_1 = \frac{\ln(S_0 / X) + (r + \sigma^2 / 2)T}{\sigma \sqrt{T}} \)
- \( d_2 = d_1 - \sigma \sqrt{T} \)
- \( S_0 \) = Current stock price
- \( X \) = Strike price of the option
- \( r \) = Risk-free interest rate
- \( T \) = Time to maturity
- \( \sigma \) = Volatility of the stock
- \( N(\cdot) \) = [Cumulative distribution function](../c/cumulative_distribution_function_in_trading.md) of the standard [normal distribution](../n/normal_distribution_in_trading.md)

### 2. Binomial Option Pricing Model

The [Binomial Option Pricing Model](../b/binomial_option_pricing_model.md), developed by John Cox, Stephen Ross, and Mark Rubinstein in 1979, offers a discrete-time approach to option pricing. This model can be used to price American options, which can be exercised at any time before expiration.

**Fundamental Assumptions:**
- The option's life is divided into several time intervals.
- During each time interval, the stock price can either move up with a certain probability or move down with the complementary probability.
- The model progresses by backtracking from the expiration date to the present.

**Binomial Model Steps:**
1. **Construct a binomial tree:**
   - Define the up (\(u\)) and down (\(d\)) factors such that \(u > 1\) and \(d < 1\).
   - Calculate up and down movements using \( u = e^{\sigma \sqrt{\Delta t}} \) and \( d = e^{-\sigma \sqrt{\Delta t}} \).
2. **Calculate option values at each final node:**
   - For a call option: \( \max(S_T - X, 0) \)
   - For a put option: \( \max(X - S_T, 0) \)
3. **Backward induction:**
   - Calculate the option price at each preceding node by discounting the expected value of the option prices at the next time step.

### 3. Monte Carlo Simulation

[Monte Carlo simulation](../m/monte_carlo_simulation.md) is a numerical method that uses random sampling to estimate the value of an option. It is particularly useful for pricing complex [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) that do not have closed-form solutions.

**Fundamental Assumptions:**
- The underlying asset price follows a stochastic process, such as [geometric Brownian motion](../g/geometric_brownian_motion.md).
- The [simulation](../s/simulation_in_trading.md) can accommodate various features, such as [path dependency](../p/path_dependency_in_trading.md) and multiple sources of [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md).

**Monte Carlo Steps:**
1. **Simulate multiple paths for the underlying asset price:**
   - Generate random price paths based on the assumed stochastic process.
2. **Calculate the payoff for each path:**
   - For a European call option: \( \max(S_T - X, 0) \)
   - For a European put option: \( \max(X - S_T, 0) \)
3. **Discount the payoffs to present value:**
   - Average the discounted payoffs to estimate the option price.

### 4. Heston Model

The Heston Model, introduced by Steven Heston in 1993, incorporates stochastic volatility to address some limitations of the [Black-Scholes Model](../b/black-scholes_model.md). This model assumes that volatility is not constant but follows its own stochastic process.

**Fundamental Assumptions:**
- The stock price and its volatility are driven by two correlated Wiener processes.
- Volatility exhibits [mean reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md).

**Heston Model Dynamics:**
- Stock price: \( dS_t = \mu S_t dt + \sqrt{V_t} S_t dW_t^S \)
- Variance: \( dV_t = \kappa(\theta - V_t)dt + \sigma \sqrt{V_t} dW_t^V \)

where:
- \( S_t \) = Stock price at time \(t\)
- \( V_t \) = Variance at time \(t\)
- \( \mu \) = Drift rate of the stock price
- \( \kappa \) = Rate of [mean reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md) of \( V_t \)
- \( \theta \) = Long-term mean of the variance
- \( \sigma \) = Volatility of the variance
- \( dW_t^S \) and \( dW_t^V \) are Wiener processes with correlation \( \rho \)

### 5. Hull-White Model

The Hull-White Model, developed by John Hull and Alan White in 1987, extends the Black-Scholes framework to incorporate stochastic interest rates. This model allows for the pricing of interest rate [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) and other financial instruments sensitive to interest rate movements.

**Fundamental Assumptions:**
- The short-term interest rate follows a mean-reverting stochastic process.
- The model can be calibrated to fit the initial [term structure of interest rates](../t/term_structure_of_interest_rates.md).

**Hull-White Model Dynamics:**
- Short rate: \( dr(t) = \alpha(t) [\theta(t) - r(t)] dt + \sigma(t) dW_t \)

where:
- \( r(t) \) = Short-term interest rate at time \(t\)
- \( \alpha(t) \) = Mean-reversion rate
- \( \theta(t) \) = Time-dependent mean to which \( r(t) \) reverts
- \( \sigma(t) \) = Volatility of the short-term rate
- \( dW_t \) = Wiener process

### 6. SABR Model

The SABR (Stochastic Alpha, Beta, Rho) Model, introduced by Patrick Hagan, Deep Kumar, Andrew Lesniewski, and Diana Woodward in 2002, is used to model the volatility smile in the financial markets. It is particularly popular for pricing interest rate [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) and other products that exhibit skewed or [asymmetric volatility](../a/asymmetric_volatility.md) patterns.

**Fundamental Assumptions:**
- The underlying asset and its volatility follow correlated [stochastic processes](../s/stochastic_processes.md).
- The model can capture the observed market phenomenon of [volatility skew](../v/volatility_skew.md) or smile.

**SABR Model Dynamics:**
- Asset price: \( dS_t = \sigma_t S_t^\beta dW_t^S \)
- Volatility: \( d\sigma_t = \nu \sigma_t dW_t^\sigma \)

where:
- \( S_t \) = Asset price at time \(t\)
- \( \sigma_t \) = Volatility at time \(t\)
- \( \beta \) = Elasticity parameter (usually between 0 and 1)
- \( \nu \) = Volatility of volatility
- \( dW_t^S \) and \( dW_t^\sigma \) are correlated Wiener processes with correlation \( \rho \)

### 7. Bachelier Model

The Bachelier Model, also known as the Normal Model, is one of the earliest option pricing models, introduced by Louis Bachelier in 1900. Unlike the [Black-Scholes Model](../b/black-scholes_model.md), which assumes [log-normal distribution](../l/log-normal_distribution.md) of asset prices, the Bachelier Model assumes a [normal distribution](../n/normal_distribution_in_trading.md) of asset prices.

**Fundamental Assumptions:**
- The asset price follows an arithmetic Brownian motion with constant volatility.
- The distribution of asset prices is normal, not log-normal.

**Bachelier Formula:**
For a European call option, the formula is:
\[ C = e^{-rT} \left[ (S_0 - X) N(d) + \sigma \sqrt{T} n(d) \right] \]

For a European put option, the formula is:
\[ P = e^{-rT} \left[ (X - S_0) N(-d) + \sigma \sqrt{T} n(d) \right] \]

where:
- \( d = \frac{S_0 - X}{\sigma \sqrt{T}} \)
- \( n(\cdot) \) = [Probability density function](../p/probability_density_function.md) of the standard [normal distribution](../n/normal_distribution_in_trading.md)

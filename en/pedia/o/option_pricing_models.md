# Option Pricing Models

Option pricing models are mathematical formulations used to determine the theoretical [value](../v/value.md) of [options](../o/options.md). These models help traders and investors assess the fairness of the current [market](../m/market.md) prices of [options](../o/options.md), aiding in their trading and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) decisions. Option pricing is a cornerstone of financial [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), and efficient pricing models are crucial for both [market](../m/market.md) makers and traders who engage in [options](../o/options.md) trading. Several models have been developed over the years, each with its own set of assumptions and applications. This article provides an in-depth look at some of the most widely used option pricing models in the field of [financial engineering](../f/financial_engineering.md) and [quantitative finance](../q/quantitative_finance.md).

### 1. Black-Scholes Model

One of the most famous and widely used option pricing models is the [Black-Scholes Model](../b/black-scholes_model.md). Developed by Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and Robert Merton in 1973, this model provides a closed-form solution for pricing European call and [put options](../p/put_options.md).

**Fundamental Assumptions:**
- The stock price follows a [geometric Brownian motion](../g/geometric_brownian_motion.md) with constant drift and [volatility](../v/volatility.md).
- The option can only be exercised at expiration (European-style option).
- No dividends are paid out during the life of the option.
- Markets are efficient (i.e., [market](../m/market.md) movements are unpredictable).
- No commissions or [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md).
- [Interest](../i/interest.md) rates are constant and known.

**Black-Scholes Formula:**
For a European [call option](../c/call_option.md), the formula is:
\[ C = S_0 N(d_1) - X e^{-rT} N(d_2) \]

For a European [put option](../p/put.md), the formula is:
\[ P = X e^{-rT} N(-d_2) - S_0 N(-d_1) \]

where:
- \( d_1 = \frac{\ln(S_0 / X) + (r + \sigma^2 / 2)T}{\sigma \sqrt{T}} \)
- \( d_2 = d_1 - \sigma \sqrt{T} \)
- \( S_0 \) = Current stock price
- \( X \) = [Strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of the option
- \( r \) = [Risk](../r/risk.md)-free [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md)
- \( T \) = Time to [maturity](../m/maturity.md)
- \( \sigma \) = [Volatility](../v/volatility.md) of the stock
- \( N(\cdot) \) = [Cumulative distribution function](../c/cumulative_distribution_function_in_trading.md) of the standard [normal distribution](../n/normal_distribution_in_trading.md)

### 2. Binomial Option Pricing Model

The [Binomial Option Pricing Model](../b/binomial_option_pricing_model.md), developed by John Cox, Stephen Ross, and Mark Rubinstein in 1979, offers a discrete-time approach to option pricing. This model can be used to price American [options](../o/options.md), which can be exercised at any time before expiration.

**Fundamental Assumptions:**
- The option's life is divided into several time intervals.
- During each time interval, the stock price can either move up with a certain probability or move down with the complementary probability.
- The model progresses by backtracking from the [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md) to the present.

**Binomial Model Steps:**
1. **Construct a binomial tree:**
   - Define the up (\(u\)) and down (\(d\)) factors such that \(u > 1\) and \(d < 1\).
   - Calculate up and down movements using \( u = e^{\sigma \sqrt{\[Delta](../d/delta.md) t}} \) and \( d = e^{-\sigma \sqrt{\[Delta](../d/delta.md) t}} \).
2. **Calculate option values at each final node:**
   - For a [call option](../c/call_option.md): \( \max(S_T - X, 0) \)
   - For a [put option](../p/put.md): \( \max(X - S_T, 0) \)
3. **Backward induction:**
   - Calculate the option price at each preceding node by [discounting](../d/discounting.md) the [expected value](../e/expected_value.md) of the option prices at the next time step.

### 3. Monte Carlo Simulation

[Monte Carlo simulation](../m/monte_carlo_simulation.md) is a numerical method that uses random [sampling](../s/sampling.md) to estimate the [value](../v/value.md) of an option. It is particularly useful for pricing complex [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) that do not have closed-form solutions.

**Fundamental Assumptions:**
- The [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) price follows a stochastic process, such as [geometric Brownian motion](../g/geometric_brownian_motion.md).
- The [simulation](../s/simulation_in_trading.md) can accommodate various features, such as [path dependency](../p/path_dependency_in_trading.md) and [multiple](../m/multiple.md) sources of [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md).

**Monte Carlo Steps:**
1. **Simulate [multiple](../m/multiple.md) paths for the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) price:**
   - Generate random price paths based on the assumed stochastic process.
2. **Calculate the payoff for each path:**
   - For a European [call option](../c/call_option.md): \( \max(S_T - X, 0) \)
   - For a European [put option](../p/put.md): \( \max(X - S_T, 0) \)
3. **[Discount](../d/discount.md) the payoffs to [present value](../p/present_value.md):**
   - Average the discounted payoffs to estimate the option price.

### 4. Heston Model

The [Heston Model](../h/heston_model.md), introduced by Steven Heston in 1993, incorporates stochastic [volatility](../v/volatility.md) to address some limitations of the [Black-Scholes Model](../b/black-scholes_model.md). This model assumes that [volatility](../v/volatility.md) is not constant but follows its own stochastic process.

**Fundamental Assumptions:**
- The stock price and its [volatility](../v/volatility.md) are driven by two correlated Wiener processes.
- [Volatility](../v/volatility.md) exhibits [mean reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md).

**[Heston Model](../h/heston_model.md) Dynamics:**
- Stock price: \( dS_t = \mu S_t dt + \sqrt{V_t} S_t dW_t^S \)
- Variance: \( dV_t = \[kappa](../k/kappa.md)(\[theta](../t/theta.md) - V_t)dt + \sigma \sqrt{V_t} dW_t^V \)

where:
- \( S_t \) = Stock price at time \(t\)
- \( V_t \) = Variance at time \(t\)
- \( \mu \) = Drift rate of the stock price
- \( \[kappa](../k/kappa.md) \) = Rate of [mean reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md) of \( V_t \)
- \( \[theta](../t/theta.md) \) = Long-term mean of the variance
- \( \sigma \) = [Volatility](../v/volatility.md) of the variance
- \( dW_t^S \) and \( dW_t^V \) are Wiener processes with [correlation](../c/correlation.md) \( \[rho](../r/rho.md) \)

### 5. Hull-White Model

The [Hull-White Model](../h/hull-white_model.md), developed by John Hull and Alan White in 1987, extends the Black-Scholes framework to incorporate stochastic [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. This model allows for the pricing of [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) and other financial instruments sensitive to [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) movements.

**Fundamental Assumptions:**
- The short-term [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) follows a mean-reverting stochastic process.
- The model can be calibrated to fit the initial [term structure of interest rates](../t/term_structure_of_interest_rates.md).

**[Hull-White Model](../h/hull-white_model.md) Dynamics:**
- Short rate: \( dr(t) = \[alpha](../a/alpha.md)(t) [\[theta](../t/theta.md)(t) - r(t)] dt + \sigma(t) dW_t \)

where:
- \( r(t) \) = Short-term [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) at time \(t\)
- \( \[alpha](../a/alpha.md)(t) \) = Mean-reversion rate
- \( \[theta](../t/theta.md)(t) \) = Time-dependent mean to which \( r(t) \) reverts
- \( \sigma(t) \) = [Volatility](../v/volatility.md) of the short-term rate
- \( dW_t \) = Wiener process

### 6. SABR Model

The SABR (Stochastic [Alpha](../a/alpha.md), [Beta](../b/beta.md), [Rho](../r/rho.md)) Model, introduced by Patrick Hagan, Deep Kumar, Andrew Lesniewski, and Diana Woodward in 2002, is used to model the [volatility smile](../v/volatility_smile.md) in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). It is particularly popular for pricing [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) and other products that exhibit skewed or [asymmetric volatility](../a/asymmetric_volatility.md) patterns.

**Fundamental Assumptions:**
- The [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) and its [volatility](../v/volatility.md) follow correlated [stochastic processes](../s/stochastic_processes.md).
- The model can capture the observed [market](../m/market.md) phenomenon of [volatility skew](../v/volatility_skew.md) or smile.

**SABR Model Dynamics:**
- [Asset](../a/asset.md) price: \( dS_t = \sigma_t S_t^\[beta](../b/beta.md) dW_t^S \)
- [Volatility](../v/volatility.md): \( d\sigma_t = \nu \sigma_t dW_t^\sigma \)

where:
- \( S_t \) = [Asset](../a/asset.md) price at time \(t\)
- \( \sigma_t \) = [Volatility](../v/volatility.md) at time \(t\)
- \( \[beta](../b/beta.md) \) = [Elasticity](../e/elasticity.md) parameter (usually between 0 and 1)
- \( \nu \) = [Volatility](../v/volatility.md) of [volatility](../v/volatility.md)
- \( dW_t^S \) and \( dW_t^\sigma \) are correlated Wiener processes with [correlation](../c/correlation.md) \( \[rho](../r/rho.md) \)

### 7. Bachelier Model

The Bachelier Model, also known as the Normal Model, is one of the earliest option pricing models, introduced by Louis Bachelier in 1900. Unlike the [Black-Scholes Model](../b/black-scholes_model.md), which assumes [log-normal distribution](../l/log-normal_distribution.md) of [asset](../a/asset.md) prices, the Bachelier Model assumes a [normal distribution](../n/normal_distribution_in_trading.md) of [asset](../a/asset.md) prices.

**Fundamental Assumptions:**
- The [asset](../a/asset.md) price follows an arithmetic Brownian motion with constant [volatility](../v/volatility.md).
- The [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of [asset](../a/asset.md) prices is normal, not log-normal.

**Bachelier Formula:**
For a European [call option](../c/call_option.md), the formula is:
\[ C = e^{-rT} \left[ (S_0 - X) N(d) + \sigma \sqrt{T} n(d) \right] \]

For a European [put option](../p/put.md), the formula is:
\[ P = e^{-rT} \left[ (X - S_0) N(-d) + \sigma \sqrt{T} n(d) \right] \]

where:
- \( d = \frac{S_0 - X}{\sigma \sqrt{T}} \)
- \( n(\cdot) \) = [Probability density function](../p/probability_density_function.md) of the standard [normal distribution](../n/normal_distribution_in_trading.md)

# OTC Pink

OTC Pink, also commonly referred to as the [Pink Sheets](../p/pink_sheets.md), is a [trading platform](../t/trading_platform.md) for over-the-counter (OTC) securities in the United States. It is one of the marketplaces provided by OTC Markets Group and represents the lowest tier of the three marketplaces. The platform primarily lists companies that are not required to file with the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC), making it a haven for smaller or financially troubled companies seeking to [trade](../t/trade.md) their [shares](../s/shares.md). This document explores the intricacies of OTC Pink, its categories, benefits, risks, and its overall importance in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

## Overview of OTC Pink

OTC Pink is a decentralized and non-transparent trading venue where securities are not [listed](../l/listed.md) on major exchanges such as the NYSE or [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md). Instead, trades are executed through a network of dealers. The "Pink" in OTC Pink originally comes from the color of the paper on which the quotes were printed in earlier days. Today, the platform operates electronically but retains the nickname.

OTC Pink is unique compared to other marketplaces because it does not have stringent reporting requirements or listing standards. Consequently, companies on OTC Pink [range](../r/range.md) from small startups to financially distressed corporations. Unlike [OTCQX](../o/otcqx.md) and OTCQB, the other tiers of OTC Markets, OTC Pink allows virtually any company to [trade](../t/trade.md), [offering](../o/offering.md) a distinctive spectrum of opportunities and challenges for investors.

## Categories of OTC Pink

Within the OTC Pink marketplace, there are three distinct categories based on the level of [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) provided by the companies. These categories are:

1. **Current Information**: Companies in this category provide the most [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and current information. They are typically better managed and undertake to meet the guidelines set by OTC Markets Group for providing [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md).

2. **Limited Information**: These companies have limited financial information available, which may not be up-to-date. They reach a minimum level of [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) but do not provide the same level of [transparency](../t/transparency.md) as those in the Current Information category.

3. **No Information**: Companies in this category provide no [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) information to the public. This segment is generally considered highly speculative and risky because investors have little to no insight into the company's operations, [financial health](../f/financial_health.md), or management.

## Benefits of OTC Pink

While the OTC Pink marketplace is often seen as riskier compared to major exchanges, it offers several benefits, including:

### Accessibility

OTC Pink provides a platform for companies that may not meet the [listing requirements](../l/listing_requirements.md) of larger exchanges. This accessibility fosters the growth of small and emerging companies, giving them the ability to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) and grow their operations.

### Lower Listing Costs

Listing on OTC Pink is significantly cheaper and simpler than listing on major exchanges. This cost-effective nature makes it an attractive option for smaller companies with limited financial resources.

### Diverse Investment Opportunities

Investors have the opportunity to explore a wide [range](../r/range.md) of investments, from promising startups to distressed companies that might have [turnaround](../t/turnaround.md) potential. This diversity enables investors to diversify their portfolios and seek potential high-reward opportunities.

## Risks Associated with OTC Pink

[Investing](../i/investing.md) in OTC Pink securities is inherently riskier than [investing](../i/investing.md) in securities [listed](../l/listed.md) on major exchanges. Several factors contribute to this increased [risk](../r/risk.md), including:

### Lack of Transparency

Many companies on OTC Pink do not provide regular or sufficient financial disclosures. This lack of [transparency](../t/transparency.md) makes it challenging for investors to make informed decisions and increases the [risk](../r/risk.md) of fraudulent activities like pump-and-dump schemes.

### Illiquidity

OTC Pink [stocks](../s/stock.md) are often thinly traded, leading to significant [illiquidity](../i/illiquid.md). This [illiquidity](../i/illiquid.md) can result in large [spreads](../s/spreads.md) between the [bid and ask](../b/bid_and_ask.md) prices and can make it difficult for investors to buy and sell [shares](../s/shares.md) without impacting the stock price.

### Volatility

The lack of regulation and lower level of oversight means that OTC Pink [stocks](../s/stock.md) can be subject to extreme price [volatility](../v/volatility.md). This [volatility](../v/volatility.md) can be both an opportunity for substantial gains and a [risk](../r/risk.md) for significant losses.

## Importance in Financial Markets

Despite the inherent risks, OTC Pink serves a vital role in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) by providing a platform for smaller and emerging companies to access [capital markets](../c/capital_markets.md). It is also an avenue for investors willing to undertake higher [risk](../r/risk.md) for higher potential returns. OTC Pink's existence ensures that a more inclusive and diverse financial ecosystem is maintained, catering to a [range](../r/range.md) of businesses and [investor](../i/investor.md) needs.

## Conclusion and Future Outlook

OTC Pink [will](../w/will.md) likely continue to play an essential role in the financial ecosystem, providing opportunities for both companies seeking to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) and investors looking for diverse and potentially high-[return](../r/return.md) investments. Technological advancements and improving regulatory frameworks may enhance [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and decrease some of the risks currently associated with trading on OTC Pink.

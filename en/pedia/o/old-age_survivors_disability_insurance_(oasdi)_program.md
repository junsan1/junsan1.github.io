# Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) Program

The Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program, also known as Social Security in the United States, is a crucial component of the federal government's social safety net. The program provides financial benefits to eligible workers and their families upon retirement, disability, or death.

## History and Background

The Social Security Act was signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on August 14, 1935. Initially designed to alleviate poverty among elderly Americans during the Great Depression, it has expanded over the years to include various forms of benefits for dependents and disabled workers.

## Funding Mechanism

The OASDI program is primarily funded through payroll taxes collected under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) and the Self-Employed Contributions Act (SECA). Employers and employees each pay 6.2% of wages, while self-employed individuals pay the entire 12.4%.

## Eligibility Criteria

### Retirement Benefits

Workers are eligible for retirement benefits if they have earned enough "credits" through their work history. As of 2023, earning $1,470 in covered earnings qualifies for one credit, and workers can earn up to four credits per year. Generally, workers need 40 credits (10 years of work) to be eligible for retirement benefits.

### Disability Benefits

Disability benefits are available to workers who have a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that prevents them from engaging in substantial gainful activity. The impairment must have lasted, or be expected to last, for at least 12 months or result in death.

### Survivors Benefits

Survivors benefits are available to family members, including spouses, children, and dependent parents, of deceased workers who had sufficient work history covered by Social Security.

## Benefit Calculation

### Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME)

The first step in calculating OASDI benefits is determining the worker's Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME). This is done by taking the worker's highest 35 years of earnings, adjusting for wage inflation, and averaging them on a monthly basis.

### Primary Insurance Amount (PIA)

The Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) is then calculated using a formula that applies different percentages to different portions of the AIME. The formula is designed to be progressive, meaning it provides a higher replacement rate for lower earners.

For example, in 2023:
- 90% of the first $1,115 of AIME
- 32% of the next $5,417 of AIME
- 15% of AIME over $6,532

### Cost-of-Living Adjustments (COLA)

OASDI benefits are adjusted annually based on changes in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) to ensure that the purchasing power of benefits is maintained over time.

## Claiming Strategies

### Early vs. Delayed Retirement

Benefits can be claimed as early as age 62 but will be permanently reduced compared to the full retirement age (FRA), which varies depending on the year of birth. Conversely, delaying benefits past the FRA increases the monthly benefit amount, up to age 70.

### Spousal and Survivor Benefits

Married individuals can choose to claim benefits based on their own work record or up to 50% of their spouse’s PIA, whichever is higher. Similarly, survivor benefits allow a widow or widower to receive up to 100% of the deceased spouse’s benefit.

## Financial Health and Future Outlook

### Trust Funds

The OASDI program operates through two trust funds: the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) Trust Fund and the Disability Insurance (DI) Trust Fund. These funds are managed by the Department of the Treasury.

### Actuarial Status

According to the 2023 Trustees Report, the OASDI program faces long-term financial challenges. The combined trust funds are projected to be depleted by 2034, at which point incoming payroll taxes would cover approximately 78% of scheduled benefits.

### Potential Reforms

Several proposals have been put forward to address the program's financial challenges, including:
- Raising the payroll tax rate
- Increasing the taxable wage base
- Adjusting the benefit formula
- Raising the full retirement age

## Conclusion

The Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program is a cornerstone of the U.S. social safety net, providing essential financial support to millions of Americans. Despite facing long-term financial challenges, it remains a critical source of income for retirees, disabled workers, and survivors. Addressing its financial health will require careful consideration of various policy options to ensure its sustainability for future generations.

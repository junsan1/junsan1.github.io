# Over-Line

In the context of trading and [finance](../f/finance.md), the term "Over-Line" may not be universally recognized by this exact phrasing. However, it can be closely related to certain financial expressions or [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). For the sake of this piece, I [will](../w/will.md) cover various pertinent topics, including [Over-The-Counter (OTC) trading](../o/over-the-counter_(otc)_trading.md), [margin](../m/margin.md) and borrowing lines, limit orders, and their relevance to [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) and fintech.

## Over-The-Counter (OTC) Trading

[Over-the-counter (OTC) trading](../o/over-the-counter_(otc)_trading.md) refers to financial securities traded directly between two parties instead of being traded on a formal [exchange](../e/exchange.md) like the New York Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (NYSE) or [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md). OTC trading forms a major part of the global [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and includes assets like [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), commodities, and currencies.

### Advantages of OTC Trading

1. **Flexibility:** OTC contracts can be tailored to meet the specific needs of the parties involved, including customization of terms such as [maturity](../m/maturity.md), size, and structure.
2. **Privacy:** Unlike [exchange](../e/exchange.md)-traded securities, OTC agreements are private and not publicly disclosed, making them attractive for traders desiring confidentiality.
3. **Accessibility:** OTC markets allow smaller companies to raise [capital](../c/capital.md), as they may not meet the stringent [listing requirements](../l/listing_requirements.md) of formal exchanges.

### Risks of OTC Trading

1. **[Counterparty Risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md):** Since OTC trades are bilateral agreements, there is a [risk](../r/risk.md) that one party may [default](../d/default.md) on its [obligations](../o/obligation.md), known as [counterparty risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md).
2. **Lack of [Transparency](../t/transparency.md):** The absence of centralized supervision can lead to less [market](../m/market.md) [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and greater price manipulation risks.
3. **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) Issues:** OTC markets might face lower [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) compared to formal exchanges, making it harder to buy or sell large positions without significant price changes.

### OTC Derivatives

OTC [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) are financial instruments that derive [value](../v/value.md) from an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) and are traded over the counter. They include swaps, [options](../o/options.md), and [forward contracts](../f/forward_contracts.md). These [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) play a crucial role in hedging, speculating, and [arbitrage opportunities](../a/arbitrage_opportunities.md).

## Margin and Borrowing Lines

In trading, the concept of [margin](../m/margin.md) refers to borrowing funds from a [broker](../b/broker.md) to purchase securities. A "borrowing line" or "[credit](../c/credit.md) line" is the amount of [money](../m/money.md) a [broker](../b/broker.md) is willing to lend, based on the [trader](../t/trader.md)'s account [equity](../e/equity.md) and [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md).

### Margin Trading

1. **[Initial Margin](../i/initial_margin.md):** The minimum amount required to [open](../o/open.md) a leveraged position. It usually represents a percentage of the total [trade](../t/trade.md) [value](../v/value.md).
2. **[Maintenance Margin](../m/maintenance_margin.md):** The minimum account [equity](../e/equity.md) required to maintain an [open position](../o/open_position.md). If the [equity](../e/equity.md) drops below this level, a [margin call](../m/margin_call.md) [will](../w/will.md) be issued.
3. **[Margin Call](../m/margin_call.md):** A [broker](../b/broker.md)'s [demand](../d/demand.md) to [deposit](../d/deposit.md) more funds or [liquidate](../l/liquidate.md) positions to meet the [maintenance margin](../m/maintenance_margin.md) requirement.

### Risks of Margin Trading

1. **[Leverage](../l/leverage.md) [Risk](../r/risk.md):** While [leverage](../l/leverage.md) amplifies potential returns, it also amplifies potential losses, making [margin trading](../m/margin_trading.md) highly risky.
2. **[Margin](../m/margin.md) Calls:** Sudden [market](../m/market.md) movements can trigger [margin](../m/margin.md) calls, forcing traders to [deposit](../d/deposit.md) additional funds or face position [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md).
3. **[Interest](../i/interest.md) Costs:** Borrowing [capital](../c/capital.md) incurs [interest](../i/interest.md) charges, which can add up over time and affect overall profitability.

## Limit Orders

A [limit order](../l/limit_order.md) is an [order](../o/order.md) to buy or sell a [security](../s/security.md) at a specified price or better. Unlike a [market order](../m/market_order.md) that executes immediately at the current [market price](../m/market_price.md), a [limit order](../l/limit_order.md) ensures that the [trade](../t/trade.md) only occurs at the desired [price level](../p/price_level.md), providing better control over [execution](../e/execution.md) prices.

### Types of Limit Orders

1. **[Buy Limit Order](../b/buy_limit_order.md):** An [order](../o/order.md) to buy a [security](../s/security.md) at a specified price or lower. It ensures that the [trader](../t/trader.md) does not pay more than the predetermined price.
2. **Sell [Limit Order](../l/limit_order.md):** An [order](../o/order.md) to sell a [security](../s/security.md) at a specified price or higher. It ensures that the [trader](../t/trader.md) does not sell for less than the desired price.

### Pros and Cons of Limit Orders

1. **Advantages:**
   - Price Control: Traders have greater control over the prices at which they enter or exit positions.
   - Reduced [Slippage](../s/slippage.md): Limit orders help reduce the [risk](../r/risk.md) of [slippage](../s/slippage.md), which occurs when actual [execution](../e/execution.md) prices differ from expected prices.

2. **Disadvantages:**
   - Non-Fill [Risk](../r/risk.md): There is a [risk](../r/risk.md) that limit orders may not be filled if the [market](../m/market.md) does not reach the specified price.
   - Partial Fills: In some scenarios, limit orders may be partially filled, leading to incomplete positions.

## Relevance to Algorithmic Trading and Fintech

### Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) refers to the use of computer algorithms to automate trading decisions, based on predefined criteria such as price, [volume](../v/volume.md), and time. It allows for high-speed, high-frequency [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) that are impossible to execute manually.

1. **[Execution Algorithms](../e/execution_algorithms.md):** These algorithms aim to execute large orders with minimal [market](../m/market.md) impact, optimizing the timing and splitting of orders.
2. **[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) Algorithms:** These exploit price differences between related financial instruments across different markets or exchanges.
3. **[Market Making Algorithms](../m/market_making_algorithms.md):** These provide [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) by continuously quoting buy and sell prices, earning profits from the [bid-ask spread](../b/bid-ask_spread.md).

### Fintech Integration

Fintech, short for financial technology, involves the use of technology to enhance financial services. Fintech innovations have revolutionized the trading landscape, providing novel solutions for traders and investors.

1. **Trading Platforms:** Advanced trading platforms [offer](../o/offer.md) real-time data, sophisticated trading tools, and seamless integration with brokers, empowering traders to make informed decisions.
2. **Robo-Advisors:** [Automated portfolio management](../a/automated_portfolio_management.md) services, called robo-advisors, use algorithms to build and manage investment portfolios based on individual [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) and goals.
3. **[Blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md):** [Blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology enables secure and transparent trading of digital assets, reducing [fraud](../f/fraud.md) and improving traceability.

# Order Types

In the realm of trading, understanding the various types of orders available to traders is crucial for effectively managing investments and mitigating risks. Different order types serve different purposes and are suited for various [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). Here, we will dive into the most commonly used order types in trading, explaining their functionalities, advantages, and potential disadvantages.

## Market Order

A market order is the simplest type of order. It is an order to buy or sell a security immediately at the current market price. The main objective of a market order is to ensure the execution of the trade as quickly as possible.

### Characteristics of Market Orders
- **Immediate Execution**: Executed at the best available current price.
- **Liquidity**: Market orders contribute to market liquidity.
- **No Price Guarantee**: The execution price may differ from the last traded price, especially in volatile markets.

### Advantages
- **Speed**: Ensures rapid execution of the trade.
- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and execute, making it suitable for beginners.

### Disadvantages
- **Price Slippage**: Executing at a different price than expected, particularly in volatile markets.
- **Lack of Control**: Traders cannot specify a price limit.

## Limit Order

A limit order is an order to buy or sell a security at a specific price or better. A [buy limit order](../b/buy_limit_order.md) can only be executed at the limit price or lower, while a sell limit order can only be executed at the limit price or higher.

### Characteristics of Limit Orders
- **Price Control**: Traders can set the maximum or minimum price at which they are willing to buy or sell.
- **Execution Uncertainty**: There is no guarantee that the order will be filled.

### Advantages
- **Price Control**: Protects against buying at too high and selling at too low prices.
- **Flexibility**: Traders can specify conditions under which the order should be executed.

### Disadvantages
- **Partial Fill**: The order may be partially filled if there isn’t enough liquidity at the specified price.
- **Non-[Execution Risk](../e/execution_risk.md)**: There is a risk that the order might not be executed if the market does not reach the specified price.

## Stop Order

A stop order, also known as a stop-loss order, is an order to buy or sell a security once its price reaches a specified level, known as the stop price. Once the stop price is reached, the stop order becomes a market order.

### Types of Stop Orders
- **[Buy Stop Order](../b/buy_stop_order.md)**: Placed above the current market price and is usually used to limit a loss or protect a profit on a short sale.
- **Sell Stop Order**: Placed below the current market price and is typically used to protect a long position.

### Advantages
- **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Helps limit losses or protect profits.
- **Automation**: Automatically becomes a market order once the stop price is triggered.

### Disadvantages
- **Price Slippage**: May be executed at a price different from the stop price in volatile markets.
- **Execution After Trigger**: The order will be executed regardless of price discrepancies once the stop price is hit.

## Stop-Limit Order

A stop-limit order combines features of a stop order and a limit order. It becomes a limit order once the stop price is reached, specifying a minimum price that must be met for the trade to be executed.

### Characteristics of Stop-Limit Orders
- **Two Prices Specified**: Includes both a stop price and a limit price.
- **Conditional Execution**: Order is subjected to both stop and limit conditions.

### Advantages
- **Controlled Execution**: Provides precision by setting both stop and limit prices.
- **Reduced Slippage**: Eliminates the risk of being executed at an unfavorable price.

### Disadvantages
- **Non-[Execution Risk](../e/execution_risk.md)**: The order may not be filled if the market price doesn’t reach the limit price.
- **Complexity**: More complex than standard stop or limit orders.

## Trailing Stop Order

A trailing stop order is a dynamic stop order that adjusts the stop price at a fixed percentage or dollar amount away from the market price as it moves in the trader’s favor.

### Characteristics of Trailing Stop Orders
- **Adjustment Mechanism**: The stop price moves along with price fluctuations.
- **Protection and Flexibility**: Protects profits by trailing the market price while capping potential losses.

### Advantages
- **Profit Preservation**: Locks in profits as prices move favorably.
- **Automatic Adjustment**: Automatically adapts to market conditions.

### Disadvantages
- **Complexity in Setup**: More complex to configure correctly.
- **Execution Uncertainty**: Similar risks to regular stop orders in volatile markets.

## Market-if-Touched (MIT) Order

A Market-if-Touched (MIT) order is an order to buy or sell a security at the best available price once a predetermined price level is reached. It becomes a market order when the specified price (the touch price) is hit.

### Characteristics of MIT Orders
- **Trigger Mechanism**: The transaction is triggered only after touching the specified price.
- **Immediate Execution Post-Trigger**: Converts to a market order upon triggering.

### Advantages
- **Conditional Execution**: Provides the advantage of conditional execution to buy or sell at favorable prices.

### Disadvantages
- **Price Risk Post-Trigger**: Similar to market orders, it may result in unfavorable price execution after the trigger.

## Fill or Kill (FOK) Order

A Fill or Kill (FOK) order is an order to buy or sell that must be executed immediately in its entirety; otherwise, the entire order is canceled.

### Characteristics of FOK Orders
- **Immediate Execution**: Must be filled completely at the time of placing the order.
- **All-or-Nothing Principle**: Either the entire order is filled instantly or it is canceled.

### Advantages
- **Execution Assurance**: Ensures that the trader does not end up with a partial fill.
- **Time Sensitivity**: Useful for time-sensitive trades requiring complete fills.

### Disadvantages
- **Execution Uncertainty**: Increased risk of non-execution due to the stringent requirements.

## Immediate or Cancel (IOC) Order

An Immediate or Cancel (IOC) order is an order to buy or sell that must be executed immediately. Any portion of the order that cannot be filled instantly is canceled.

### Characteristics of IOC Orders
- **Partial Fulfillment**: Allows partial execution, unlike FOK orders.
- **Quick Execution**: Must be filled within seconds of being placed.

### Advantages
- **Partial Execution**: Facilitates immediate trading while allowing partial fills.
- **Flexibility**: A more flexible alternative to FOK for obtaining quick fills.

### Disadvantages
- **Risk of Partial Fil**: May not fully meet the trader’s needs if not completely filled.

## Good till Date (GTD) Order

A Good till Date (GTD) order is an order that remains active until a specified date. If the order is not executed by this date, it is automatically canceled.

### Characteristics of GTD Orders
- **Expiry Condition**: Active until a specific expiry date.
- **Long-Term Planning**: Useful for executing trades over a longer time horizon.

### Advantages
- **Time Flexibility**: Provides a longer window for potential execution.
- **Strategic Execution**: Suitable for longer-term [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

### Disadvantages
- **Risk of Non-Execution**: If the market does not reach the desired price by the expiry date, the order will not be fulfilled.

## Good till Cancelled (GTC) Order

A Good till Cancelled (GTC) order remains active until the order is canceled by the trader. Unlike GTD orders, GTC orders do not have a defined expiry date.

### Characteristics of GTC Orders
- **Persistence**: Remains open indefinitely until canceled.
- **Longevity**: Suitable for trades where the trader can wait for an optimal price.

### Advantages
- **Execution Over Time**: Allows traders to wait for the market to move to their desired price levels.
- **Less Monitoring**: Requires less frequent monitoring compared to day or GTD orders.

### Disadvantages
- **Potential Oversight**: Traders might forget to cancel outdated orders.
- **Variable Market Conditions**: Market conditions may change, leading to unintended executions.

## Day Order

A day order is an order that is only valid for the trading day on which it is placed. If the order is not executed by the end of the trading day, it is automatically canceled.

### Characteristics of Day Orders
- **Same-Day Expiry**: Valid only for the trading day.
- **Temporal Limit**: Specific to the immediate [trading environment](../t/trading_environment.md).

### Advantages
- **Day-Trading Alignment**: Suitable for [intraday trading](../i/intraday_trading.md) strategies.
- **Automatic Cancellation**: Reduces the risk of unintended trades in the future.

### Disadvantages
- **Limited Execution Window**: If the market doesn’t reach the desired price, the order will not be executed.
- **Constant Monitoring**: Requires active monitoring by the trader during the trading day.

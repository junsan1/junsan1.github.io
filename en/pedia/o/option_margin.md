# Option Margin

In the realm of [finance](../f/finance.md) and trading, the term "option [margin](../m/margin.md)" refers to the amount of [capital](../c/capital.md) that an [investor](../i/investor.md) must [deposit](../d/deposit.md) to cover the [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) posed to a brokerage [firm](../f/firm.md) or [exchange](../e/exchange.md). [Options](../o/options.md) are [financial derivatives](../f/financial_derivatives.md) that provide traders with the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at a predetermined price before a specific date. This added flexibility and [leverage](../l/leverage.md) make [options](../o/options.md) an attractive tool for investors seeking to enhance their potential returns. However, with this potential for enhanced returns comes increased [risk](../r/risk.md), leading brokers to require a [margin](../m/margin.md) to mitigate potential losses.

## Overview of Options

[Options](../o/options.md) come in two primary forms: calls and puts. 

- **[Call Option](../c/call_option.md)**: This gives the holder the right to buy an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at a specified [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) before the [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md). 
- **[Put Option](../p/put.md)**: This provides the holder the right to sell an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at a specified [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) before the [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md). 

[Options](../o/options.md) can either be bought, meaning the [investor](../i/investor.md) has purchased the right conveyed by the option, or sold, meaning the [investor](../i/investor.md) has undertaken the obligation to fulfill the terms of the option should the buyer choose to [exercise](../e/exercise.md) it. 

## Margin Requirements

[Margin](../m/margin.md) requirements for [options](../o/options.md) are set by regulatory bodies, such as the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) and the Financial [Industry](../i/industry.md) Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in the United States. These requirements are also often supplemented by additional guidelines from individual brokerage firms. The purpose is to ensure that investors have sufficient [equity](../e/equity.md) to cover potential losses.

### Initial Margin

The [initial margin](../i/initial_margin.md) is the amount of [capital](../c/capital.md) that must be deposited to initiate a position. This [margin](../m/margin.md) must remain in place while the position is [open](../o/open.md) to cover potential losses.

### Maintenance Margin

[Maintenance margin](../m/maintenance_margin.md) refers to the minimum [equity](../e/equity.md) that must be maintained in the account. If the account [equity](../e/equity.md) falls below this level due to [market](../m/market.md) movements, the [investor](../i/investor.md) [will](../w/will.md) receive a [margin call](../m/margin_call.md) requiring the [deposit](../d/deposit.md) of additional funds to bring the [equity](../e/equity.md) back up to the required level.

## Margin for Long Options

When an [investor](../i/investor.md) buys a call or [put option](../p/put.md) (goes long), the [margin](../m/margin.md) requirements are straightforward. The [investor](../i/investor.md) pays the full [premium](../p/premium.md) of the option upfront, and no additional [margin](../m/margin.md) is required.

### Example Calculation for Long Options

Suppose an [investor](../i/investor.md) wants to buy a [call option](../c/call_option.md) for Company XYZ with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $100, expiring in one month. The [premium](../p/premium.md) for this option is $5 per share, and each option contract represents 100 [shares](../s/shares.md). Therefore, the total cost to buy one option contract is:

\[ 5 \times 100 = \$500 \]

This $500 is the total amount the [investor](../i/investor.md) must pay ([premium](../p/premium.md)), and no additional [margin](../m/margin.md) is required.

## Margin for Short Options

When an [investor](../i/investor.md) sells (writes) a put or [call option](../c/call_option.md), the [margin](../m/margin.md) requirements become more complex. This is because the potential losses can be significant, especially for uncovered (naked) [options](../o/options.md).

### Naked Option Writing

For [naked option writing](../n/naked_option_writing.md), the [margin](../m/margin.md) requirement is designed to cover the [risk](../r/risk.md) of the option being exercised and potentially resulting in a significant loss.

### Example Calculation for Uncovered Call Options

If an [investor](../i/investor.md) writes a naked [call option](../c/call_option.md) with the same parameters ([strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $100, [premium](../p/premium.md) of $5), the [margin](../m/margin.md) requirement calculation may involve several steps. A common formula used by brokerage firms is:

\[ Margin Requirement = (Premium Received + (20\% \times [Underlying](../u/underlying.md) Price) - (Out-of-the-[Money](../m/money.md) Amount)) \times 100 \]

If the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock is trading at $95:

\[ [Margin](../m/margin.md) Requirement = (5 + (0.20 \times 95) - (100 - 95)) \times 100 \]

\[ = (5 + 19 - 5) \times 100 \]

\[ = 19 \times 100 \]

\[ = \$1,900 \]

Therefore, the [investor](../i/investor.md) needs to maintain a [margin](../m/margin.md) of $1,900 for selling one naked [call option](../c/call_option.md).

### Covered Option Writing

Covered [options](../o/options.md) require a different approach as the corresponding [asset](../a/asset.md) or cash is held in the account to cover the potential obligation.

For covered calls, the [investor](../i/investor.md) already owns the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md). For covered puts, the [investor](../i/investor.md) has enough cash to buy the stock if needed.

### Example Calculation for Covered Call Options

Assume the [investor](../i/investor.md) owns 100 [shares](../s/shares.md) of Company XYZ, and each share is worth $100. The [investor](../i/investor.md) writes a [covered call](../c/covered_call.md) option with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $105 and receives a $3 [premium](../p/premium.md) per share. Since it's a [covered call](../c/covered_call.md), the [margin](../m/margin.md) requirement is satisfied by the ownership of the [shares](../s/shares.md).

\[ Value of [Shares](../s/shares.md) Held = 100 \times \$100 = \$10,000 \]

Since the [investor](../i/investor.md) is covered by the stock ownership, no additional [margin](../m/margin.md) is typically required other than the [premium](../p/premium.md) received.

## Portfolio Margin

Portfolio margining is a more advanced approach allowing greater [leverage](../l/leverage.md) based on the overall [risk](../r/risk.md) of the portfolio. It takes into consideration the combined [risk](../r/risk.md) of all positions under various [market](../m/market.md) conditions. This approach provides more sophisticated and active traders with the potential for lower [margin](../m/margin.md) requirements compared to traditional methods.

## Margin Calls

A [margin call](../m/margin_call.md) occurs when the [value](../v/value.md) of the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s account drops below the [maintenance margin](../m/maintenance_margin.md) level. When this happens, the brokerage [will](../w/will.md) [demand](../d/demand.md) that the [investor](../i/investor.md) [deposit](../d/deposit.md) additional funds or securities to cover the [margin](../m/margin.md) [shortfall](../s/shortfall.md). Failure to meet a [margin call](../m/margin_call.md) can result in the brokerage liquidating positions to bring the account back into compliance.

### Consequences of a Margin Call

- **Forced [Sale](../s/sale.md)**: The brokerage may sell some or all of the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s assets to cover the [margin](../m/margin.md) deficiency.
- **Account Suspension**: Trading privileges may be temporarily suspended until the [margin call](../m/margin_call.md) is resolved.
- **[Interest](../i/interest.md) Charges**: Brokers often charge [interest](../i/interest.md) on the [margin](../m/margin.md) balance, adding additional costs to the [investor](../i/investor.md).

## Conclusion

Option [margin](../m/margin.md) is an essential aspect of [options](../o/options.md) trading, designed to manage the [risk](../r/risk.md) and ensure that investors have sufficient [equity](../e/equity.md) to cover potential losses. It varies considerably depending on whether the [options](../o/options.md) are long or short, covered or uncovered. Understanding these requirements and the potential consequences of [margin](../m/margin.md) calls is crucial for any [investor](../i/investor.md) engaged in [options](../o/options.md) trading. By managing [margin](../m/margin.md) effectively, investors can mitigate risks and maximize their trading opportunities. More detailed guidelines and specifics can often be obtained from the brokerage firms, such as [Interactive Brokers](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/home.php) or [TD Ameritrade](https://www.tdameritrade.com/), that facilitate [options](../o/options.md) trading.

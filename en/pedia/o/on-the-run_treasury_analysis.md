# On-The-Run Treasury Analysis

## Introduction
On-the-run Treasury securities are the most recently issued U.S. Treasury bonds or notes of a particular maturity.

On-the-run Treasuries are critically important in financial markets for several reasons:

- **Usage:** Market participants such as hedge funds and [proprietary trading](../p/proprietary_trading.md) desks often use on-the-run Treasuries for hedging purposes because of their liquidity.

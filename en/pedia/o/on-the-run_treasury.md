# On-the-Run Treasury

## Introduction

In the realm of U.S. government [debt](../d/debt.md) securities, the term "On-the-Run Treasury" holds significant importance. On-the-Run Treasuries represent the most recently issued [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) bonds or notes of a particular [maturity](../m/maturity.md), making them the most current and [liquid](../l/liquid.md) securities in the Treasury [market](../m/market.md). These instruments play a crucial role in various financial and trading operations due to their [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), [transparency](../t/transparency.md), and role as [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) securities.

## Issuance of Treasuries

### Treasury Securities

The U.S. Department of the Treasury regularly issues various types of securities to [fund](../f/fund.md) government operations, including:
- **Treasury Bills (T-Bills)**: Short-term securities with maturities ranging from a few days to one year.
- **[Treasury Notes](../t/treasury_notes.md) (T-Notes)**: Medium-term securities with maturities of 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10 years.
- **Treasury Bonds (T-Bonds)**: Long-term securities with maturities ranging from 10 to 30 years.
- **Treasury [Inflation-Protected Securities](../i/inflation-protected_securities.md) (TIPS)**: Securities indexed to [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

### Auction Process

New Treasury securities are sold through a competitive bidding process in auctions conducted by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. These auctions determine the [yield](../y/yield.md) and price of the securities. The winning bids are allocated securities, which then become the "On-the-Run" issues.

## Characteristics of On-the-Run Treasuries

### Liquidity

On-the-Run Treasuries exhibit the highest [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) among all Treasury securities. They are actively traded in the [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md), allowing investors to buy and sell them quickly without significantly affecting the price.

### Benchmark Status

Due to their [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and consistent issuance, On-the-Run Treasuries serve as benchmarks for other [debt](../d/debt.md) securities and financial instruments. The yields on On-the-Run Treasuries are often used to gauge the [risk-free rate of return](../r/risk-free_rate_of_return.md), influencing pricing in a wide array of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

### Market Perception

These securities are perceived as being more attractive for trading purposes compared to their older counterparts, known as [Off-the-Run Treasuries](../o/off-the-run_treasuries.md). The heightened [demand](../d/demand.md) for On-the-Run Treasuries can lead to narrower [bid](../b/bid.md)-ask [spreads](../s/spreads.md) and better [execution](../e/execution.md) prices.

## Role in Financial Markets

### Yield Curve Construction

On-the-Run Treasuries are instrumental in constructing the U.S. [Treasury yield](../t/treasury_yield.md) curve, a graphical representation of yields across different maturities. The [yield curve](../y/yard.md) is a crucial tool for economists, investors, and policymakers, providing insights into [market](../m/market.md) expectations for [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md), and [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

### Risk Management

Financial institutions, such as banks and [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies, utilize On-the-Run Treasuries for managing [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md) and [liquidity risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md). These instruments [offer](../o/offer.md) a reliable [store of value](../s/store_of_value.md) and can be easily sold or used as [collateral](../c/collateral.md) in repurchase agreements (repos).

### Trading and Arbitrage

On-the-Run Treasuries are actively traded by institutional investors, [market](../m/market.md) makers, and [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds. Traders often engage in various strategies, including [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) between On-the-Run and Off-the-Run securities, exploiting price discrepancies due to [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) differences.

## Comparison with Off-the-Run Treasuries

### Liquidity and Pricing

[Off-the-Run Treasuries](../o/off-the-run_treasuries.md), which are older issues that have been replaced by newer ones, tend to be less [liquid](../l/liquid.md) and exhibit wider [bid](../b/bid.md)-ask [spreads](../s/spreads.md). This reduced [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) can result in slightly higher yields compared to On-the-Run Treasuries, as investors [demand](../d/demand.md) a [liquidity premium](../l/liquidity_premium.md).

### Use Cases

While On-the-Run Treasuries are preferred for trading and benchmarking, [Off-the-Run Treasuries](../o/off-the-run_treasuries.md) are often held by long-term investors seeking higher yields. These securities can also be used in certain fixed-[income](../i/income.md) strategies, such as [relative value](../r/relative_value.md) trading.

## Conclusion

On-the-Run Treasuries occupy a vital position in the U.S. [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), serving as a pillar of [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), [transparency](../t/transparency.md), and [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) pricing. Their role extends beyond simple [debt](../d/debt.md) instruments, influencing [yield curve construction](../y/yield_curve_construction.md), [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), and [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). Understanding the dynamics of On-the-Run Treasuries is crucial for investors, policymakers, and financial professionals navigating the complex landscape of government securities.

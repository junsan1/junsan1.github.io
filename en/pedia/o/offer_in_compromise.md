# Offer in Compromise

An [Offer](../o/offer.md) in Compromise (OIC) is a program that allows taxpayers to settle their tax [debt](../d/debt.md) for less than the full amount they owe. It is an available option when a [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) cannot pay their [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md) in full or doing so would create a financial hardship. The IRS considers an individual's ability to pay, [income](../i/income.md), expenses, and [asset](../a/asset.md) [equity](../e/equity.md) to determine if they [will](../w/will.md) accept the [offer](../o/offer.md). This program is essential for providing relief to those who are struggling with tax [obligations](../o/obligation.md) and ensures that taxpayers have an opportunity to settle their debts without facing undue financial strain.

## Eligibility Criteria

To qualify for an [Offer](../o/offer.md) in Compromise, the IRS considers various factors, including:

1. **Ability to Pay:** The IRS assesses your financial situation including all assets, monthly [income](../i/income.md), and living expenses to determine if you are able to pay the full tax [debt](../d/debt.md).
   
2. **[Income](../i/income.md):** Your current and future [income](../i/income.md) is also considered to evaluate your ability to settle the [debt](../d/debt.md).

3. **Expenses:** Necessary living expenses are taken into account to ensure you can meet basic living standards.

4. **[Asset](../a/asset.md) [Equity](../e/equity.md):** The [equity](../e/equity.md) in your assets, including property and vehicles, is evaluated.

Before proposing an OIC, the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) must have filed all necessary tax returns and made any required estimated payments. Any other [payment](../p/payment.md) plans with the IRS must also be up to date.

## Application Process

The process of applying for an [Offer](../o/offer.md) in Compromise involves several steps:

1. **Pre-Qualification:** The IRS provides an online tool that helps determine if you are eligible for an OIC. This tool considers factors such as [income](../i/income.md), expenses, and [asset](../a/asset.md) [equity](../e/equity.md).
   
2. **Form Submission:** The main form to submit for an OIC is Form 656, along with Form 433-A (for individuals) or Form 433-B (for businesses). Both forms require detailed financial information.
   
3. **Application [Fee](../f/fee.md) and Initial [Payment](../p/payment.md):** There is a non-refundable application [fee](../f/fee.md) ($205 as of 2023), and an initial [payment](../p/payment.md) must be made unless you qualify for a waiver due to low [income](../i/income.md).

4. **Review and [Negotiation](../n/negotiation.md):** Once the forms are submitted, the IRS reviews the application. They may request additional information and negotiate the [offer](../o/offer.md) terms.

5. **Acceptance and Compliance:** If the [offer](../o/offer.md) is accepted, you must comply with all the agreed terms including making the agreed payments and staying compliant with tax [obligations](../o/obligation.md) for a period typically five years.

## Types of Offers

There are three types of offers that the IRS might accept under the OIC program:

1. **Doubt as to [Liability](../l/liability.md):** This is when there is a genuine dispute about the amount of tax [debt](../d/debt.md) or whether the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) actually owes the [debt](../d/debt.md).

2. **Doubt as to Collectibility:** This is when the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md)'s assets and [income](../i/income.md) are insufficient to pay the full tax [debt](../d/debt.md).

3. **Effective Tax Administration:** This is when the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) can pay the full amount, but doing so would create an economic hardship or would be unfair and inequitable.

## Payment Options

When proposing an [Offer](../o/offer.md) in Compromise, taxpayers have two [payment](../p/payment.md) [options](../o/options.md):

1. **Lump Sum Cash [Offer](../o/offer.md):** This requires an initial [payment](../p/payment.md) of 20% of the total [offer](../o/offer.md) amount, with the balance to be paid in five or fewer installments after the [offer](../o/offer.md) is accepted.

2. **Periodic [Payment](../p/payment.md) [Offer](../o/offer.md):** This involves making monthly payments while the [offer](../o/offer.md) is being considered, with the balance to be paid within 24 months.

## Benefits and Drawbacks

### Benefits

1. **Relief from Tax [Debt](../d/debt.md):** Provides a way to settle the tax [debt](../d/debt.md) for less than the full amount owed.
   
2. **Avoidable Financial Hardship:** Helps taxpayers who cannot afford to pay the full [debt](../d/debt.md) without causing financial instability.
   
3. **Fresh Start:** Allows taxpayers to resolve their tax issues and get a fresh start with the IRS.

### Drawbacks

1. **Strict Criteria:** The IRS has stringent eligibility criteria, and not all requests are accepted.
   
2. **Long Process:** The application and review process can be lengthy, often taking several months to years.
   
3. **Non-refundable Payments:** The application [fee](../f/fee.md) and initial payments are non-refundable, even if the [offer](../o/offer.md) is rejected.

## Practical Considerations

1. **Detailed Financial [Disclosure](../d/disclosure.md):** Be prepared to disclose all financial information comprehensively; incomplete or incorrect forms can lead to delays or rejection.
   
2. **Professional [Guidance](../g/guidance.md):** Given the complexity, it is recommended to consult with a tax professional or attorney to determine eligibility and assist with the application.

3. **Stay Compliant:** Ensure you remain compliant with all tax filings and payments during the application process and afterward if the [offer](../o/offer.md) is accepted.

## Conclusion

An [Offer](../o/offer.md) in Compromise is a viable option for taxpayers facing significant financial challenges with their tax [obligations](../o/obligation.md). By negotiating with the IRS, eligible individuals can settle their tax [debt](../d/debt.md) for less than what they owe, allowing them to alleviate financial burdens and work towards financial stability.

# Options Trading Strategies

Options [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) are methods that traders employ to maximize their returns and minimize risks when trading options. Options are financial [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) that give traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price before a specified date. Unlike stocks, the value of options is derived from the value of another asset, such as stocks, indices, or commodities. This makes options trading both complex and strategically diverse. 

## Key Concepts in Options Trading

### Calls and Puts
- **Call Option**: Grants the holder the right to buy an underlying asset at a specified price within a specific period.
- **Put Option**: Grants the holder the right to sell an underlying asset at a specified price within a specific period.

### Option Premiums
The price paid for the option is known as the "premium." This is essentially the cost to purchase the option contract and is influenced by factors such as the underlying asset's price, the strike price, time to expiration, and market volatility.

### Strike Price
The strike price is the fixed price at which the holder of an option can buy (call) or sell (put) the underlying asset.

### Expiration Date
The date on which the option contract expires and becomes void. Options can have different durations, ranging from short-term (weeklies) to long-term (LEAPS).

### In-the-Money (ITM), Out-of-the-Money (OTM), and At-the-Money (ATM)
- **In-the-Money (ITM)**: Call options are ITM when the underlying asset's price is above the strike price; [put options](../p/put_options.md) are ITM when the underlying asset's price is below the strike price.
- **Out-of-the-Money (OTM)**: Call options are OTM when the underlying asset's price is below the strike price; [put options](../p/put_options.md) are OTM when the underlying asset's price is above the strike price.
- **At-the-Money (ATM)**: When the underlying assetâ€™s price is equal to the strike price for both call and [put options](../p/put_options.md).

## Popular Options Trading Strategies

### Covered Call
A covered call involves holding a long position in a stock and selling a call option on the same stock. This strategy generates income through the option premium but limits the upside potential if the stock price rises sharply.

### Protective Put
A protective put involves holding a long position in a stock and buying a put option on the same stock. This acts as an insurance policy, protecting the investor against significant declines in the stock price.

### Straddle
A straddle is created by buying both a call and a put option on the same stock with the same strike price and expiration date. This strategy can be profitable when the underlying asset experiences significant price movement in either direction.

### Strangle
A strangle involves buying a call and a put option with the same expiration date but different strike prices. Typically, the call option has a higher strike price and the put option has a lower strike price. This strategy is employed when a trader expects significant price movement but is uncertain of the direction.

### Bull Call Spread
This strategy involves buying a call option at a lower strike price and selling another call option at a higher strike price with the same expiration date. This limits both the potential gains and the potential losses.

### Bear Put Spread
This is similar to the [bull call spread](../b/bull_call_spread.md) but in the opposite direction. It involves buying a put option at a higher strike price and selling another put option at a lower strike price.

### Iron Condor
An [iron condor](../i/iron_condor.md) is a complex strategy that involves holding both a [bull put spread](../b/bull_put_spread.md) and a [bear call spread](../b/bear_call_spread.md). This strategy benefits from low volatility in the underlying asset's price and aims to capture small, consistent profits by trading within a certain price range.

### Butterfly Spread
A [butterfly spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md) combines a bull spread and a bear spread with three different strike prices. This strategy is employed when a trader expects minimal price movement in the underlying asset.

## Key Considerations

### Risk Management
Options trading can be risky, and it's crucial to employ strong [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) strategies. This involves setting [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md), diversifying trades, and never investing more than one can afford to lose.

### Market Conditions
Understanding current market conditions is essential. Strategies that work well in a volatile market might not be suitable for a stable market, and vice versa.

### Tax Implications
Options trading can have complex tax implications. It's important to understand how different types of options strategies are taxed and consult a tax professional if necessary.

# Options Trading Strategies

[Options](../o/options.md) [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) are methods that traders employ to maximize their returns and minimize risks when trading [options](../o/options.md). [Options](../o/options.md) are financial [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) that give traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at a predetermined price before a specified date. Unlike [stocks](../s/stock.md), the [value](../v/value.md) of [options](../o/options.md) is derived from the [value](../v/value.md) of another [asset](../a/asset.md), such as [stocks](../s/stock.md), indices, or commodities. This makes [options](../o/options.md) trading both complex and strategically diverse. 

## Key Concepts in Options Trading

### Calls and Puts
- **[Call Option](../c/call_option.md)**: Grants the holder the right to buy an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at a specified price within a specific period.
- **[Put Option](../p/put.md)**: Grants the holder the right to sell an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at a specified price within a specific period.

### Option Premiums
The price paid for the option is known as the "[premium](../p/premium.md)." This is essentially the cost to purchase the option contract and is influenced by factors such as the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price, the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md), time to expiration, and [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

### Strike Price
The [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) is the fixed price at which the holder of an option can buy (call) or sell (put) the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

### Expiration Date
The date on which the option contract expires and becomes void. [Options](../o/options.md) can have different durations, ranging from short-term (weeklies) to long-term (LEAPS).

### In-the-Money (ITM), Out-of-the-Money (OTM), and At-the-Money (ATM)
- **In-the-[Money](../m/money.md) (ITM)**: Call [options](../o/options.md) are ITM when the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price is above the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md); [put options](../p/put_options.md) are ITM when the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price is below the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).
- **Out-of-the-[Money](../m/money.md) (OTM)**: Call [options](../o/options.md) are OTM when the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price is below the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md); [put options](../p/put_options.md) are OTM when the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price is above the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).
- **At-the-[Money](../m/money.md) (ATM)**: When the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)â€™s price is equal to the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) for both call and [put options](../p/put_options.md).

## Popular Options Trading Strategies

### Covered Call
A [covered call](../c/covered_call.md) involves holding a long position in a stock and selling a [call option](../c/call_option.md) on the same stock. This strategy generates [income](../i/income.md) through the [option premium](../o/option_premium.md) but limits the [upside potential](../u/upside_potential_in_trading.md) if the stock price rises sharply.

### Protective Put
A [protective put](../p/protective_put.md) involves holding a long position in a stock and buying a [put option](../p/put.md) on the same stock. This acts as an [insurance](../i/insurance.md) policy, protecting the [investor](../i/investor.md) against significant declines in the stock price.

### Straddle
A [straddle](../s/straddle.md) is created by buying both a call and a [put option](../p/put.md) on the same stock with the same [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) and [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md). This strategy can be profitable when the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) experiences significant price movement in either direction.

### Strangle
A [strangle](../s/strangle.md) involves buying a call and a [put option](../p/put.md) with the same [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md) but different strike prices. Typically, the [call option](../c/call_option.md) has a higher [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) and the [put option](../p/put.md) has a lower [strike price](../s/strike_price.md). This strategy is employed when a [trader](../t/trader.md) expects significant price movement but is uncertain of the direction.

### Bull Call Spread
This strategy involves buying a [call option](../c/call_option.md) at a lower [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) and selling another [call option](../c/call_option.md) at a higher [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) with the same [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md). This limits both the potential gains and the potential losses.

### Bear Put Spread
This is similar to the [bull call spread](../b/bull_call_spread.md) but in the opposite direction. It involves buying a [put option](../p/put.md) at a higher [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) and selling another [put option](../p/put.md) at a lower [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).

### Iron Condor
An [iron condor](../i/iron_condor.md) is a complex strategy that involves holding both a [bull put spread](../b/bull_put_spread.md) and a [bear call spread](../b/bear_call_spread.md). This strategy benefits from low [volatility](../v/volatility.md) in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price and aims to capture small, consistent profits by trading within a certain price [range](../r/range.md).

### Butterfly Spread
A [butterfly spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md) combines a [bull spread](../b/bull_spread.md) and a [bear spread](../b/bear_spread.md) with three different strike prices. This strategy is employed when a [trader](../t/trader.md) expects minimal price movement in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

## Key Considerations

### Risk Management
[Options](../o/options.md) trading can be risky, and it's crucial to employ strong [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) strategies. This involves setting [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md), diversifying trades, and never [investing](../i/investing.md) more than one can afford to lose.

### Market Conditions
Understanding current [market](../m/market.md) conditions is essential. Strategies that work well in a volatile [market](../m/market.md) might not be suitable for a stable [market](../m/market.md), and vice versa.

### Tax Implications
[Options](../o/options.md) trading can have complex tax implications. It's important to understand how different types of [options](../o/options.md) strategies are taxed and consult a tax professional if necessary.

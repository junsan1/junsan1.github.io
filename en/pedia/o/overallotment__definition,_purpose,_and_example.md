# Overallotment: Definition, Purpose, and Example

## What is Overallotment?

Overallotment, often referred to as a "green shoe option," is a mechanism frequently used in securities offerings, particularly during initial public offerings (IPOs). This process allows underwriters to sell more shares than originally planned by the issuer, offering them the flexibility to manage oversubscription and stabilize the stock price post-IPO. The term "overallotment" itself denotes the allocation of shares exceeding the number initially set by the issuing company.

## Purpose of Overallotment

The primary purpose of overallotment is twofold:

1. **Stabilizing the Market Price**: If the IPO is in high demand and the stock price begins to soar uncontrollably, the underwriter can exercise the overallotment option to release additional shares into the market. This acts as a stabilizing mechanism to moderate price volatility and prevent a speculative bubble from forming shortly after the IPO.

2. **Covering Short Positions**: During the IPO process, underwriters might sell more shares than the amount initially allocated to them. This over-allocation entails selling short. If the stock price rises, the extra shares need to be covered by exercising the overallotment option, ultimately mitigating the risk for the underwriters and ensuring the market remains balanced.

## Example of Overallotment

Here is a practical example to understand how overallotment works:

### Illustration

Letâ€™s consider a company, XYZ Corp., planning to go public with an IPO. The company has planned to issue 1 million shares at a price of $20 per share. However, due to high investor interest, the demand exceeds expectations.

1. **Initial Allocation**: XYZ Corp. initially allocates 1 million shares.
2. **Overallotment Arrangement**: As part of the IPO agreement, an overallotment option of an additional 150,000 shares (15% of the original shares) is included.
3. **Underwriters' Action**: To meet the high demand, underwriters sell 1.15 million shares.

Depending on the post-IPO performance:

- **Stock Price Surges**: If the stock performs well and the market price rises above the $20 IPO price, the underwriters can exercise the overallotment option to purchase the extra 150,000 shares at the initial offer price, delivering them to investors without facing a loss.
- **Stock Price Declines**: If the stock price drops below the IPO price, the underwriters can buy back shares from the open market at a lower price rather than exercising the overallotment option. This activity helps equilibrate supply and demand, providing a cushion against price falls.

## Benefits and Risks of Overallotment

### Benefits

1. **Price Stabilization**: Overallotment helps in stabilizing the stock price after the IPO, preventing dramatic dips or spikes.
2. **Enhanced Flexibility**: It provides underwriters with tools to manage unexpected high demands efficiently.
3. **Market Confidence**: Supports a smooth trading environment, thereby fostering investor confidence in the stock.

### Risks

1. **Short-term Price Manipulation**: Critics argue that overly aggressive stabilization efforts can be a form of price manipulation, potentially misleading investors about a stock's true performance.
2. **Overreliance**: Companies might become reliant on overallotments to manage IPOs, neglecting other important financial policies.
3. **Regulatory Scrutiny**: Excessive use of overallotment and price stabilization measures can attract regulatory scrutiny from entities such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) due to concerns over market fairness.

## Conclusion

Overallotment serves as a crucial instrument in the IPO process, designed to stabilize the market and manage stocks' post-IPO performance effectively. Its strategic execution can greatly benefit both issuing companies and investors. However, it is essential for underwriters to use this option judiciously to avoid potential market disruptions and maintain regulatory compliance.

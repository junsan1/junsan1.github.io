# Ordinary Annuity

An ordinary annuity, also known as an annuity in arrears, is a financial product or arrangement where a series of equal payments is made at regular intervals over a specified period, with payments occurring at the end of each interval. This is in contrast to an [annuity due](../a/annuity_due.md), where payments are made at the beginning of each period. Ordinary annuities are prevalent in various [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md) and investment scenarios, such as retirement [income](../i/income.md) plans, [loan](../l/loan.md) repayments, and [insurance](../i/insurance.md) products.

## Characteristics of Ordinary Annuity

The defining characteristics of an ordinary annuity include:

1. **Fixed [Payment](../p/payment.md) Amounts**: Each [payment](../p/payment.md) in the series is of equal amount.
2. **Regular Intervals**: Payments are made at regular intervals, which can be monthly, quarterly, annually, etc.
3. **End of Period Payments**: Payments are made at the end of each interval period.
4. **Specified Term**: The annuity has a fixed term, which could [range](../r/range.md) from a few years to several decades.

## Types of Ordinary Annuities

Ordinary annuities can be classified into two broad categories based on their purpose and structure:

### Fixed Annuities

In fixed ordinary annuities, the [payment](../p/payment.md) amounts and the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) are predetermined and do not change over the annuity term. This provides investors with predictable [income](../i/income.md) and is often favored by those seeking stability and low-[risk](../r/risk.md) returns.

### Variable Annuities

Variable ordinary annuities [offer](../o/offer.md) payments that can fluctuate based on the performance of [underlying](../u/underlying.md) investments, such as mutual funds. These annuities provide the potential for higher returns but come with increased [risk](../r/risk.md), as payments are not guaranteed to remain consistent.

## Present Value and Future Value of Ordinary Annuities

### Present Value of an Ordinary Annuity (PVOA)

The [present value](../p/present_value.md) of an ordinary annuity is the current worth of a series of future payments, discounted at a specific [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md). The formula to calculate the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of an ordinary annuity is:

\[ PV = PMT \times \left(1 - \frac{1}{(1 + r)^n}\right) \div r \]

Where:
- \( PV \) = [Present Value](../p/present_value.md)
- \( PMT \) = [Payment](../p/payment.md) per period
- \( r \) = [Interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) per period
- \( n \) = Total number of payments

### Future Value of an Ordinary Annuity (FVOA)

The future [value](../v/value.md) of an ordinary annuity is the [value](../v/value.md) of the series of payments at a specified future date, taking into account [compound interest](../c/compound_interest_in_trading.md). The formula for calculating the future [value](../v/value.md) of an ordinary annuity is:

\[ FV = PMT \times \left(\frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r}\right) \]

Where:
- \( FV \) = Future [Value](../v/value.md)
- \( PMT \) = [Payment](../p/payment.md) per period
- \( r \) = [Interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) per period
- \( n \) = Total number of payments

## Comparing Ordinary Annuities to Annuity Due

An important distinction needs to be made between ordinary annuities and annuities due. While both involve a series of regular payments, they differ in the timing of these payments.

- **Ordinary Annuity**: Payments are made at the end of each period.
- **[Annuity Due](../a/annuity_due.md)**: Payments are made at the beginning of each period.

The timing difference affects the present and future values of the annuities. An [annuity due](../a/annuity_due.md) [will](../w/will.md) have a higher [present value](../p/present_value.md) and future [value](../v/value.md) compared to an ordinary annuity because each [payment](../p/payment.md) is invested for an additional period.

## Practical Applications of Ordinary Annuities

### Retirement Plans

Ordinary annuities are widely used in [retirement planning](../r/retirement_planning.md) to create a steady [income](../i/income.md) stream for retirees. For example, traditional pension plans often disburse monthly payments as ordinary annuities after retirement. These regular payments help retirees manage their living expenses during their non-working years.

### Loan Repayments

Loans and mortgages often follow the structure of an ordinary annuity. Borrowers make equal payments at the end of each period, usually monthly, which cover both the [interest](../i/interest.md) and the [principal](../p/principal.md) [repayment](../r/repayment.md). This consistent [payment](../p/payment.md) schedule helps borrowers plan their finances more effectively.

### Insurance Products

[Insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies [offer](../o/offer.md) annuity products that function as ordinary annuities. Policyholders pay premiums over a specified term, and upon [maturity](../m/maturity.md), they receive equal periodic payments. This setup provides a reliable source of [income](../i/income.md), especially in scenarios like life annuities or retirement annuities.

### Investment Strategies

Investors might use ordinary annuities as part of their investment portfolio to balance [risk](../r/risk.md) and generate sure [income](../i/income.md). Fixed ordinary annuities [offer](../o/offer.md) stability, while variable ordinary annuities provide potential for growth linked to [market](../m/market.md) performance.

## Risk Factors and Considerations

Despite their advantages, ordinary annuities come with certain [risk factors](../r/risk_factors_in_trading.md) and considerations that investors need to be aware of:

### Interest Rate Risk

The future [value](../v/value.md) of an ordinary annuity is influenced by the prevailing [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. A rise in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates can make the fixed payments less attractive compared to new investments with higher returns.

### Inflation Risk

[Inflation](../i/inflation.md) can erode the [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) of [fixed annuity](../f/fixed_annuity.md) payments over time, making them less valuable. Variable annuities can partially mitigate this [risk](../r/risk.md) if their returns keep pace with [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

### Liquidity Risk

Ordinary annuities typically have limited [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md). Early withdrawals might incur penalties, making it challenging for investors to access their funds if needed urgently.

### Credit Risk

The financial stability of the institution issuing the annuity is crucial. In the case of [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies, there is a [risk](../r/risk.md) that the [firm](../f/firm.md) might [default](../d/default.md) on its payments, especially during economic downturns.

## Conclusion

Ordinary annuities are versatile financial instruments that provide a reliable stream of [income](../i/income.md) over a fixed period. They are commonly used in [retirement planning](../r/retirement_planning.md), [loan](../l/loan.md) repayments, and various [insurance](../i/insurance.md) products. Understanding the [time value](../t/time_value.md) of [money](../m/money.md) and the calculations involved in determining the present and future values is critical for evaluating and making informed decisions about ordinary annuities. Investors should also consider the associated risks, such as [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md), [inflation](../i/inflation.md), [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), and [credit](../c/credit.md) risks, to ensure that their financial goals and [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) align with the characteristics of the chosen annuity.

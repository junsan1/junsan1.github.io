# Onerous Contract

An onerous contract in the context of [finance](../f/finance.md) and trading refers to an agreement in which the costs of meeting the [obligations](../o/obligation.md) specified by the contract outweigh the economic benefits derived from the contract itself. This may come to light particularly when a change in circumstances or [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [market](../m/market.md) conditions leads to a significant increase in costs or a decrease in the benefits. Onerous contracts can have substantial financial implications on companies and their [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md).

## Understanding Onerous Contracts

In [financial accounting](../f/financial_accounting.md), onerous contracts are defined under International [Accounting](../a/accounting.md) Standard (IAS) 37 "Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets." According to IAS 37, a contract becomes onerous when the unavoidable costs of fulfilling the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received. Unavoidable costs here refer to the lower amount of either the costs of fulfilling the contract or any penalties or compensation arising from failure to fulfill it.

### Key Characteristics

1. **Unavoidable Costs:** These are the direct costs that a [firm](../f/firm.md) [will](../w/will.md) incur to fulfill its contractual [obligations](../o/obligation.md).
2. **Benefits Exceed Cost:** The defining characteristic of an onerous contract is that the costs outweigh the benefits.
3. **Recognition of [Provision](../p/provision.md):** An entity is required to recognize a [provision](../p/provision.md) for onerous contracts in its [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) when a contract is identified as onerous.

### Common Scenarios Leading to Onerous Contracts

1. **[Supply Chain](../s/supply_chain.md) Disruptions:** Sudden increases in the cost of [raw materials](../r/raw_materials.md) or interruptions in [supply](../s/supply.md) chains can disproportionately increase the costs of fulfilling existing contracts.
2. **[Market](../m/market.md) Changes:** Rapid changes in [market](../m/market.md) conditions such as price crashes, [demand](../d/demand.md) reduction, or new regulations can turn profitable contracts into onerous ones.
3. **Cost Overruns:** In some cases, the originally estimated costs for a project can significantly exceed initial budgets due to inefficiencies or unforeseen issues.

## Financial Implications

### Impact on Financial Statements

Entities must address onerous contracts in their [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) through the recognition of a [provision](../p/provision.md):
- **[Income Statement](../i/income_statement.md):** The [provision](../p/provision.md) is usually recognized as an [expense](../e/expense.md), impacting the net [income](../i/income.md).
- **[Balance Sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md):** The [provision](../p/provision.md) is recorded as a [liability](../l/liability.md), affecting the companyâ€™s financial position.

### Provision Calculation

The [provision](../p/provision.md) must be measured at the lower of:
- The cost of fulfilling the contract, or
- The compensation or penalties arising due to non-fulfillment.

### Disclosure Requirements

IAS 37 mandates entities to disclose information about:
- The nature of the onerous contract.
- The expected timing of outflows of economic benefits.
- Any uncertainties about the amount or timing of those outflows.
- The carrying amount of the [provision](../p/provision.md).

### Examples in Financial Reporting

Major companies often report on onerous contracts in their [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md). For example:

- **BP (British [Petroleum](../p/petroleum.md))**: As part of their financial disclosures, energy companies like BP frequently report on provisions related to onerous contracts due to the volatile nature of energy markets ([BP Annual Report](https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/investors/results-and-reporting/annual-reporting.html)).
- **Airline [Industry](../i/industry.md):** Airlines like [Delta](../d/delta.md) Air Lines might recognize provisions for onerous contracts in their [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) due to fluctuations in fuel costs or sudden changes in travel [demand](../d/demand.md) ([Delta Air Lines Financials](https://ir.delta.com/financials/quarterly-results-and-statistics)).

## Risk Management and Mitigation

### Contract Clauses

To manage the [risk](../r/risk.md) of contracts becoming onerous, businesses may include specific clauses:
- **[Force Majeure](../f/force_majeure.md):** Allows the suspension of contractual [obligations](../o/obligation.md) under extraordinary events.
- **Escalation Clauses:** Adjust the contractual terms based on changes in input costs or [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

### Hedging Strategies

Firms may adopt [hedging strategies](../h/hedging_strategies.md) to manage the [risk](../r/risk.md) of cost increases:
- **[Forward Contracts](../f/forward_contracts.md):** Lock in prices for inputs or services.
- **[Options](../o/options.md):** Secure the right but not the obligation to buy inputs at a predetermined price.

### Scenario Analysis and Forecasting

Proactive [scenario analysis](../s/scenario_analysis.md) and regular cost [forecasting](../f/forecasting.md) can help identify potential onerous contracts early:
- **[Sensitivity Analysis](../s/sensitivity_analysis.md):** Assess the impact of various cost and [revenue](../r/revenue.md) changes on contracts.
- **[Stress Testing](../s/stress_testing.md):** Evaluate worst-case scenarios to understand the potential financial impact.

## Legal Remedies

When an onerous contract situation arises, businesses may explore several legal remedies:
- **Renegotiation:** Attempt to renegotiate the terms of the contract with the [counterparty](../c/counterparty.md).
- **Contract Termination:** If allowable under the contract terms, seek to terminate the contract.
- **Litigation:** As a last resort, companies may take legal action to resolve disputes related to onerous contracts.

## Conclusion

Onerous contracts present significant challenges for businesses, impacting their [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and strategic planning. Understanding the nature, risks, and financial implications of onerous contracts is crucial in managing their impact. Proactive [risk management techniques](../r/risk_management_techniques.md), legal strategies, and adequate financial reporting can help companies navigate the complexities of these challenging agreements.

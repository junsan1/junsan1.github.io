# Option Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (Option ARM)

An Option Adjustable-Rate [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md), commonly referred to as an Option ARM, is a type of adjustable-rate [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) that allows borrowers to choose among several different [payment](../p/payment.md) [options](../o/options.md) each month. These [options](../o/options.md) typically include a minimum [payment](../p/payment.md), which may result in [negative amortization](../n/negative_amortization.md), an [interest](../i/interest.md)-only [payment](../p/payment.md), and a traditional [principal](../p/principal.md) and [interest](../i/interest.md) [payment](../p/payment.md). Option ARMs became particularly popular during the housing boom of the early 2000s, but they are also considered one of the riskier [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) products due to their complexity and the potential for [negative amortization](../n/negative_amortization.md).

## How Option ARMs Work

Option ARMs [offer](../o/offer.md) borrowers the flexibility to select from different [payment](../p/payment.md) [options](../o/options.md), such as:

1. **Minimum [Payment](../p/payment.md)**: This is usually less than the [interest](../i/interest.md) charged on the [loan](../l/loan.md), leading to [negative amortization](../n/negative_amortization.md). The unpaid [interest](../i/interest.md) is added to the [principal](../p/principal.md), increasing the [loan](../l/loan.md) balance.
2. **[Interest](../i/interest.md)-Only [Payment](../p/payment.md)**: This covers only the [interest](../i/interest.md) charged for the month, not reducing the [principal](../p/principal.md).
3. **[Fully Amortizing Payment](../f/fully_amortizing_payment.md)**: This includes both [principal](../p/principal.md) and [interest](../i/interest.md) and is calculated to pay off the [loan](../l/loan.md) in the remaining term.
4. **Accelerated [Payment](../p/payment.md)**: This is a higher amount intended to pay off the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) faster, reducing the [loan](../l/loan.md) term.

Given the [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [payment](../p/payment.md) [options](../o/options.md), borrowers must manage the complexity and the [inherent risk](../i/inherent_risk.md) that comes with [negative amortization](../n/negative_amortization.md).

## Benefits and Risks 

### Benefits

1. **Flexibility**: Borrowers can tailor payments to their financial situation, making it easier to manage [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md).
2. **Lower Initial Payments**: The initial minimum payments may be considerably lower than traditional mortgages, appealing to those with short-term financial constraints.
3. **Potential for Growth**: If property values rise rapidly, the borrower might [gain](../g/gain.md) [equity](../e/equity.md) and [refinance](../r/refinance.md) to a more stable [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) product.

### Risks

1. **[Negative Amortization](../n/negative_amortization.md)**: Minimum payments can lead to an increasing [loan](../l/loan.md) balance, creating a scenario where the homeowner owes more than the house is worth.
2. **Rate Adjustments**: Option ARMs typically come with adjustable rates, which can rise significantly, leading to higher monthly payments after the initial period.
3. **Complexity**: The [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [payment](../p/payment.md) [options](../o/options.md) can be confusing, making it challenging for borrowers to track and understand their [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md) fully.

## Negative Amortization

[Negative amortization](../n/negative_amortization.md) occurs when the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [payment](../p/payment.md) is less than the [interest](../i/interest.md) charged on the [loan](../l/loan.md). This results in the unpaid [interest](../i/interest.md) being added to the [loan](../l/loan.md) balance. Over time, this can significantly increase the amount owed. For example, if the minimum [payment](../p/payment.md) covers only part of the [interest](../i/interest.md) due, the remaining [interest](../i/interest.md) is added to the [principal](../p/principal.md), leading to a growing [loan](../l/loan.md) balance, even though the borrower is making monthly payments.

## Adjustments and Caps

Option ARMs typically come with periodic adjustments to the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md). These adjustments can lead to changes in the monthly [payment](../p/payment.md) amounts. The initial [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) is often a "teaser" rate, which is lower for a short period and then adjusts to a higher rate. 

Lenders typically set caps on how much the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) can change, either per adjustment period or over the life of the [loan](../l/loan.md). There are different types of caps:

1. **Periodic Rate Caps**: Limit how much the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) can increase or decrease during each adjustment period.
2. **Lifetime Caps**: Set a maximum limit on how much the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) can increase over the life of the [loan](../l/loan.md).
3. **[Payment](../p/payment.md) Caps**: Limit how much the monthly [payment](../p/payment.md) can increase per adjustment period, but may not fully cover changes in the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md), leading to [deferred interest](../d/deferred_interest.md) and potential [negative amortization](../n/negative_amortization.md).

## Impact on Borrowers

For many borrowers, the complexity and potential for [negative amortization](../n/negative_amortization.md) with Option ARMs led to financial strain. Understanding the total impact of making minimum payments, potential rate increases, and caps is crucial. During the housing [market](../m/market.md) downturn, many found that escalating [loan](../l/loan.md) balances and increased payments pushed them into [foreclosure](../f/foreclosure.md).

## Regulatory Responses

Due to the negative outcomes for many borrowers, Option ARMs have come under regulatory scrutiny. Various regulations were introduced to protect consumers from high-[risk](../r/risk.md) [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) products. Lenders are now required to provide more transparent disclosures and ensure that borrowers can afford the [loan](../l/loan.md) terms even after rate adjustments.

## Real-world Examples

One of the most notable instances of Option ARMs adversely impacting borrowers was during the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) of 2007-2008. The housing [market](../m/market.md) collapse saw numerous homeowners with Option ARMs facing [payment](../p/payment.md) shock when their [interest](../i/interest.md) rates reset. Payments that were manageable at the teaser rates became unsustainable, leading to a wave of defaults and foreclosures.

## Conclusion

Option Adjustable-Rate Mortgages [offer](../o/offer.md) flexibility and lower initial payments but come with significant risks, particularly the potential for [negative amortization](../n/negative_amortization.md). The complexity of the product requires careful consideration and thorough understanding by the borrower. Due to their inherent risks, these [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) products are less commonly offered today, and tighter regulations have been implemented to protect consumers.

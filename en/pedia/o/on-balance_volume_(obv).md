# On-Balance Volume (OBV)

## Introduction
On-Balance [Volume](../v/volume.md) (OBV) is a [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) [indicator](../i/indicator.md) that forecasts the price movement of assets by measuring the buying and selling pressure. The OBV was developed by Joe Granville and introduced in his 1963 book "Granville's New Key to [Stock Market](../s/stock_market.md) Profits." It has since become a widely utilized tool among traders to identify trends and predict price movements in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

## Definition of OBV
The On-Balance [Volume](../v/volume.md) [indicator](../i/indicator.md) accumulates [volume](../v/volume.md) data and adds or subtracts the daily [volume](../v/volume.md) depending on the closing price movement. If the closing price of a stock or [commodity](../c/commodity.md) increases, the [volume](../v/volume.md) for that day is added to the cumulative OBV. Conversely, if the closing price decreases, the [volume](../v/volume.md) for that day is subtracted. This accumulation delivers a running total of trading [volume](../v/volume.md) that provides insights into the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) strength of price movements.

## Calculation of OBV
The OBV calculation formula is straightforward:
- If the closing price today is higher than the closing price yesterday:
  - `OBV_today = OBV_yesterday + Volume_today`
- If the closing price today is lower than the closing price yesterday:
  - `OBV_today = OBV_yesterday - Volume_today`
- If the closing prices are the same:
  - `OBV_today = OBV_yesterday`

The key to understanding OBV is recognizing how the shifts in [volume](../v/volume.md) can signal potential price moves. As the cumulative OBV rises or falls, it provides early warning signs, potentially ahead of actual price movements.

## Interpretation of OBV
### Rising OBV
A rising OBV typically signifies that buying pressure ([volume](../v/volume.md)) is outpacing selling pressure, indicating a bullish [trend](../t/trend.md). As the [volume](../v/volume.md) accumulates with higher prices, it validates the [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md) and suggests that the optimism among investors is growing.

### Falling OBV
Conversely, a falling OBV suggests that selling pressure exceeds buying pressure, marking a bearish [trend](../t/trend.md). When the [volume](../v/volume.md) diminishes with dropping prices, it reveals that investors are becoming pessimistic, and it might signal an impending [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md).

### Divergence
[Divergence](../d/divergence.md) between OBV and price can be a critical [indicator](../i/indicator.md):
- **[Bullish Divergence](../b/bullish_divergence.md):** Occurs when the price makes new lows but the OBV does not follow suit and makes higher lows. This can indicate an upcoming price [reversal](../r/reversal.md) to the [upside](../u/upside.md).
- **[Bearish Divergence](../b/bearish_divergence.md):** Occurs when the price makes new highs, but the OBV does not make corresponding new highs, signaling potential price [reversal](../r/reversal.md) to the downside.

## Applications of OBV
### Trend Confirmation
OBV can be used to confirm the strength of a [trend](../t/trend.md):
- When the price is in an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md), and OBV is also trending upwards, it confirms the [trend](../t/trend.md)'s strength.
- Similarly, a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md) accompanied by a declining OBV confirms the prevailing [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md).

### Predicting Breakouts
Traders often use OBV to predict price breakouts. For instance, a substantial increase in OBV when the price is consolidating might indicate an imminent [breakout](../b/breakout.md). Once the price breaks out, the OBV's cumulative [volume](../v/volume.md) can reinforce the validity of the [breakout](../b/breakout.md).

### Volume-Based Analysis in Different Markets
OBV is versatile and can be applied across various [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), including [stocks](../s/stock.md), commodities, and cryptocurrencies. Its ability to distinguish genuine price movements from potential [false signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md) makes it valuable for [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [asset](../a/asset.md) classes.

## Advantages of OBV
- **Simplicity:** The OBV is relatively easy to calculate and interpret, making it accessible to novice traders.
- **Early Signals:** The OBV can often provide early warning signals before price movements, giving traders a timely edge.
- **[Volume](../v/volume.md) Insight:** By focusing on [volume](../v/volume.md), OBV highlights the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) strength or weakness that might not be visible just from [price action](../p/price_action.md).

## Disadvantages of OBV
- **Sensitivity to Skew:** OBV might be overly sensitive to high or low [volume](../v/volume.md) days, which can cause misleading signals.
- **[False Signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md):** Significant [volume](../v/volume.md) spikes due to one-off events might distort the OBV, leading to potential [false signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md).
- **Supplementary Tool:** OBV should be used in conjunction with other [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) for better reliability, as it might not always be accurate on its own.

## Practical Example
Consider a hypothetical stock XYZ. On Monday, the stock closes at $100 with a [volume](../v/volume.md) of 1,000,000 [shares](../s/shares.md). On Tuesday, the price increases to $105 with a [volume](../v/volume.md) of 1,200,000 [shares](../s/shares.md). The OBV calculation for these two days would be:
- Monday: OBV = 1,000,000 (since it's the first day, we start at the [volume](../v/volume.md) [value](../v/value.md))
- Tuesday: OBV = 1,000,000 + 1,200,000 = 2,200,000

Suppose on Wednesday, the stock closes at $103 with a [volume](../v/volume.md) of 900,000 [shares](../s/shares.md):
- Wednesday: OBV = 2,200,000 - 900,000 = 1,300,000

This example demonstrates how OBV adjusts with price changes and [volume](../v/volume.md), accumulating to reflect the overall buying and selling pressure.

## Case Studies
### Google (Alphabet Inc.)
Let's consider Google (Alphabet Inc.) as a case study for OBV application. Suppose a [trader](../t/trader.md) notices that the stock price has been rising steadily but the OBV has started to fall. This [divergence](../d/divergence.md) might signal that buying pressure is weakening, and a potential price [correction](../c/correction.md) could be forthcoming.

### Tesla Inc.
On the other hand, consider Tesla Inc., where the stock price is in a [consolidation](../c/consolidation.md) phase, moving sideways. If the OBV starts to increase significantly during this period without a corresponding price rise, it might hint at an impending upward [breakout](../b/breakout.md).

## Companies Utilizing OBV
Many [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds and trading firms integrate OBV into their automated [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) to enhance the prediction accuracy of their models. Companies like Renaissance Technologies ([Renaissance Technologies](https://www.rentec.com/)) and Two Sigma ([Two Sigma](https://www.twosigma.com/)) are known for their advanced [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) strategies, which may incorporate [volume](../v/volume.md)-based indicators such as OBV.

## Conclusion
On-Balance [Volume](../v/volume.md) (OBV) is a powerful tool in [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) that provides valuable insights into price movements by focusing on [volume](../v/volume.md) data. Despite its limitations, OBV remains a popular [indicator](../i/indicator.md) due to its simplicity and effectiveness in [forecasting](../f/forecasting.md) trends. When used alongside other [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md), OBV can significantly enhance [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) and decision-making processes, ultimately supporting traders in navigating the complexities of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

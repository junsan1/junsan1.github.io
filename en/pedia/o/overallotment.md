# Overallotment

## What is Overallotment?

Overallotment, often referred to as a "green shoe option," is a mechanism frequently used in securities offerings, particularly during initial public offerings (IPOs). This process allows underwriters to sell more [shares](../s/shares.md) than originally planned by the [issuer](../i/issuer.md), [offering](../o/offering.md) them the flexibility to manage oversubscription and stabilize the stock price post-IPO. The term "overallotment" itself denotes the allocation of [shares](../s/shares.md) exceeding the number initially set by the issuing company.

## Purpose of Overallotment

The primary purpose of overallotment is twofold:

1. **Stabilizing the [Market Price](../m/market_price.md)**: If the IPO is in high [demand](../d/demand.md) and the stock price begins to soar uncontrollably, the [underwriter](../u/underwriter.md) can [exercise](../e/exercise.md) the overallotment option to release additional [shares](../s/shares.md) into the [market](../m/market.md). This acts as a stabilizing mechanism to moderate price [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and prevent a speculative bubble from forming shortly after the IPO.

2. **Covering Short Positions**: During the IPO process, underwriters might sell more [shares](../s/shares.md) than the amount initially allocated to them. This over-allocation entails selling short. If the stock price rises, the extra [shares](../s/shares.md) need to be covered by exercising the overallotment option, ultimately mitigating the [risk](../r/risk.md) for the underwriters and ensuring the [market](../m/market.md) remains balanced.

## Example of Overallotment

Here is a practical example to understand how overallotment works:

### Illustration

Letâ€™s consider a company, XYZ Corp., planning to go public with an IPO. The company has planned to [issue](../i/issue.md) 1 million [shares](../s/shares.md) at a price of $20 per share. However, due to high [investor](../i/investor.md) [interest](../i/interest.md), the [demand](../d/demand.md) exceeds expectations.

1. **Initial Allocation**: XYZ Corp. initially allocates 1 million [shares](../s/shares.md).
2. **Overallotment Arrangement**: As part of the IPO agreement, an overallotment option of an additional 150,000 [shares](../s/shares.md) (15% of the original [shares](../s/shares.md)) is included.
3. **Underwriters' Action**: To meet the high [demand](../d/demand.md), underwriters sell 1.15 million [shares](../s/shares.md).

Depending on the post-IPO performance:

- **Stock Price Surges**: If the stock performs well and the [market price](../m/market_price.md) rises above the $20 IPO price, the underwriters can [exercise](../e/exercise.md) the overallotment option to purchase the extra 150,000 [shares](../s/shares.md) at the initial [offer](../o/offer.md) price, delivering them to investors without facing a loss.
- **Stock Price Declines**: If the stock price drops below the IPO price, the underwriters can buy back [shares](../s/shares.md) from the [open market](../o/open_market.md) at a lower price rather than exercising the overallotment option. This activity helps equilibrate [supply](../s/supply.md) and [demand](../d/demand.md), providing a cushion against price falls.

## Benefits and Risks of Overallotment

### Benefits

1. **Price Stabilization**: Overallotment helps in stabilizing the stock price after the IPO, preventing dramatic dips or spikes.
2. **Enhanced Flexibility**: It provides underwriters with tools to manage unexpected high demands efficiently.
3. **[Market](../m/market.md) Confidence**: Supports a smooth [trading environment](../t/trading_environment.md), thereby fostering [investor](../i/investor.md) confidence in the stock.

### Risks

1. **Short-term Price Manipulation**: Critics argue that overly aggressive stabilization efforts can be a form of price manipulation, potentially misleading investors about a stock's true performance.
2. **Overreliance**: Companies might become reliant on overallotments to manage IPOs, neglecting other important financial policies.
3. **Regulatory Scrutiny**: Excessive use of overallotment and price stabilization measures can attract regulatory scrutiny from entities such as the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) due to concerns over [market](../m/market.md) fairness.

## Conclusion

Overallotment serves as a crucial instrument in the IPO process, designed to stabilize the [market](../m/market.md) and manage [stocks](../s/stock.md)' post-IPO performance effectively. Its strategic [execution](../e/execution.md) can greatly benefit both issuing companies and investors. However, it is essential for underwriters to use this option judiciously to avoid potential [market](../m/market.md) disruptions and maintain regulatory compliance.

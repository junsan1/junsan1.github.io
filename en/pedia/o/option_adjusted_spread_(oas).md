# Option Adjusted Spread (OAS)

The Option Adjusted Spread (OAS) is a measurement used in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) to assess the [yield](../y/yield.md) differential between a [fixed-income security](../f/fixed-income_security.md) like a [bond](../b/bond.md) and the corresponding [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate, while [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for the embedded [options](../o/options.md) within the [bond](../b/bond.md). This metric is crucial for investors and portfolio managers looking to understand the true [yield](../y/yield.md) of an investment relative to its inherent risks, especially when the [bond](../b/bond.md) includes features such as call or [put options](../p/put_options.md).

### Basics of Fixed-Income Securities

Fixed-[income](../i/income.md) securities are investment instruments that provide returns in the form of regular, fixed [interest](../i/interest.md) payments and the eventual [return](../r/return.md) of [principal](../p/principal.md) at [maturity](../m/maturity.md). These securities include bonds, treasury bills, and other forms of [debt](../d/debt.md) instruments. The primary appeal of fixed-[income](../i/income.md) securities is their relative stability and predictability of returns.

### Understanding the Yield Spread

The [yield spread](../y/yield_spread.md) is the difference between the [yield](../y/yield.md) on a [fixed-income security](../f/fixed-income_security.md) and the [yield](../y/yield.md) on a [risk](../r/risk.md)-free [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md), such as [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) bonds. This spread compensates investors for the additional risks associated with the non-[risk](../r/risk.md)-free [security](../s/security.md), including [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md), [liquidity risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md), and other factors.

### Embedded Options in Bonds

Many bonds come with [options](../o/options.md) embedded in their structure. Common types of embedded [options](../o/options.md) include:

1. **Call [Options](../o/options.md)**: Allow the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) to repurchase the [bond](../b/bond.md) before its [maturity date](../m/maturity_date.md) at a predetermined price.
2. **[Put Options](../p/put_options.md)**: Give the [bondholder](../b/bondholder.md) the right to sell the [bond](../b/bond.md) back to the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) before [maturity](../m/maturity.md) at a predetermined price.
3. **Convertible [Options](../o/options.md)**: Enable the [bondholder](../b/bondholder.md) to convert the [bond](../b/bond.md) into a predefined number of [shares](../s/shares.md) of the [issuer](../i/issuer.md)'s [equity](../e/equity.md).

These [options](../o/options.md) add complexity to the [valuation](../v/valuation.md) of bonds because they introduce additional risks and rewards that must be accounted for.

### Calculation of Option Adjusted Spread (OAS)

The OAS adjusts the [nominal](../n/nominal.md) spread between the [bond yield](../b/bond_yield.md) and the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate to remove the influence of the embedded [options](../o/options.md). This adjustment allows for a more meaningful comparison between various bonds and securities with different embedded [options](../o/options.md).

#### Steps to Calculate OAS:

1. **Model the [Bond](../b/bond.md)'s Cash Flows**: Estimate the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s expected cash flows, including coupon payments and [principal](../p/principal.md) [repayment](../r/repayment.md), [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for the likelihood of the [options](../o/options.md) being exercised.
2. **[Discounting](../d/discounting.md) Cash Flows**: Use an [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) model to [discount](../d/discount.md) these cash flows at varying rates across different scenarios, reflecting the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and the timing of potential option exercises.
3. **Compute the [Nominal](../n/nominal.md) Spread**: Determine the [nominal](../n/nominal.md) [yield spread](../y/yield_spread.md) of the [bond](../b/bond.md) over a [risk](../r/risk.md)-free [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md).
4. **Adjust for Embedded [Options](../o/options.md)**: Subtract the additional [yield](../y/yield.md) provided by the embedded [options](../o/options.md) from the [nominal](../n/nominal.md) [yield spread](../y/yield_spread.md) to arrive at the OAS.

The resulting OAS represents the [yield](../y/yield.md) differential attributable solely to [credit](../c/credit.md) and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) risks, excluding the distortion from [options](../o/options.md).

### Applications of OAS

The OAS is extensively used by professional investors, including portfolio managers, traders, and analysts, for various applications:

1. **[Comparative Analysis](../c/comparative_analysis.md)**: By isolating the impact of embedded [options](../o/options.md), investors can more accurately compare bonds with different structure and [risk profiles](../r/risk_profiles.md).
2. **[Valuation](../v/valuation.md) and Pricing**: OAS helps in pricing bonds more precisely by removing the complexity added by embedded [options](../o/options.md).
3. **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Assessment**: Investors can better assess the [credit](../c/credit.md) and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) risks of a [bond](../b/bond.md) by focusing on the OAS.
4. **Performance Measurement**: Portfolio managers use OAS to evaluate the performance of fixed-[income](../i/income.md) portfolios, ensuring that they are compensated appropriately for the risks taken.

### Advantages of Using OAS

1. **Holistic View of [Yield](../y/yield.md)**: OAS provides a more complete and accurate representation of a [bond](../b/bond.md)'s [yield](../y/yield.md) after [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for embedded [options](../o/options.md).
2. **Improved Decision Making**: By using OAS, investors can make more informed decisions regarding [bond](../b/bond.md) investments.
3. **Better [Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: OAS allows for a clearer assessment of the risks inherent in bonds, leading to better [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices.

### Limitations of OAS

1. **Complexity**: Calculating OAS involves complex [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md) and assumptions, which can be a barrier for some investors.
2. **Model Dependency**: The accuracy of OAS calculations depends heavily on the [interest rate models](../i/interest_rate_models.md) and assumptions used.

A number of financial institutions and analytics firms specialize in the calculation and analysis of OAS:

1. **[Bloomberg](../b/bloomberg.md) L.P.**: Provides comprehensive financial data and analytics tools for calculating OAS. (https://www.[bloomberg](../b/bloomberg.md).com)

### Conclusion

The Option Adjusted Spread is a vital tool in the realm of fixed-[income](../i/income.md) investment. By providing a [yield](../y/yield.md) measurement that accounts for the intricacies of embedded [options](../o/options.md), OAS allows investors to make more accurate and informed decisions, enhancing their ability to manage [risk](../r/risk.md) and optimize portfolios. Despite its complexity, the benefits of incorporating OAS into fixed-[income](../i/income.md) analysis outweigh the challenges, making it an indispensable metric in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

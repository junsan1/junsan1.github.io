# Optionable Stock

Optionable [stocks](../s/stock.md), also known as [options](../o/options.md)-eligible [stocks](../s/stock.md), are equities that have [options](../o/options.md) [listed](../l/listed.md) for trading on recognized [options](../o/options.md) markets. These include publicly-traded [shares](../s/shares.md) of a company for which [market](../m/market.md) participants can buy and sell [options](../o/options.md). The ability to [trade](../t/trade.md) [options](../o/options.md) on a stock significantly enhances its trading opportunities and potential strategies for traders. [Options](../o/options.md) are [financial derivatives](../f/financial_derivatives.md) that give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to purchase or sell the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at a predetermined price before the contract expires. Below is a detailed exploration of optionable [stocks](../s/stock.md), their characteristics, significance in trading, methods to identify them, and the impact they have on the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

## Characteristics of Optionable Stocks

### Liquidity
One primary characteristic of optionable [stocks](../s/stock.md) is their considerable [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md). For a stock to be optionable, it must exhibit a high level of trading activity, ensuring that there's sufficient [interest](../i/interest.md) and [trade](../t/trade.md) [volume](../v/volume.md) among investors. [Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) is crucial because it facilitates smoother transactions at competitive prices, minimizing the spread between [bid and ask](../b/bid_and_ask.md) prices and reducing the impact of large orders on the stock's price.

### Market Capitalization
Typically, optionable [stocks](../s/stock.md) come from companies with sizable [market](../m/market.md) capitalizations, often falling into the large-cap or [mid-cap](../m/mid-cap.md) categories. This is because larger companies are generally more stable, well-known, and followed by analysts, which ensures the [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) required for an active [options](../o/options.md) [market](../m/market.md).

### Regulations and Standards
The listing of stock [options](../o/options.md) is subject to regulatory standards and guidelines established by [options](../o/options.md) exchanges and securities regulators. For example, in the United States, the [Options](../o/options.md) [Clearing](../c/clearing.md) [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) (OCC) and exchanges such as the Chicago Board [Options](../o/options.md) [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (CBOE) govern the listing and trading of [options](../o/options.md). They impose criteria regarding the stock's price history, trading [volume](../v/volume.md), and [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md).

## Types of Options in Optionable Stocks

### Call Options
A [call option](../c/call_option.md) gives the holder the right, without any obligation, to purchase the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock at a specified [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) within a predefined period. If the stock's price increases above the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md), the holder can [exercise](../e/exercise.md) the option to buy the stock at the lower [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) and potentially sell it at the [market price](../m/market_price.md), thus realizing a [profit](../p/profit.md).

### Put Options
Conversely, a [put option](../p/put.md) grants the holder the right, again without obligation, to sell the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock at a specified [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) within a set period. If the stock's price falls below the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md), the [put option](../p/put.md) holder can sell the stock at the higher [strike price](../s/strike_price.md), profiting from the difference.

## Identifying Optionable Stocks

### Stock Screeners
Investors use stock screeners to identify optionable [stocks](../s/stock.md), filtering equities based on criteria such as [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md), [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), and trading [volume](../v/volume.md). Many financial websites and trading platforms, such as [Yahoo Finance](../y/yahoo_finance.md), [Bloomberg](../b/bloomberg.md), and [E*TRADE](../e/e_trade.md), provide screener tools.

### Options Chains
[Options](../o/options.md) chains display all available call and [put options](../p/put_options.md) for an optionable stock, detailing various strike prices and expiration dates. Traders can access these chains on brokerage platforms and financial news websites, aiding them in analyzing and choosing the most suitable [options](../o/options.md) for their strategies.

### Exchange Listings
[Options](../o/options.md) exchanges like the CBOE and NYSE American maintain lists of optionable [stocks](../s/stock.md), often available on their websites. For instance, the CBOE provides resources on its website for traders to explore optionable [stocks](../s/stock.md) and relevant data: [CBOE Optionable Stocks](https://www.cboe.com).

## Advantages of Trading Optionable Stocks

### Leverage
[Options](../o/options.md) allow traders to control a larger portion of stock with a relatively small investment, providing [leverage](../l/leverage.md). This can amplify potential returns because even a small movement in the stock's price can lead to significant profits. However, it's important to [note](../n/note.md) that [leverage](../l/leverage.md) also magnifies potential losses.

### Flexibility of Strategies
Optionable [stocks](../s/stock.md) enable a wide [range](../r/range.md) of [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), from straightforward directional bets using call or [put options](../p/put_options.md) to more sophisticated combinations like [spreads](../s/spreads.md), straddles, and strangles. These strategies can cater to various [market](../m/market.md) expectations, whether bullish, bearish, or [neutral](../n/neutral.md).

### Hedging
[Options](../o/options.md) are powerful tools for hedging. Investors can use [options](../o/options.md) to protect their portfolios from adverse price movements. For instance, purchasing [put options](../p/put_options.md) can serve as [insurance](../i/insurance.md) against declines in the stock prices the [investor](../i/investor.md) owns.

### Income Generation
Selling [options](../o/options.md), particularly covered calls, allows investors to generate [income](../i/income.md) from their [holdings](../h/holdings.md). By selling call [options](../o/options.md) against [shares](../s/shares.md) they own, investors receive the [premium](../p/premium.md) from the option [sale](../s/sale.md), which acts as [income](../i/income.md) in addition to any dividends the stock might pay.

## Challenges and Risks

### Complexity
Trading [options](../o/options.md) is more complex compared to trading [stocks](../s/stock.md) because it involves understanding various factors like strike prices, expiration dates, implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md), and the [Greeks](../g/greeks.md) ([Delta](../d/delta.md), [Gamma](../g/gamma.md), [Theta](../t/theta.md), and [Vega](../v/vega.md)). New traders need to educate themselves thoroughly to [trade](../t/trade.md) [options](../o/options.md) effectively.

### Time Decay
[Options](../o/options.md) are time-sensitive assets, and their [value](../v/value.md) diminishes as they approach expiration, a concept known as [time decay](../t/time_decay.md). Traders must account for this when holding [options](../o/options.md) over periods, as it can erode the [premium](../p/premium.md) paid, especially for [out-of-the-money options](../o/out-of-the-money_options.md).

### Volatility
While [volatility](../v/volatility.md) can present opportunities, it also introduces [risk](../r/risk.md). High [volatility](../v/volatility.md) can lead to significant price swings, affecting the [value](../v/value.md) of [options](../o/options.md) contracts unpredictably. Traders must manage [risk](../r/risk.md) carefully and may use strategies like [spreads](../s/spreads.md) to mitigate the effects of [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

### Margin Requirements
Trading [options](../o/options.md) on [margin](../m/margin.md) can increase [leverage](../l/leverage.md) but also the [risk](../r/risk.md). Brokers require certain [margin](../m/margin.md) levels for opening and maintaining [options](../o/options.md) positions, and traders must ensure they have adequate funds to meet these requirements to avoid forced liquidations.

## Conclusion

Optionable [stocks](../s/stock.md) [open](../o/open.md) up a [wealth](../w/wealth.md) of opportunities for traders and investors, allowing for the implementation of various strategies ranging from hedging and [speculation](../s/speculation.md) to [income](../i/income.md) generation and leveraged plays. These [stocks](../s/stock.md) are typically more [liquid](../l/liquid.md), come from financially [robust](../r/robust.md) companies, and meet stringent listing criteria set by [options](../o/options.md) exchanges and regulators. The ability to [trade](../t/trade.md) [options](../o/options.md) on these [stocks](../s/stock.md) adds an extra dimension to the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), contributing to enhanced [market efficiency](../m/market_efficiency.md) and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md). However, traders must be mindful of the complexities and inherent risks involved in [options](../o/options.md) trading, necessitating sufficient education and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices. For more information and a list of optionable [stocks](../s/stock.md), traders can explore resources provided by major [options](../o/options.md) exchanges like the CBOE: [CBOE Optionable Stocks](https://www.cboe.com).

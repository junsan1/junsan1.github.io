# OneCoin

OneCoin was a cryptocurrency-based [Ponzi scheme](../p/ponzi_scheme.md) that was launched in 2014 by Ruja Ignatova, a Bulgarian woman who is now on the FBI's Most Wanted list. The scam primarily targeted investors by promising high returns with minimal [risk](../r/risk.md), using characteristics of multi-level [marketing](../m/marketing.md) (MLM) and leveraging the increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies to lure investors. Unsurprisingly, it turned out to be one of the largest crypto frauds in history, with estimates of the fraudulent gains ranging up to $5 billion. This article delves into the inner workings of the OneCoin scam, its development, key players, and the aftermath.

## The Genesis of OneCoin

### Background

Ruja Ignatova, who holds a PhD in European private law, founded OneCoin Ltd in 2014. Before this, Ignatova was involved in several other dubious ventures, one of which she was convicted for. Along with her husband and father, she had also purchased a company that eventually filed for [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) in Germany under allegations of [asset](../a/asset.md)-stripping. These ventures helped her [gain](../g/gain.md) both the confidence and the know-how to execute the OneCoin scam.

### Concept

OneCoin was pitched as a cryptocurrency similar to [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md), but allegedly more sophisticated and advantageous. It was described as the "next [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md)," and investors were led to believe that it provided an opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a promising [digital currency](../d/digital_currency.md). The company claimed that OneCoin had a high [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) because it was purportedly backed by a [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) and [mining](../m/mining.md) setup similar to [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md).

## Structure of the Scheme

The OneCoin scam was complex and multi-faceted, making it difficult for casual observers to see through its layers of deception.

### Multi-Level Marketing (MLM)

OneCoin adopted a Multi-Level [Marketing](../m/marketing.md) (MLM) strategy to expand its reach. This strategy incentivized participants to recruit new members to earn higher returns. Each new recruit had to buy a training package, and the person who recruited them earned a [commission](../c/commission.md). This created a pyramid structure where [earnings](../e/earnings.md) were dependent on recruiting new investors.

### Training Packages

OneCoin sold various “educational” packages priced from 100 euros to 118,000 euros. These packages ostensibly offered educational materials on cryptocurrency trading and included "tokens" which could be used to "mine" OneCoins. The more expensive the package, the more tokens one would receive. However, in reality, the educational materials were often basic and could easily be found for free online.

### Non-Existent Blockchain

Despite the claims of having its [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md), OneCoin did not run on a public ledger. This means there was no [transparency](../t/transparency.md) in the creation and [transaction](../t/transaction.md) of coins. Essentially, OneCoin operated from a centralized database managed by the company itself, allowing it to manipulate numbers at [will](../w/will.md).

### No External Exchange

OneCoin was not, and has never been, [listed](../l/listed.md) on any external cryptocurrency exchanges. This meant investors could not [trade](../t/trade.md) their OneCoins for other cryptocurrencies or [fiat money](../f/fiat_money.md). Instead, the company claimed that members could use the OneCoin [Exchange](../e/exchange.md), an internal platform, which later turned out to be largely illiquid.

## Key Players

### Ruja Ignatova

Ruja was the mastermind behind OneCoin, often referred to as the "Cryptoqueen". She was the public face of OneCoin, delivering speeches at opulent events and conferences worldwide to [gain](../g/gain.md) credibility and attract investors. She disappeared in 2017, just days before a U.S. [warrant](../w/warrant.md) was issued for her arrest, and remains at large.

### Konstantin Ignatov

Ruja's younger brother, Konstantin, took over operations following her disappearance. He was arrested in March 2019 on charges of [wire fraud](../w/wire_fraud.md) and [money laundering](../m/money_laundering.md), among others. Konstantin has cooperated with authorities and has provided testimony against other OneCoin associates.

### Sebastian Greenwood

Sebastian Greenwood was another key executive within the OneCoin [business](../b/business.md) structure. Partnering with Ruja Ignatova, he played a significant role in [marketing](../m/marketing.md) and expanding the reach of the OneCoin scam. Sebastian was arrested in November 2018 and faces numerous charges, including conspiracy to commit [wire fraud](../w/wire_fraud.md) and conspiracy to commit [money laundering](../m/money_laundering.md).

## The Aftermath

### Legal Actions

Various countries have taken actions against OneCoin and its promoters. For instance, India, Italy, China, and Belize have issued warnings or taken actions against the organization. U.S. authorities have been particularly active, with [multiple](../m/multiple.md) indictments and arrests.

### Victims

It is estimated that around 3 million people were defrauded by OneCoin. Many investors lost their life savings, and the scam had a significant socio-economic impact, particularly in developing countries.

### Seized Assets

Investigations and legal proceedings have led to the seizure of millions of dollars in assets associated with OneCoin. Authorities are working to [return](../r/return.md) these funds to defrauded investors, although a significant portion of the [wealth](../w/wealth.md) amassed by the scheme is still unaccounted for.

## Conclusion

OneCoin's case emphasizes the need for increased vigilance and regulatory oversight in the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrency and investment schemes. The allure of quick, high returns can cloud [judgment](../j/judgment.md), but potential investors must conduct thorough [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md) to avoid being victimized by fraudulent schemes. The saga of OneCoin continues to unfold, with national and international authorities still on the hunt for Ruja Ignatova and other key figures involved in the scam.

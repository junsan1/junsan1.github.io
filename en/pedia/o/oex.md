# OEX

The OEX, or Standard & Poor's 100 Index (S&P 100), is a stock market index created by Standard & Poor's (S&P), which measures the stock performance of 100 large companies listed on the US stock exchanges. The OEX, also known as the S&P 100, is a subset of the S&P 500, including the largest and most established US companies with exchange-listed options, making it one of the key indices in the financial markets. 

## Overview

### Index Composition

The S&P 100 index comprises 100 major blue-chip companies selected from the S&P 500. The selection is based on various criteria such as market capitalization, liquidity, and industry representation. The index provides a broad snapshot of the performance of leading US companies, covering diverse sectors such as technology, finance, healthcare, consumer services, and energy.

#### Characteristics:
- **Market Capitalization:** The constituents are among the largest firms by market capitalization, ensuring that the index captures a significant portion of the market's total value.
- **Liquidity:** Selected stocks are required to have high liquidity, which facilitates active trading and reliable price discovery.
- **diversification:** The index covers a wide array of sectors, which helps in diversifying the risk for investors looking at the performance of the US stock market.

### Calculation

The S&P 100 is calculated using the market capitalization-weighted method. Each stock in the index is weighted according to its total market value relative to the total market value of the other stocks in the index. This weighting mechanism ensures that larger companies have a more significant impact on the index's performance.

#### Formula:
The price of the S&P 100 index is calculated using the following formula:

\[ \text{Index Level} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{100} (P_i \times Q_i)}{D} \]

Where:
- \(P_i\) is the price of stock \(i\)
- \(Q_i\) is the number of outstanding shares of stock \(i\)
- \(D\) is the divisor, which is adjusted for stock splits, dividends, and other corporate actions.

### Options Trading

A notable feature of the OEX is that it is one of the most widely traded options indices, which provides investors with opportunities to hedge, leverage, and speculate. The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) offers options contracts on the S&P 100, making it an important instrument for traders and portfolio managers.

#### Types of OEX Options:
- **American-Style Options:** Allow the holder to exercise the option at any time before the expiration date.
- **European-Style Options:** Can only be exercised on the expiration date.
- **Index Options:** Provide a way to trade based on the overall movement of the 100 stocks in the index rather than individual stocks.

## Historical Performance

The S&P 100 has historically been a robust indicator of major movements in the US economy and has generally mirrored the performance of the broader S&P 500. Given its focus on large-cap stocks, the index tends to be less volatile than smaller-cap or sector-specific indices.

### Major Milestones:
- **1983:** The CBOE introduced options on the OEX, which became an instrumental tool for market participants.
- **2000s:** The index saw significant changes as technology companies grew in valuation, leading to a heavier weight in tech firms.
- **2008-2009:** The financial crisis led to large swings in index values, reflecting the economic turmoil.
- **2020-Present:** The COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented volatility, but the index has largely recovered, supported by technology and healthcare sectors.

## Role in Portfolio Management

### Benchmarking

The S&P 100 serves as an important benchmark for fund managers and investors. It is often compared against other indices like the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average to evaluate performance. Because the S&P 100 represents the leading companies, many investment funds benchmark their performance against this index.

### Hedging and Diversification

Investors use options on the S&P 100 to hedge their portfolios against market risks. By buying put options, for example, they can protect against declines in the market. Conversely, call options allow investors to benefit from upward movements in the market. Additionally, the index's broad industry coverage provides built-in diversification, which is crucial for managing risk.

### Strategies

Several trading and investing strategies revolve around the OEX, including:
- **Index Arbitrage:** This involves exploiting price differences between the index and its futures contracts.
- **Covered Call Writing:** Selling call options on stocks held within the S&P 100 to generate income.
- **Protective Puts:** Buying puts on the index to hedge against potential downturns in the market.

## Comparisons with Other Indices

### S&P 100 vs. S&P 500

While the S&P 500 includes a broader array of 500 companies, the S&P 100 focuses on the top 100, which generally are more stable and have a larger market impact. The performance of the S&P 100 often approximates that of the S&P 500 due to the significant overlap in large-cap stocks. However, the S&P 100 may exhibit less volatility due to its concentration on established firms.

### S&P 100 vs. NASDAQ-100

The NASDAQ-100 includes 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange, which gives it a heavier weighting towards technology companies. On the other hand, the S&P 100 is more diversified across different sectors. This makes the S&P 100 less technology-focused and potentially less volatile than the NASDAQ-100.

## Technological and Analytical Tools

### Algo Trading

Algorithmic trading has seen increased use in trading S&P 100 options due to the index's liquidity and the technical analysis opportunities provided. Algorithms can be designed to exploit small price discrepancies, execute trades at optimal times, and manage risk more effectively.

#### Key Tools:
- **Quantitative Models:** Used for predicting price movements based on historical data.
- **High-Frequency Trading (HFT):** Algorithms execute trades in fractions of a second to capitalize on minimal price changes.
- **Machine Learning:** Advanced machine learning models analyze complex data sets to determine trading signals.

### FinTech Impact

Financial technology (FinTech) has revolutionized trading of the S&P 100, making it more accessible and efficient. Online platforms and mobile apps enable investors to trade options on the go, using sophisticated interfaces that provide real-time data, analytics, and decision-making tools.

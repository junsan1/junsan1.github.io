# Outright Option

An outright option, commonly referred to as a "[vanilla option](../v/vanilla_option.md)," is a type of financial [derivative](../d/derivative.md) that grants the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy ([call option](../c/call_option.md)) or sell ([put option](../p/put.md)) an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at a predetermined price ([strike price](../s/strike_price.md)) on or before a specified [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md). This basic [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) is a cornerstone in the world of [options](../o/options.md) trading and plays a significant role in hedging and [speculation](../s/speculation.md) strategies.

## Types of Outright Options

There are two main types of outright [options](../o/options.md): call [options](../o/options.md) and [put options](../p/put_options.md).

### Call Option

A [call option](../c/call_option.md) gives the holder the right to buy an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md). Investors purchase call [options](../o/options.md) when they believe that the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) [will](../w/will.md) rise above the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) before the [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md). The [risk](../r/risk.md) is limited to the [premium](../p/premium.md) paid for the option, while the [profit](../p/profit.md) potential is theoretically unlimited, as the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) can rise indefinitely.

### Put Option

A [put option](../p/put.md), on the other hand, grants the holder the right to sell an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md). Investors buy [put options](../p/put_options.md) when they anticipate that the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) [will](../w/will.md) fall below the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) before expiration. Similar to call [options](../o/options.md), the [risk](../r/risk.md) is contained to the [premium](../p/premium.md) paid, while the potential [profit](../p/profit.md) is substantial, especially if the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s price falls significantly.

## Key Components of Outright Options

### Strike Price

The [strike price](../s/strike_price.md), also known as the [exercise price](../e/excersise_price.md), is the predetermined price at which the holder can buy (call) or sell (put) the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). The [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) is essential as it determines the [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) of the option.

### Expiration Date

The [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md) is the date upon which the option either needs to be exercised or becomes void. There are two styles of [options](../o/options.md) based on the expiration terms:

- **American [Options](../o/options.md):** Can be exercised at any time up to and including the [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md).
- **[European Options](../e/european_options.md):** Can only be exercised on the [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md) itself.

### Premium

The [premium](../p/premium.md) is the price paid by the buyer to the seller for the option. It is influenced by several factors, including the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md), time to expiration, [volatility](../v/volatility.md), and [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

### Intrinsic Value vs. Extrinsic Value

- **[Intrinsic Value](../i/intrinsic_value.md):** The difference between the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s current price and the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of the option. For a [call option](../c/call_option.md), [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) = current price - [strike price](../s/strike_price.md). For a [put option](../p/put.md), [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) = [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) - current price.
- **[Extrinsic Value](../e/extrinsic_value.md):** Also known as [time value](../t/time_value.md), it represents the portion of the option's [premium](../p/premium.md) that exceeds its [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md), often influenced by the time until expiration and the [volatility](../v/volatility.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

## Pricing Models

Outright [options](../o/options.md) are generally priced using sophisticated [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md). The two most prevalent models are:

### Black-Scholes Model

Developed in 1973 by Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and Robert Merton, the [Black-Scholes model](../b/black-scholes_model.md) is used to price European-style [options](../o/options.md). The formula helps calculate the theoretical [value](../v/value.md) of [options](../o/options.md), considering factors such as the current price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), the option's [strike price](../s/strike_price.md), time to expiration, [risk](../r/risk.md)-free [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md), and [volatility](../v/volatility.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

### Binomial Model

In contrast to the [Black-Scholes model](../b/black-scholes_model.md), the Binomial model uses a discrete-time framework for option pricing. It involves constructing a binomial tree to represent possible future price movements of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). This model is versatile and can be used for both American and [European options](../e/european_options.md).

## Strategies Involving Outright Options

Outright [options](../o/options.md) can be utilized in various [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on different [market](../m/market.md) conditions or to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) risks.

### Covered Call

A [covered call](../c/covered_call.md) involves holding the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) and writing (selling) a [call option](../c/call_option.md) on the same [asset](../a/asset.md). The strategy generates additional [income](../i/income.md) from the [premium](../p/premium.md) received while limiting [upside potential](../u/upside_potential_in_trading.md).

### Protective Put

A [protective put](../p/protective_put.md) strategy entails holding the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) while purchasing a [put option](../p/put.md). This serves as [insurance](../i/insurance.md) against a decline in the [asset](../a/asset.md)â€™s price, thus limiting potential losses.

### Straddle

A [straddle](../s/straddle.md) strategy involves buying both a call and a [put option](../p/put.md) with the same [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) and [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md). It profits from significant price movements in either direction but requires the price movement to be substantial enough to cover the combined premiums paid.

### Strangle

Similar to a [straddle](../s/straddle.md), a [strangle](../s/strangle.md) involves buying a call and a [put option](../p/put.md); however, the call [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) is higher than the put [strike price](../s/strike_price.md). This strategy is beneficial when expecting significant [volatility](../v/volatility.md) but not to the same degree as a [straddle](../s/straddle.md).

### Iron Condor

An [iron condor](../i/iron_condor.md) strategy involves selling one out-of-the-[money](../m/money.md) call and one out-of-the-[money](../m/money.md) put, while simultaneously buying another out-of-the-[money](../m/money.md) call with a higher [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) and another out-of-the-[money](../m/money.md) put with a lower [strike price](../s/strike_price.md). This strategy aims to [profit](../p/profit.md) from low [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and a [range](../r/range.md)-bound [market](../m/market.md) scenario.

## Risks Associated with Outright Options

While outright [options](../o/options.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) significant flexibility and potential rewards, they also come with inherent risks:

### Loss of Premium

The most apparent [risk](../r/risk.md) for option buyers is the loss of the [premium](../p/premium.md) paid if the option expires worthless. For call [options](../o/options.md), this occurs if the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price does not exceed the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md). For [put options](../p/put_options.md), it happens if the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s price doesn't fall below the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).

### Leverage

[Options](../o/options.md) provide substantial [leverage](../l/leverage.md), meaning small movements in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price can lead to significant changes in option prices, magnifying potential losses and gains. This [leverage](../l/leverage.md) can be a double-edged sword for traders.

### Volatility

[Volatility](../v/volatility.md) is a critical [factor](../f/factor.md) influencing option prices. While it can provide opportunities for substantial gains, it also adds [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) and [risk](../r/risk.md). Sudden changes in [market](../m/market.md) conditions can lead to erratic movements in option prices.

## Market Participants

Different [market](../m/market.md) participants use outright [options](../o/options.md) for various purposes, ranging from [speculation](../s/speculation.md) to [risk management](../r/risk_management.md):

### Speculators

Speculators use [options](../o/options.md) to bet on the direction of the [market](../m/market.md). They might purchase call [options](../o/options.md) if they expect prices to rise or [put options](../p/put_options.md) if they anticipate a bearish [trend](../t/trend.md). Speculators are attracted to [options](../o/options.md) for their [leverage](../l/leverage.md) and potential [return](../r/return.md) on investment.

### Hedgers

Hedgers use [options](../o/options.md) to mitigate risks associated with price movements of [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets. For instance, a farmer might use [put options](../p/put_options.md) to lock in a price for their crop, protecting against a potential drop in [market](../m/market.md) prices.

### Market Makers

[Market](../m/market.md) makers play a crucial role in [options](../o/options.md) markets by providing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md). They stand ready to buy and sell [options](../o/options.md), ensuring that traders can enter and exit positions efficiently. [Market](../m/market.md) makers often employ complex [hedging strategies](../h/hedging_strategies.md) to manage their [risk](../r/risk.md).

## Regulatory Environment

[Options](../o/options.md) trading is highly regulated to ensure [transparency](../t/transparency.md), fairness, and protection for investors. In the United States, the primary regulatory body overseeing [options](../o/options.md) markets is the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC). Additionally, exchanges like the Chicago Board [Options](../o/options.md) [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (CBOE) and the Intercontinental [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (ICE) are significant players in the [options](../o/options.md) [market](../m/market.md), providing platforms for trading and establishing standards and rules.

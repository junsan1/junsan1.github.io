# Open Range Breakout (ORB)

Open Range Breakout (ORB) is a popular trading strategy used in the world of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). It revolves around identifying and capitalizing on price movements that occur when the trading range defined by the market's opening period is broken. This strategy can be applied to various financial instruments including stocks, futures, forex, and cryptocurrencies. This document aims to provide an in-depth look at the ORB strategy, including its underlying principles, implementation methodologies, and considerations for [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) and optimization.

## Background and Principles

### Definition

The "open range" refers to the high and low price levels during the first specified period after the market opens. This period can vary depending on the trader's preference and the nature of the instrument being traded. Commonly, the first 5, 15, 30, or 60 minutes after the market opens are used to define the open range.

The "breakout" happens when the price moves outside this defined range, indicating a potential trend direction for the rest of the trading session.

### Key Concepts

- **Open Range High**: The highest price achieved during the opening time period.
- **Open Range Low**: The lowest price achieved during the opening time period.
- **Breakout**: A price movement outside the open range defined by the high and low prices.
- **Valid Breakout**: A breakout confirmed by additional price movement and trading volume in the direction of the breakout.

## Execution Methodologies

### Preparation Steps

1. **Data Collection**: Gather historical price data and identify the open range for the desired period.
2. **Parameter Setting**: Define the specifics of the open range (e.g., 5-minute, 15-minute) and the entry and exit rules.
3. **Algorithm Development**: Create a trading algorithm to automate the strategy.

### Algorithmic Implementation

#### Identifying the Open Range

The first step is to calculate the open range high and low. This involves:

1. Monitoring the price movements during the first n minutes after the market opens.
2. Recording the highest and lowest prices reached within this period.

For example, if a trader chooses a 15-minute open range on a stock, they will track the prices from the market open until 15 minutes have passed and note the highest and lowest prices during that interval.

#### Determining Breakouts

Once the open range is established, the trading strategy looks for price movements that break out of this range. 

- A **bullish breakout** occurs when the price rises above the open range high.
- A **bearish breakout** happens when the price falls below the open range low.

#### Executing Trades

**Entry Rule**:
- For a bullish breakout, place a buy order when the price moves above the open range high.
- For a bearish breakout, place a sell order when the price drops below the open range low.

**Exit Rule**:
- Utilize stop-loss and take-profit levels to manage the risk and secure profits.
- Some strategies may include trailing stops to lock in gains as the trend progresses.

### Optimization Techniques

#### Filtering Breakouts

Not all breakouts lead to substantial price movements. Traders often look for additional factors to validate the breakout such as:

- **Volume**: Higher trading volumes during the breakout period can indicate stronger conviction behind the move.
- **Volatility**: Markets with higher volatility might provide more significant breakouts, but they also carry higher risks.

#### Time Filters

Setting time filters can also improve the strategy's robustness. For instance:
- Avoiding trades on days with significant economic announcements.
- Limiting the strategy's application to specific market hours when liquidity and volatility are higher.

## Risk Management

[Risk management](../r/risk_management.md) is a critical component of any trading strategy. For ORB, consider the following:

1. **[Stop-Loss Orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md)**: Place [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md) to limit potential losses. These can be set just inside the open range boundary to prevent small whipsaws from triggering the stop.
2. **[Position Sizing](../p/position_sizing.md)**: Determine the appropriate position size based on the risk per trade, which is usually a fixed percentage of the trading capital.
3. **Diversification**: Apply the ORB strategy across different instruments and time frames to diversify risk.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

- **Simplicity**: The strategy is straightforward, making it accessible for both novice and experienced traders.
- **Automation**: Easy to implement in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) systems.
- **Early Start**: Traders can capitalize on early trends within the trading session.

### Disadvantages

- **False Breakouts**: The strategy is susceptible to false breakouts, which can lead to premature entries and exits.
- **Market Conditions**: Varying market conditions might affect the strategy's performance, requiring constant optimization.
- **Higher Costs**: Frequent trading can incur higher transaction costs.

# Open Range Breakout (ORB)

[Open](../o/open.md) [Range](../r/range.md) [Breakout](../b/breakout.md) (ORB) is a popular [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) used in the world of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). It revolves around identifying and capitalizing on price movements that occur when the trading [range](../r/range.md) defined by the [market](../m/market.md)'s opening period is broken. This strategy can be applied to various financial instruments including [stocks](../s/stock.md), [futures](../f/futures.md), forex, and cryptocurrencies. This document aims to provide an in-depth look at the ORB strategy, including its [underlying](../u/underlying.md) principles, implementation methodologies, and considerations for [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) and [optimization](../o/optimization.md).

## Background and Principles

### Definition

The "[open](../o/open.md) [range](../r/range.md)" refers to the high and low price levels during the first specified period after the [market](../m/market.md) opens. This period can vary depending on the [trader](../t/trader.md)'s preference and the nature of the instrument being traded. Commonly, the first 5, 15, 30, or 60 minutes after the [market](../m/market.md) opens are used to define the [open](../o/open.md) [range](../r/range.md).

The "[breakout](../b/breakout.md)" happens when the price moves outside this defined [range](../r/range.md), indicating a potential [trend](../t/trend.md) direction for the rest of the [trading session](../t/trading_session.md).

### Key Concepts

- **[Open](../o/open.md) [Range](../r/range.md) High**: The highest price achieved during the opening time period.
- **[Open](../o/open.md) [Range](../r/range.md) Low**: The lowest price achieved during the opening time period.
- **[Breakout](../b/breakout.md)**: A price movement outside the [open](../o/open.md) [range](../r/range.md) defined by the high and low prices.
- **Valid [Breakout](../b/breakout.md)**: A [breakout](../b/breakout.md) confirmed by additional price movement and trading [volume](../v/volume.md) in the direction of the [breakout](../b/breakout.md).

## Execution Methodologies

### Preparation Steps

1. **Data Collection**: Gather historical price data and identify the [open](../o/open.md) [range](../r/range.md) for the desired period.
2. **Parameter Setting**: Define the specifics of the [open](../o/open.md) [range](../r/range.md) (e.g., 5-minute, 15-minute) and the entry and exit rules.
3. **Algorithm Development**: Create a trading algorithm to automate the strategy.

### Algorithmic Implementation

#### Identifying the Open Range

The first step is to calculate the [open](../o/open.md) [range](../r/range.md) high and low. This involves:

1. Monitoring the price movements during the first n minutes after the [market](../m/market.md) opens.
2. Recording the highest and lowest prices reached within this period.

For example, if a [trader](../t/trader.md) chooses a 15-minute [open](../o/open.md) [range](../r/range.md) on a stock, they [will](../w/will.md) track the prices from the [market](../m/market.md) [open](../o/open.md) until 15 minutes have passed and [note](../n/note.md) the highest and lowest prices during that interval.

#### Determining Breakouts

Once the [open](../o/open.md) [range](../r/range.md) is established, the [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) looks for price movements that break out of this [range](../r/range.md). 

- A **bullish [breakout](../b/breakout.md)** occurs when the price rises above the [open](../o/open.md) [range](../r/range.md) high.
- A **bearish [breakout](../b/breakout.md)** happens when the price falls below the [open](../o/open.md) [range](../r/range.md) low.

#### Executing Trades

**Entry Rule**:
- For a bullish [breakout](../b/breakout.md), place a buy [order](../o/order.md) when the price moves above the [open](../o/open.md) [range](../r/range.md) high.
- For a bearish [breakout](../b/breakout.md), place a sell [order](../o/order.md) when the price drops below the [open](../o/open.md) [range](../r/range.md) low.

**Exit Rule**:
- Utilize stop-loss and take-[profit](../p/profit.md) levels to manage the [risk](../r/risk.md) and secure profits.
- Some strategies may include trailing stops to lock in gains as the [trend](../t/trend.md) progresses.

### Optimization Techniques

#### Filtering Breakouts

Not all breakouts lead to substantial price movements. Traders often look for additional factors to validate the [breakout](../b/breakout.md) such as:

- **[Volume](../v/volume.md)**: Higher trading volumes during the [breakout](../b/breakout.md) period can indicate stronger conviction behind the move.
- **[Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: Markets with higher [volatility](../v/volatility.md) might provide more significant breakouts, but they also carry higher risks.

#### Time Filters

Setting time filters can also improve the strategy's robustness. For instance:
- Avoiding trades on days with significant economic announcements.
- Limiting the strategy's application to specific [market](../m/market.md) hours when [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and [volatility](../v/volatility.md) are higher.

## Risk Management

[Risk management](../r/risk_management.md) is a critical component of any [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md). For ORB, consider the following:

1. **[Stop-Loss Orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md)**: Place [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md) to limit potential losses. These can be set just inside the [open](../o/open.md) [range](../r/range.md) boundary to prevent small whipsaws from triggering the stop.
2. **[Position Sizing](../p/position_sizing.md)**: Determine the appropriate position size based on the [risk](../r/risk.md) per [trade](../t/trade.md), which is usually a fixed percentage of the trading [capital](../c/capital.md).
3. **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: Apply the ORB strategy across different instruments and time frames to diversify [risk](../r/risk.md).

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

- **Simplicity**: The strategy is straightforward, making it accessible for both novice and experienced traders.
- **Automation**: Easy to implement in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) systems.
- **Early Start**: Traders can [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on early trends within the [trading session](../t/trading_session.md).

### Disadvantages

- **False Breakouts**: The strategy is susceptible to false breakouts, which can lead to premature entries and exits.
- **[Market](../m/market.md) Conditions**: Varying [market](../m/market.md) conditions might affect the strategy's performance, requiring constant [optimization](../o/optimization.md).
- **Higher Costs**: Frequent trading can incur higher [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md).

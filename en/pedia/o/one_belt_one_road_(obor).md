# One Belt One Road (OBOR)

The One Belt One Road (OBOR), also known as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), is a global development strategy adopted by China in 2013. The initiative aims to enhance regional connectivity and embrace [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) through building [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) and broadening [trade](../t/trade.md) links between Asia, Africa, and Europe. With the official launch of the initiative attributed to Chinese President Xi Jinping, OBOR marks China's most ambitious political-economic undertaking to date.

## Background

The OBOR initiative is rooted in historical precedents. The “Belt” refers to the Silk Road Economic Belt, which accounts for land routes reminiscent of the historic Silk Road that connected China with Europe through Central Asia. The "Road," or the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, involves sea routes linking China’s coast to Europe through the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean.

### Silk Road Economic Belt
The Silk Road Economic Belt is designed to link China with Europe through Central Asia. It large-scale road, rail, and energy projects, aims to foster [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) within these regions, increase [commerce](../c/commerce.md), and promote investment. The route broadly covers the modern equivalent of the historical Silk Road and facilitates land-based connections.

### 21st Century Maritime Silk Road
The Maritime Silk Road focuses on connecting China to Southeast Asia, South Asia, Africa, and Europe via sea. This route emphasizes the development of ports and maritime [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md), fostering connectivity and [trade](../t/trade.md) by sea. It enables faster shipping and trading routes, contributing to the global [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md).

## Objectives

### Economic Goals
In economic terms, the primary goal of OBOR is to create [trade](../t/trade.md) corridors akin to the historic Silk Road's commercial routes. It seeks to [open](../o/open.md) up new markets for Chinese products and services, promote [export](../e/export.md) industries, manage excess [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) capacities, and ensure long-term energy [security](../s/security.md) by diversifying [supply](../s/supply.md) routes.

### Political/Military Goals
From a political and military perspective, OBOR is also aimed at strengthening China's geopolitical influence. The creation of physical [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) across participating countries offers China better access to a region experiencing [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md). Moreover, it projects soft power through developmental aid and mutually beneficial economic agreements.

### Developmental Goals
OBOR emphasizes reducing the developmental gap between China's wealthier coastal regions and its underdeveloped western provinces. Initiating [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) projects improves connectivity, creates jobs, and promotes economic activity in Xinjiang, Tibet, and other inland regions of China.

## Financial Framework

### Funding
A variety of financial mechanisms have been established to [fund](../f/fund.md) OBOR projects. 
- **Silk Road [Fund](../f/fund.md)**: This $40 billion [fund](../f/fund.md) was created specifically to [finance](../f/finance.md) OBOR projects.
- **Asian [Infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) Investment [Bank](../b/bank.md) (AIIB)**: Founded by Beijing, AIIB supports [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) development across Asia.
- **New Development [Bank](../b/bank.md)**: Also known as the BRICS Development [Bank](../b/bank.md), it complements OBOR [financing](../f/financing.md) schemes.

### Investment
Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are central players in OBOR. They have been tapped to build [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) projects, from railways to ports, often under favorable lending conditions. These heavy investments foster long-term [trade](../t/trade.md) relations and economic dependency on Chinese [capital](../c/capital.md) and [trade](../t/trade.md).

## Key Projects

### China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)
One of the most significant and high-profile OBOR projects, CPEC is a network of highways, railways, and energy projects aimed at enhancing connectivity between China and Pakistan. It includes developments such as Gwadar Port, a strategic deep-sea port that provides China with direct access to the Arabian Sea.

### Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Rail 
Another significant OBOR project, this rail line connects Jakarta and Bandung in Indonesia, and is intended to enhance economic activity and reduce travel time significantly. It exemplifies China's advancements in high-speed rail technology and its willingness to [export](../e/export.md) such expertise.

### Mombasa-Nairobi Railway 
A key project in Africa, this 480 km railway in Kenya enhances internal [trade](../t/trade.md) and connectivity. It significantly reduces travel time between the two key cities and facilitates the movement of goods, demonstrating OBOR's impact on African [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md).

## Challenges and Criticisms

### Debt Sustainability
One of the significant criticisms of OBOR is the potential for [debt](../d/debt.md) traps. Many countries participating in OBOR initiatives obtain large loans from China, which some analysts argue could result in unsustainable [debt](../d/debt.md) levels. In cases where countries [fail](../f/fail.md) to repay loans, China may [gain](../g/gain.md) control over strategically important assets, raising concerns regarding sovereignty.

### Geopolitical Tensions
OBOR has generated geopolitical tensions, particularly with India's objections to certain projects that pass through disputed territories. Similarly, some Western countries argue that OBOR lacks [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and adheres to unilateral Chinese interests.

### Environmental Concerns
Large-scale [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) projects often raise significant environmental concerns. The development and construction can lead to ecological disruption, displacement of local communities, and exacerbation of global climate issues.

### Implementation Hurdles
With such an ambitious [scope](../s/scope.md), OBOR faces numerous implementation challenges. There are concerns related to the quality of constructions, delays, and costs overruns. Additionally, sociopolitical instability in certain regions poses risks to the effective completion and operation of OBOR projects.

## Future Prospects

### Expansion
OBOR is set to expand well beyond its initial [scope](../s/scope.md). New ‘Digital Silk Road’ initiatives involve investments in telecommunications and digital [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md), further broadening OBOR’s reach. [Expansion](../e/expansion.md) into Latin America and the Caribbean indicates OBOR's global ambitions.

### Technological Integration
With advancements in technology, OBOR is likely to encompass extended cooperation in areas like AI, cybersecurity, and e-[commerce](../c/commerce.md). Engaging in [joint](../j/joint.md) technological projects with OBOR countries could enhance China’s soft power and global technological dominance.

### Global Partnerships
China continues to seek partnerships with more countries and corporations, thus promoting OBOR's broader acceptance. By enhancing its financial, political, and cultural relationships, China aims to build a multi-faceted network where mutual gains are realized.

In conclusion, the One Belt One Road initiative is transforming global economic landscapes. By fostering new [trade](../t/trade.md) routes and connections, OBOR promotes not only [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) development but also cultural [exchange](../e/exchange.md) and geopolitical taprooting. However, it is also accompanied by significant challenges and criticisms that must be navigated carefully to ensure its long-term success and sustainability.

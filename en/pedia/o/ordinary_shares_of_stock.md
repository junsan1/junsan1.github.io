# Ordinary Shares of Stock

Ordinary shares, also referred to as common stock, represent equity ownership in a company. Shareholders of ordinary shares are typically entitled to vote on corporate matters, such as the election of the board of directors and significant corporate events like mergers. Ordinary shares are the most common type of share issued by companies and are typically traded on stock exchanges.

## Characteristics of Ordinary Shares

### Ownership Rights

Ordinary shareholders have ownership stakes proportional to the number of shares they hold. This means they have residual claims on the company's profits and assets. In the event of liquidation, ordinary shareholders are paid after all other creditors, including preferred shareholders and bondholders.

### Voting Rights

One of the key features of ordinary shares is the voting rights they provide. Shareholders have the right to vote on major company decisions, including the election of directors, mergers, and other significant corporate policies. Typically, shareholders have one vote per share they own.

### Dividend Payments

Ordinary shareholders may receive dividends, which are periodic payments made out of a company's profits. Although dividends are not guaranteed and their amount can vary, they represent a share of the company's earnings distributed to shareholders. Companies may choose to reinvest profits back into the business rather than paying dividends, depending on their growth strategy.

### Capital Gains

Ordinary shareholders can benefit from capital gains, which arise when the value of the stock increases over time from the purchase price. Capital gains can be realized when the shareholder sells the stock at a higher price than the buying cost.

### Limited Liability

Shareholders in ordinary shares benefit from limited liability. This means their potential losses are limited to the amount they invested in the shares, protecting them from having to cover any liabilities the company may incur.

## Advantages of Ordinary Shares

### Potential for High Returns

Investing in ordinary shares can provide significant returns through capital gains and dividends. This potential for high returns can make ordinary shares an attractive investment option for many investors.

### Voting Power

Ordinary shareholders have voting power, allowing them a say in important company decisions. This can give them some control over the company's direction and governance.

### Dividend Income

While not guaranteed, ordinary shares can provide dividend income, offering investors a periodic return on their investment. This can be especially appealing for income-focused investors.

## Disadvantages of Ordinary Shares

### Volatility

The stock market can be highly volatile, and the value of ordinary shares can fluctuate significantly. This can lead to potential capital losses if the share price decreases.

### Subordinate Claim on Assets

In the event of a company's liquidation, ordinary shareholders have a subordinate claim on assets. This means they are paid after all other creditors, which can result in shareholders receiving nothing if the company's assets are insufficient.

### Dividend Uncertainty

Dividends on ordinary shares are not guaranteed and can vary based on the company's profitability and decisions. Companies may also choose to retain earnings for reinvestment purposes, leaving shareholders without dividend payments.

## Trading Ordinary Shares

### Stock Exchanges

Ordinary shares are typically traded on stock exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or Nasdaq. These exchanges provide a marketplace for investors to buy and sell shares. Companies must meet certain listing requirements and adhere to regulations to have their shares publicly traded on these exchanges.

### Online Brokerage Platforms

Investors can buy and sell ordinary shares through online brokerage platforms. These platforms offer access to various markets and trading tools, enabling investors to manage their portfolios. Some popular online brokers include:

- [TD Ameritrade](https://www.tdameritrade.com/)
- [Robinhood](https://robinhood.com/)

### Market Orders and Limit Orders

When trading ordinary shares, investors can use different types of orders to execute their trades. Two common order types are:

- Market Orders: These are executed immediately at the current market price. Market orders prioritize the speed of execution over the price.
- Limit Orders: These are executed only at a specified price or better. Limit orders prioritize the price over the speed of execution.

## Valuation of Ordinary Shares

Valuing ordinary shares involves assessing the intrinsic value of the stock to determine if it is under or overvalued in the market. Several methods can be used to value ordinary shares:

### Dividend Discount Model (DDM)

The Dividend Discount Model calculates the present value of a stock based on its expected future dividends. The basic formula for the DDM is:

\[ \text{P}_0 = \frac{\text{D}_1}{\text{r} - \text{g}} \]

Where:
- \( \text{P}_0 \) = Current stock price
- \( \text{D}_1 \) = Expected dividend in the next period
- \( \text{r} \) = Required rate of return
- \( \text{g} \) = Growth rate of dividends

### Price-Earnings (P/E) Ratio

The P/E ratio compares a company's stock price to its earnings per share (EPS). A higher P/E ratio may indicate that the stock is overvalued, while a lower P/E ratio may suggest the stock is undervalued. The formula for the P/E ratio is:

\[ \text{P/E} = \frac{\text{Stock Price}}{\text{Earnings per Share}} \]

### Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

DCF analysis estimates the intrinsic value of a stock by discounting its expected future cash flows to their present value. The DCF formula is:

\[ \text{Intrinsic Value} = \sum \left( \frac{\text{CF}_t}{(1 + \text{r})^t} \right) \]

Where:
- \( \text{CF}_t \) = Cash flow in period \( t \)
- \( \text{r} \) = Discount rate
- \( t \) = Time period

### Relative Valuation

Relative valuation involves comparing a company's financial metrics to those of similar companies in the industry. Common relative valuation metrics include the P/E ratio, Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio, and Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio.

## Risks Associated with Ordinary Shares

### Market Risk

Market risk refers to the potential for losses due to changes in the overall stock market. Factors such as economic conditions, interest rates, and geopolitical events can impact market performance.

### Company-Specific Risk

Company-specific risk involves factors that affect an individual company, such as management decisions, competitive positioning, and financial performance. These risks can lead to significant drops in the company's stock price.

### Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk arises when there is a lack of buyers or sellers in the market, making it difficult to execute trades at desired prices. Illiquid stocks can be challenging to buy or sell without significantly impacting the stock price.

### Regulatory Risk

Regulatory risk involves changes in laws or regulations that can impact a company's operations and profitability. Companies in heavily regulated industries, such as healthcare or finance, may face higher regulatory risks.

## Conclusion

Ordinary shares represent ownership in a company and provide shareholders with voting rights, potential dividend payments, and the opportunity for capital gains. While ordinary shares offer the potential for high returns, they also come with risks, including market volatility and company-specific challenges. By understanding the characteristics, advantages, and risks associated with ordinary shares, investors can make informed decisions when building their investment portfolios.

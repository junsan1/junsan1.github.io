# Ordinary Shares of Stock

Ordinary [shares](../s/shares.md), also referred to as [common stock](../c/common_stock.md), represent [equity](../e/equity.md) ownership in a company. Shareholders of ordinary [shares](../s/shares.md) are typically entitled to vote on corporate matters, such as the election of the board of directors and significant corporate events like mergers. Ordinary [shares](../s/shares.md) are the most common type of share issued by companies and are typically traded on stock exchanges.

## Characteristics of Ordinary Shares

### Ownership Rights

Ordinary shareholders have ownership stakes proportional to the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) they [hold](../h/hold.md). This means they have residual claims on the company's profits and assets. In the event of [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md), ordinary shareholders are paid after all other creditors, including preferred shareholders and bondholders.

### Voting Rights

One of the key features of ordinary [shares](../s/shares.md) is the voting rights they provide. Shareholders have the right to vote on major company decisions, including the election of directors, mergers, and other significant corporate policies. Typically, shareholders have one vote per share they own.

### Dividend Payments

Ordinary shareholders may receive dividends, which are periodic payments made out of a company's profits. Although dividends are not guaranteed and their amount can vary, they represent a share of the company's [earnings](../e/earnings.md) distributed to shareholders. Companies may choose to reinvest profits back into the [business](../b/business.md) rather than paying dividends, depending on their growth strategy.

### Capital Gains

Ordinary shareholders can benefit from [capital](../c/capital.md) gains, which arise when the [value](../v/value.md) of the stock increases over time from the purchase price. [Capital](../c/capital.md) gains can be realized when the [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) sells the stock at a higher price than the buying cost.

### Limited Liability

Shareholders in ordinary [shares](../s/shares.md) benefit from [limited liability](../l/limited_liability.md). This means their potential losses are limited to the amount they invested in the [shares](../s/shares.md), protecting them from having to cover any liabilities the company may incur.

## Advantages of Ordinary Shares

### Potential for High Returns

[Investing](../i/investing.md) in ordinary [shares](../s/shares.md) can provide significant returns through [capital](../c/capital.md) gains and dividends. This potential for high returns can make ordinary [shares](../s/shares.md) an attractive investment option for many investors.

### Voting Power

Ordinary shareholders have voting power, allowing them a say in important company decisions. This can give them some control over the company's direction and governance.

### Dividend Income

While not guaranteed, ordinary [shares](../s/shares.md) can provide [dividend](../d/dividend.md) [income](../i/income.md), [offering](../o/offering.md) investors a periodic [return](../r/return.md) on their investment. This can be especially appealing for [income](../i/income.md)-focused investors.

## Disadvantages of Ordinary Shares

### Volatility

The [stock market](../s/stock_market.md) can be highly volatile, and the [value](../v/value.md) of ordinary [shares](../s/shares.md) can fluctuate significantly. This can lead to potential [capital](../c/capital.md) losses if the share price decreases.

### Subordinate Claim on Assets

In the event of a company's [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md), ordinary shareholders have a subordinate claim on assets. This means they are paid after all other creditors, which can result in shareholders receiving nothing if the company's assets are insufficient.

### Dividend Uncertainty

Dividends on ordinary [shares](../s/shares.md) are not guaranteed and can vary based on the company's profitability and decisions. Companies may also choose to retain [earnings](../e/earnings.md) for [reinvestment](../r/reinvestment.md) purposes, leaving shareholders without [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payments.

## Trading Ordinary Shares

### Stock Exchanges

Ordinary [shares](../s/shares.md) are typically traded on stock exchanges, such as the New York Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (NYSE) or [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md). These exchanges provide a marketplace for investors to buy and sell [shares](../s/shares.md). Companies must meet certain [listing requirements](../l/listing_requirements.md) and adhere to regulations to have their [shares](../s/shares.md) publicly traded on these exchanges.

### Online Brokerage Platforms

Investors can buy and sell ordinary [shares](../s/shares.md) through online brokerage platforms. These platforms [offer](../o/offer.md) access to various markets and trading tools, enabling investors to manage their portfolios. Some popular online brokers include:

- [E*TRADE](https://us.etrade.com/home)
- [TD Ameritrade](https://www.tdameritrade.com/)
- [Robinhood](https://robinhood.com/)

### Market Orders and Limit Orders

When trading ordinary [shares](../s/shares.md), investors can use different types of orders to execute their trades. Two common [order types](../o/order_types_in_trading.md) are:

- [Market](../m/market.md) Orders: These are executed immediately at the current [market price](../m/market_price.md). [Market](../m/market.md) orders prioritize the speed of [execution](../e/execution.md) over the price.
- Limit Orders: These are executed only at a specified price or better. Limit orders prioritize the price over the speed of [execution](../e/execution.md).

## Valuation of Ordinary Shares

Valuing ordinary [shares](../s/shares.md) involves assessing the [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) of the stock to determine if it is under or [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md) in the [market](../m/market.md). Several methods can be used to [value](../v/value.md) ordinary [shares](../s/shares.md):

### Dividend Discount Model (DDM)

The [Dividend](../d/dividend.md) [Discount](../d/discount.md) Model calculates the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of a stock based on its expected future dividends. The basic formula for the DDM is:

\[ \text{P}_0 = \frac{\text{D}_1}{\text{r} - \text{g}} \]

Where:
- \( \text{P}_0 \) = Current stock price
- \( \text{D}_1 \) = Expected [dividend](../d/dividend.md) in the next period
- \( \text{r} \) = Required [rate of return](../r/rate_of_return.md)
- \( \text{g} \) = Growth rate of dividends

### Price-Earnings (P/E) Ratio

The P/E ratio compares a company's stock price to its [earnings](../e/earnings.md) per share (EPS). A higher P/E ratio may indicate that the stock is [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md), while a lower P/E ratio may suggest the stock is [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md). The formula for the P/E ratio is:

\[ \text{P/E} = \frac{\text{Stock Price}}{\text{[Earnings](../e/earnings.md) per Share}} \]

### Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

DCF analysis estimates the [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) of a stock by [discounting](../d/discounting.md) its expected future cash flows to their [present value](../p/present_value.md). The DCF formula is:

\[ \text{[Intrinsic Value](../i/intrinsic_value.md)} = \sum \left( \frac{\text{CF}_t}{(1 + \text{r})^t} \right) \]

Where:
- \( \text{CF}_t \) = [Cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) in period \( t \)
- \( \text{r} \) = [Discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md)
- \( t \) = Time period

### Relative Valuation

Relative [valuation](../v/valuation.md) involves comparing a company's financial metrics to those of similar companies in the [industry](../i/industry.md). Common relative [valuation](../v/valuation.md) metrics include the P/E ratio, Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio, and Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio.

## Risks Associated with Ordinary Shares

### Market Risk

[Market risk](../m/market_risk.md) refers to the potential for losses due to changes in the overall [stock market](../s/stock_market.md). Factors such as [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md), [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, and geopolitical events can impact [market](../m/market.md) performance.

### Company-Specific Risk

Company-specific [risk](../r/risk.md) involves factors that affect an individual company, such as management decisions, competitive positioning, and [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md). These risks can lead to significant drops in the company's stock price.

### Liquidity Risk

[Liquidity risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md) arises when there is a lack of buyers or sellers in the [market](../m/market.md), making it difficult to execute trades at desired prices. Illiquid [stocks](../s/stock.md) can be challenging to buy or sell without significantly impacting the stock price.

### Regulatory Risk

[Regulatory risk](../r/regulatory_risk.md) involves changes in laws or regulations that can impact a company's operations and profitability. Companies in heavily regulated industries, such as healthcare or [finance](../f/finance.md), may face higher regulatory risks.

## Conclusion

Ordinary [shares](../s/shares.md) represent ownership in a company and provide shareholders with voting rights, potential [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payments, and the opportunity for [capital](../c/capital.md) gains. While ordinary [shares](../s/shares.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) the potential for high returns, they also come with risks, including [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and company-specific challenges. By understanding the characteristics, advantages, and risks associated with ordinary [shares](../s/shares.md), investors can make informed decisions when building their investment portfolios.

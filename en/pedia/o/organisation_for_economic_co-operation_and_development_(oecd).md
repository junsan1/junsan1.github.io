# Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)

## Introduction
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is an international organization that works to build better policies for better lives. With a mission to promote policies that improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world, the OECD provides a platform for its member countries to collaborate and share experiences and solutions in [order](../o/order.md) to tackle common problems.

## History and Formation
The OECD was established on December 14, 1960, and it officially came into being on September 30, 1961, when the Convention on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development was signed. It succeeded the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC), which was created in 1948 to administer American and Canadian aid under the Marshall Plan for the reconstruction of Europe after World War II.

## Member Countries
As of now, the OECD comprises 38 member countries from around the world, including many of the world’s most advanced economies as well as emerging countries. Membership in the OECD means a commitment to democratic governance and the [market economy](../m/market_economy.md). Member countries include:

- United States
- United Kingdom
- Germany
- France
- Japan
- Canada
- Australia
- South Korea
- Mexico
- Turkey
- Chile
- Israel

## Structure and Governance
The OECD is structured with several key bodies and personnel that facilitate its operations. These include:

- **Council**: The main decision-making body, composed of one representative per member country and the European [Commission](../c/commission.md).
- **Secretary-General**: The chief executive of the OECD, responsible for the functioning of the organization and its secretariat.
- **Directorates**: Various directorates specialize in different policy areas such as [economics](../e/economics.md), environment, education, labor, and others.

## Objectives and Work
The OECD aims to foster [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md), financial stability, [trade](../t/trade.md), and employment while also focusing on improving the [quality of life](../q/quality_of_life.md). The organisation's objectives are achieved through:

### 1. Data Collection and Analysis
The OECD collects vast amounts of data on a wide [range](../r/range.md) of economic and social issues. It produces high-quality economic and policy analysis to inform policymaking. Examples of their major publications include the "Economic Outlook," "Employment Outlook," and "Pensions at a Glance."

### 2. Policy Recommendations
Based on their research and data, the OECD provides policy recommendations that are aimed at fostering sustainable [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) and improving the [quality of life](../q/quality_of_life.md). They focus on areas like [taxation](../t/taxation.md), labor markets, education, health, and [trade](../t/trade.md) policy.

### 3. Peer Reviews and Monitoring
Member countries undergo peer reviews where their policies are examined by experts from other OECD countries. This process promotes [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and accountability.

### 4. Setting Standards
The OECD sets international standards in various domains such as [taxation](../t/taxation.md), [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md), and financial regulations. One significant example is the OECD's work on tax cooperation through the Base Erosion and [Profit](../p/profit.md) Shifting (BEPS) initiative. 

### 5. Capacity Building
The OECD helps its member and partner countries by providing technical support and training to help them implement [best practices](../b/best_practices.md).

## Areas of Focus
The OECD covers a wide array of policy areas, each with its own set of objectives, research, and guidelines:

### 1. Economic Analysis and Policy
The OECD plays a crucial role in understanding global economic trends and providing policy advice to foster economic stability.

### 2. Education
The OECD runs the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), which evaluates educational systems worldwide by testing the skills and knowledge of 15-year-old students.

### 3. Environment
The OECD’s environmental policies aim to promote sustainable growth and address climate change through various initiatives and guidelines.

### 4. Taxation
Through the BEPS project, the OECD works to create a cohesive international tax framework to combat [tax avoidance](../t/tax_avoidance.md).

### 5. Trade
The OECD promotes [open](../o/open.md) and fair [trade](../t/trade.md) by analyzing [trade](../t/trade.md) policies and providing recommendations and standards.

### 6. Innovation and Technology
The OECD examines the impacts of technological advances and formulates policies to harness innovation for economic and social benefits.

## Special Programs
The OECD also runs several specialized programs and initiatives, including:

- **OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises**: These are recommendations addressed by governments to multinational enterprises operating in or from adhering countries. They provide non-binding principles and standards for responsible [business](../b/business.md) conduct.
  
- **Anti-Bribery Convention**: Aims to prevent bribery in international [business](../b/business.md) transactions by criminalizing the act.

## Global Relations
The OECD collaborates with numerous non-member countries and other international organizations to extend its impact globally. Non-member countries like China, Brazil, and India are some examples of active partners.

## Future Directions
The OECD is continuously evolving to address new global challenges. Areas such as digital transformation, aging populations, and [income inequality](../i/income_inequality.md) are gaining increasing focus to formulate policies for a balanced, inclusive, and sustainable future.

## Conclusion
The OECD acts as a cornerstone for international economic collaboration, providing a forum for its member countries to work together and improve the global [economy](../e/economy.md)'s health. Through its wide-ranging research, policy recommendations, and standards, the OECD has a lasting impact on global economic and social policies.

## Options Strategies

### Basic Strategies

- **Long Call**: Buying a call option with the expectation that the underlying asset will increase in price.
- **Long Put**: Buying a put option expecting the underlying asset will decrease in price.
- **Covered Call**: Selling a call option while holding the equivalent amount of the underlying asset.
- **Protective Put**: Buying a put option on an owned asset to hedge against potential declines in asset value.

### Intermediate Strategies

- **Spreads**: Combining multiple options (calls or puts) to limit risk and potential gain. Examples include bull call spreads, bear put spreads, calendar spreads, and diagonal spreads.
- **Straddles and Strangles**: Involving the purchase or sale of both a call and a put with the same or different strike prices and expiration dates, to benefit from significant price movement in either direction.

### Advanced Strategies

- **Iron Condor**: A market-neutral strategy that involves selling out-of-the-money put and call spreads to earn a net credit premium.
- **Butterfly Spread**: Involves buying and selling multiple calls or puts with different strike prices but the same expiration to achieve a net debit or credit position for limited risk and limited profit potential.
- **Ratio Spreads**: Involves holding more short positions than long positions in a particular options series, generally creating a more intricate strategy for specific market scenarios.

Effective risk management is crucial for options trading, and OIC places significant emphasis on teaching these principles. Key topics in risk management include:

- **Position Sizing**: Determining the appropriate amount to invest in each trade to control exposure.

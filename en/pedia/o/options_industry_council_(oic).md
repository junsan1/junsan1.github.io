## Options Strategies

### Basic Strategies

- **Long Call**: Buying a [call option](../c/call_option.md) with the expectation that the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) [will](../w/will.md) increase in price.
- **[Long Put](../l/long_put.md)**: Buying a [put option](../p/put.md) expecting the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) [will](../w/will.md) decrease in price.
- **[Covered Call](../c/covered_call.md)**: Selling a [call option](../c/call_option.md) while holding the equivalent amount of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).
- **[Protective Put](../p/protective_put.md)**: Buying a [put option](../p/put.md) on an owned [asset](../a/asset.md) to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against potential declines in [asset](../a/asset.md) [value](../v/value.md).

### Intermediate Strategies

- **[Spreads](../s/spreads.md)**: Combining [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [options](../o/options.md) (calls or puts) to limit [risk](../r/risk.md) and potential [gain](../g/gain.md). Examples include [bull](../b/bull.md) call [spreads](../s/spreads.md), bear put [spreads](../s/spreads.md), calendar [spreads](../s/spreads.md), and diagonal [spreads](../s/spreads.md).
- **Straddles and Strangles**: Involving the purchase or [sale](../s/sale.md) of both a call and a put with the same or different strike prices and expiration dates, to benefit from significant price movement in either direction.

### Advanced Strategies

- **[Iron Condor](../i/iron_condor.md)**: A [market](../m/market.md)-[neutral](../n/neutral.md) strategy that involves selling out-of-the-[money](../m/money.md) put and call [spreads](../s/spreads.md) to earn a net [credit](../c/credit.md) [premium](../p/premium.md).
- **[Butterfly Spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md)**: Involves buying and selling [multiple](../m/multiple.md) calls or puts with different strike prices but the same expiration to achieve a net [debit](../d/debit.md) or [credit](../c/credit.md) position for limited [risk](../r/risk.md) and limited [profit](../p/profit.md) potential.
- **Ratio [Spreads](../s/spreads.md)**: Involves holding more short positions than long positions in a particular [options](../o/options.md) series, generally creating a more intricate strategy for specific [market](../m/market.md) scenarios.

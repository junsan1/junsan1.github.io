# Option Cycle

[Options](../o/options.md) are financial instruments that give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at a predetermined price within a specified time period. An essential concept within the realm of [options](../o/options.md) trading is the "Option Cycle," which refers to the standardized set of expiration dates available for [options](../o/options.md) on a given stock or [index](../i/index_instrument.md). Understanding the option cycle is crucial for traders and investors as it significantly affects the strategy selection, [premium](../p/premium.md) calculation, and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md).

## Types of Option Cycles

There are three primary option cycles, commonly referred to as Cycle 1, Cycle 2, and Cycle 3. Each [security](../s/security.md) that has [options](../o/options.md) available belongs to one of these cycles, which helps spread out expiration dates more uniformly across the trading calendar year.

1. **Cycle 1 (January Cycle)**: [Options](../o/options.md) in this cycle expire in the months of January, April, July, and October.
2. **Cycle 2 (February Cycle)**: [Options](../o/options.md) in this cycle expire in the months of February, May, August, and November.
3. **Cycle 3 (March Cycle)**: [Options](../o/options.md) in this cycle expire in the months of March, June, September, and December.

Each of these cycles ensures that there is an equitable [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of [options](../o/options.md) expirations every month, providing traders with continuous opportunities to roll positions and manage [risk](../r/risk.md).

## Front Month and Back Months

[Options](../o/options.md) are typically available based on their time to expiration:
- **Front Month (Near-Term)**: This is the closest expiration month. It is the current month if an [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md) has not yet passed. For example, if today is February 1, 2023, and the February expiration has not yet occurred, then the February 2023 option is the front-month option.
  
- **Back Months (Long-Term)**: These are [options](../o/options.md) that expire in farther months. These could be the next one, two, or several months out, depending on the chosen option cycle and the [trader](../t/trader.md)'s strategy.

## LEAPS (Long-Term Equity Anticipation Securities)

Apart from standard cycle [options](../o/options.md), LEAPS (Long-Term [Equity](../e/equity.md) Anticipation Securities) are [options](../o/options.md) contracts with extended expiration dates, typically ranging from one year to three years from the [issue](../i/issue.md) date. They allow investors to adopt a long-term view of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) and [hedge](../h/hedge.md) positions over a longer timeframe.

## Expiration and the Role of Weeklies

[Options](../o/options.md) typically expire on the third Friday of the expiration month; if the third Friday is a holiday, expiration occurs on the Thursday immediately before. Recently, Weeklies have gained popularity. These are [options](../o/options.md) that expire weekly, [offering](../o/offering.md) traders greater flexibility and opportunities for [short-term trading](../s/short-term_trading.md) strategies.

## Option Expiration Process

The option expiration process is critical to understand:

1. **Automatic [Exercise](../e/exercise.md)**: In-the-[money](../m/money.md) [options](../o/options.md) ([options](../o/options.md) with [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md)) are usually exercised automatically by the [broker](../b/broker.md). The holder of an in-the-[money](../m/money.md) option [will](../w/will.md) be assigned the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).
2. **Expiration and Settlement**: [Out-of-the-money options](../o/out-of-the-money_options.md) ([options](../o/options.md) with no [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md)) expire worthless.

Knowing the specific details of expiration, including cut-off times and settlement processes, helps traders make informed decisions.

## Impact on Trading Strategies

Different types of option cycles influence various [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), such as:

1. **Covered Calls and Protective Puts**: Engaging in these strategies would require understanding the available expiration cycles for the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock.
2. **Calendar [Spreads](../s/spreads.md)**: Involves buying and selling [options](../o/options.md) with different expiration dates to exploit [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) and [volatility](../v/volatility.md).
3. **Iron Condors and Butterflies**: These multi-[leg](../l/leg.md) [options](../o/options.md) strategies also [demand](../d/demand.md) a thorough insight into the option expiration cycles.

## Technological Tools and Resources

In modern trading, sophisticated technology tools are available to assist traders in managing option cycles effectively:

1. **Trading Platforms**: Brokerages [offer](../o/offer.md) platforms with real-time data and analytics to track option cycles.
2. **Financial Calculators**: These tools help in understanding [Greeks](../g/greeks.md) ([Delta](../d/delta.md), [Gamma](../g/gamma.md), [Theta](../t/theta.md), [Vega](../v/vega.md)) across different expiration months.
3. **APIs and Algorithms**: Advanced traders use APIs and [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) systems to automate their strategies considering cycle rules. Fintech firms such as [Robinhood](https://www.robinhood.com) and [Interactive Brokers](https://www.interactivebrokers.com) provide extensive APIs for this purpose.

## Conclusion

The option cycle is an integral aspect of [options](../o/options.md) trading, ensuring a systematic approach to expiration dates. This cyclic pattern of expiration influences various [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) and [risk management techniques](../r/risk_management_techniques.md). Leveraging modern trading platforms and technological tools can significantly enhance traders' ability to navigate the intricacies of option cycles effectively.

# Operating Revenue

Operating [revenue](../r/revenue.md) is a fundamental financial metric that reflects the [income](../i/income.md) generated from a company's core [business](../b/business.md) operations. For companies, this form of [revenue](../r/revenue.md) is essential as it represents the total amount earned from their [primary market](../p/primary_market.md) activities, such as the [sale](../s/sale.md) of goods or providing services before any costs or expenses are deducted. Understanding operating [revenue](../r/revenue.md) is critical for investors, analysts, and [business](../b/business.md) managers because it offers insights into the company's [operational efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md) and [market](../m/market.md) [demand](../d/demand.md) for its products or services.

## Definition and Importance
Operating [revenue](../r/revenue.md), also known as sales or [turnover](../t/turnover.md), is an [accounting](../a/accounting.md) term that pertains to the [income](../i/income.md) earned from normal [business activities](../b/business_activities.md). It excludes non-operating revenues, which come from secondary sources like [interest](../i/interest.md), dividends, or the [sale](../s/sale.md) of assets. For example, a retailer’s operating [revenue](../r/revenue.md) arises from selling merchandise, while a software company's operating [revenue](../r/revenue.md) comes from licensing its products or services.

### Why Operating Revenue Matters:
1. **Primary Growth [Indicator](../i/indicator.md)**: A consistent increase in operating [revenue](../r/revenue.md) suggests that the company is growing its [market share](../m/market_share.md) and is potentially well-received by its customers.
2. **Operational Focus**: By isolating [income](../i/income.md) from core activities, stakeholders can evaluate the company's performance purely based on its [principal](../p/principal.md) [business activities](../b/business_activities.md).
3. **Investment Decisions**: Investors look at operating [revenue](../r/revenue.md) to determine a company's viability and profitability purely from its core operations. This is beneficial for making informed investment choices.
4. **[Comparative Analysis](../c/comparative_analysis.md)**: It helps in comparing companies within the same [industry](../i/industry.md) by providing a standard metric unsullied by outside investments and [asset](../a/asset.md) sales.

## Components of Operating Revenue
Operating [revenue](../r/revenue.md) is usually broken down into different categories based on the company’s nature and [industry](../i/industry.md):

1. **Product Sales**: For [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) and retail companies, this includes all sales generated from the [sale](../s/sale.md) of physical products.
2. **Service [Revenue](../r/revenue.md)**: For service-oriented businesses, this encompasses [income](../i/income.md) from providing services, such as consultancy, rent, and subscriptions.
3. **Contract [Revenue](../r/revenue.md)**: In specific industries like construction, [revenue](../r/revenue.md) from contracts or long-term projects is a significant part of operating [revenue](../r/revenue.md).
4. **[Franchise](../f/franchise.md) Fees**: For companies with [franchise](../f/franchise.md) models, fees from franchisees represent part of the operating [revenue](../r/revenue.md).

## Calculation of Operating Revenue
Operating [revenue](../r/revenue.md) is calculated by multiplying the number of goods or services sold by the price per unit. The basic formula is:

\[ \text{Operating [Revenue](../r/revenue.md)} = \text{Total Units Sold} \times \text{Price Per Unit} \]

For example, if a company sells 10,000 units of a product at $50 each, the operating [revenue](../r/revenue.md) [will](../w/will.md) be:

\[ 10,000 \times 50 = \$500,000 \]

However, this can become more complicated when discounts, returns, and allowances are considered. Thus, companies may report [net sales](../n/net_sales.md) after these adjustments.

## Operating Revenue vs. Non-Operating Revenue
### Operating Revenue:
- Derived from core [business activities](../b/business_activities.md)
- Regular and recurring
- E.g., a supermarket’s sales from groceries

### Non-Operating Revenue:
- Generated from secondary activities
- Often irregular and unpredictable
- E.g., [interest](../i/interest.md) [income](../i/income.md), gains from [asset](../a/asset.md) sales

Focusing on operating [revenue](../r/revenue.md) helps investors and managers understand performance and growth from primary activities without the "[noise](../n/noise.md)" of non-operating factors.

## Reporting Operating Revenue
### Income Statement:
Operating [revenue](../r/revenue.md) is the first line item in the [income statement](../i/income_statement.md). It serves as the starting point for many metrics and ratios.

1. **Gross [Revenue](../r/revenue.md)**: Reflects the total sales before any deductions.
2. **Net [Revenue](../r/revenue.md)**: Reflects sales minus returns, allowances, and discounts.

Below is an example of how operating [revenue](../r/revenue.md) appears in an [income statement](../i/income_statement.md):

```
ABC Company
[Income Statement](../i/income_statement.md)
For the Year Ended December 31, 2023

[Revenue](../r/revenue.md):
  [Gross Sales](../g/gross_sales.md) [Revenue](../r/revenue.md): $1,200,000
  Less: Sales Returns and Allowances: $50,000
  [Net Sales](../n/net_sales.md) [Revenue](../r/revenue.md): $1,150,000

Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): $(700,000)
[Gross Profit](../g/gross_profit.md): $450,000
```

### Segment Reporting:
For diversified companies with [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [business](../b/business.md) units, segment reporting can break down operating [revenue](../r/revenue.md) by each segment to provide more detailed insights.

## Analysis of Operating Revenue
### Trend Analysis:
Analyzing trends over a period (e.g., quarterly or annually) helps in identifying growth patterns, [seasonality](../s/seasonality.md), and [operational efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md).

### Comparative Analysis:
Benchmarking against competitors or [industry](../i/industry.md) standards helps gauge relative performance.

### Profitability Ratios:
1. **[Operating Margin](../o/operating_margin.md)**: This is calculated as [operating income](../o/operating_income.md) (EBIT) divided by operating [revenue](../r/revenue.md), reflecting the [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) of core operations.
   \[
   \text{[Operating Margin](../o/operating_margin.md)} = \frac{\text{[Operating Income](../o/operating_income.md)}}{\text{Operating [Revenue](../r/revenue.md)}}
   \]
2. **[Gross Margin](../g/gross_margin.md)**: This is the [gross profit](../g/gross_profit.md) divided by operating [revenue](../r/revenue.md), showing the cost [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) in producing goods or services.
   \[
   \text{[Gross Margin](../g/gross_margin.md)} = \frac{\text{[Gross Profit](../g/gross_profit.md)}}{\text{Operating [Revenue](../r/revenue.md)}}
   \]

## Key Considerations in Operating Revenue
1. **[Accounting Policies](../a/accounting_policies.md)**: Different [revenue recognition](../r/revenue_recognition.md) criteria can affect reported figures. For instance, companies might recognize [revenue](../r/revenue.md) upon delivery of goods/services or upon receipt of [payment](../p/payment.md).
2. **Economic Factors**: [Inflation](../i/inflation.md), [currency exchange](../c/currency_exchange.md) rates, and [economic cycles](../e/economic_cycles.md) influence sales prices and volumes.
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Adherence to [revenue recognition](../r/revenue_recognition.md) standards such as IFRS 15 or ASC 606 ensures accuracy and [transparency](../t/transparency.md).

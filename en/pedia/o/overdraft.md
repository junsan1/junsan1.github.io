# Overdraft

An overdraft is a [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) that allows an individual or [business](../b/business.md) to withdraw more [money](../m/money.md) from their [bank](../b/bank.md) account than they currently have, effectively borrowing from the [bank](../b/bank.md). It is a form of short-term lending that provides immediate access to cash, often used to manage [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) issues or cover unexpected expenses. 

## Types of Overdrafts

There are two main types of overdrafts:

1. **Authorized Overdrafts**: This occurs when the [bank](../b/bank.md) agrees in advance that the account holder can withdraw more [money](../m/money.md) than is available in their account up to an approved limit. This type usually involves an arrangement [fee](../f/fee.md) and [interest](../i/interest.md) charges, but the terms and rates are discussed and agreed upon in advance.
  
2. **Unauthorized Overdrafts**: This occurs when an account holder withdraws more [money](../m/money.md) than is available without prior arrangement with the [bank](../b/bank.md). Unauthorized overdrafts can be expensive due to high fees and [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, and repeated use can negatively impact the account holder's [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md).

## How Overdrafts Work

When you have an overdraft, your [bank](../b/bank.md) [account balance](../a/account_balance.md) can go below zero, allowing you to use more [money](../m/money.md) than you actually possess. This negative balance is essentially a [loan](../l/loan.md) from the [bank](../b/bank.md), which you [will](../w/will.md) need to repay. The specifics of how an overdraft works can vary depending on the [bank](../b/bank.md)'s policies and the type of account you [hold](../h/hold.md). 

### Key Elements

1. **Overdraft Limit**: This is the maximum amount that can be overdrawn. It is usually set by the [bank](../b/bank.md) and can vary depending on the [customer](../c/customer.md)'s [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) and banking history. 
   
2. **[Interest](../i/interest.md) Rates**: These are the charges for borrowing [money](../m/money.md) through an overdraft. Rates can vary widely between authorized and unauthorized overdrafts.

3. **Fees**: There can be several types of fees associated with overdrafts, including arrangement fees, daily or monthly charges, and fees for exceeding the overdraft limit.

4. **[Repayment](../r/repayment.md)**: The overdrawn amount must be repaid, typically from future deposits into the account. 

## Benefits and Drawbacks

### Benefits 

- **Flexibility**: Overdrafts provide immediate access to extra funds, which can be useful for managing short-term [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) issues.
  
- **No [Collateral](../c/collateral.md) Required**: Overdrafts are unsecured forms of [credit](../c/credit.md), meaning there is no need for [collateral](../c/collateral.md) to obtain them.

- **Lower Costs**: When compared to payday loans or [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) cash advances, authorized overdrafts can be a more cost-effective solution for short-term funding needs.

### Drawbacks 

- **High Costs for Unauthorized Use**: Unauthorized overdrafts can be very expensive due to high [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and fees.
  
- **[Risk](../r/risk.md) of [Debt](../d/debt.md)**: Continuous reliance on overdrafts can lead to a cycle of [debt](../d/debt.md) that becomes difficult to break.

- **Impact on [Credit Score](../c/credit_score.md)**: Frequent use or abuse of overdrafts can negatively affect your [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md).

## Overdraft Protection

Banks often [offer](../o/offer.md) [overdraft protection](../o/overdraft_protection.md) services, which are designed to prevent account holders from incurring unauthorized overdraft fees. Here are some common forms of [overdraft protection](../o/overdraft_protection.md):

1. **Transfer from Savings**: Automatically transferring [money](../m/money.md) from a [linked savings account](../l/linked_savings_account.md) when the [checking account](../c/checking_account.md) balance is insufficient.
  
2. **Overdraft [Loan](../l/loan.md)**: Providing a small [loan](../l/loan.md) instead of allowing the account to become overdrawn.
  
3. **[Credit Card](../c/credit_card.md) Link**: Linking a [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) to the account to cover overdrafts.

## Regulatory Landscape

Different countries have varying regulations regarding overdrafts.

### United States
The Federal Reserve's Regulation E requires banks to obtain explicit consent from customers to provide overdraft services for [debit](../d/debit.md) card transactions and ATM withdrawals.

### United Kingdom
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has introduced rules to make overdrafts simpler, including a single [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) for all overdrafts and a ban on fixed daily or monthly fees.

## FinTech and Overdraft Alternatives

The emergence of Financial Technology (FinTech) companies has led to the development of alternative solutions to traditional overdrafts. These include:

1. **[Peer-to-Peer Lending](../p/peer-to-peer_lending.md)**: Platforms that connect borrowers with lenders willing to provide short-term loans.
  
2. **Budgeting Apps**: Apps that help manage finances and alert users when they are at [risk](../r/risk.md) of overdrawing their accounts.
  
3. **Payday Advance Services**: FinTech companies [offer](../o/offer.md) payday advance services where employees can access earned wages before the actual payday.

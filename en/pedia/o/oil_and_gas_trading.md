# Oil and Gas Trading

Oil and gas trading forms a critical segment of the global commodities [market](../m/market.md), facilitating the buying and selling of [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md), natural gas, and associated products like refined fuels. This sector not only impacts global energy supplies but also influences the prices of myriad other commodities and sectors.

## Basics of Oil and Gas Trading

### Crude Oil Types

1. **West Texas Intermediate (WTI)**: A light, sweet [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md) traded primarily on the New York Mercantile [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (NYMEX). It is a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for US oil prices.
2. **Brent Crude**: Sourced from the North Sea, Brent is the global [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for oil prices. It’s traded on the Intercontinental [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (ICE).
3. **Other Varieties**: Other less prominent crude oils include Dubai Crude, found in the Persian Gulf, and OPEC Reference Basket, which is a [weighted average](../w/weighted_average.md) of oils from several OPEC countries.

### Natural Gas Benchmarks

1. **[Henry Hub](../h/henry_hub.md)**: The pricing point for natural gas [futures](../f/futures.md) traded on the NYMEX, named after a pipeline junction in Louisiana.
2. **NBP (National Balancing Point)**: The [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) in the UK, used for natural gas trading in Europe.
3. **TTF (Title Transfer [Facility](../f/facility.md))**: The primary natural gas [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) in the Netherlands, widely used within Europe.

## Trading Mechanisms

### Spot Trading
Spot trading involves the purchase or [sale](../s/sale.md) of commodities for immediate delivery. In the oil and gas [market](../m/market.md), this usually means the [physical delivery](../p/physical_delivery_in_trading.md) of the [commodity](../c/commodity.md) within a few days of the [trade](../t/trade.md) date.

### Futures and Options
The backbone of the oil and gas trading sector, [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) allow traders to buy or sell a specific quantity of a [commodity](../c/commodity.md) at a predetermined price at a future date. [Options](../o/options.md) provide the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell at a specific price.

### Swaps and Derivatives
Financial instruments like swaps allow for the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) of financial outcomes without the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [commodity](../c/commodity.md). For instance, a company worried about gas price fluctuations might enter into a [swap](../s/swap.md) to pay a fixed price in place of the actual fluctuating [market price](../m/market_price.md).

# Oil and Gas Trading

Oil and gas trading forms a critical segment of the global commodities market, facilitating the buying and selling of crude oil, natural gas, and associated products like refined fuels. This sector not only impacts global energy supplies but also influences the prices of myriad other commodities and sectors.

## Basics of Oil and Gas Trading

### Crude Oil Types

1. **West Texas Intermediate (WTI)**: A light, sweet crude oil traded primarily on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). It is a benchmark for US oil prices.
2. **Brent Crude**: Sourced from the North Sea, Brent is the global benchmark for oil prices. It’s traded on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE).
3. **Other Varieties**: Other less prominent crude oils include Dubai Crude, found in the Persian Gulf, and OPEC Reference Basket, which is a weighted average of oils from several OPEC countries.

### Natural Gas Benchmarks

1. **Henry Hub**: The pricing point for natural gas futures traded on the NYMEX, named after a pipeline junction in Louisiana.
2. **NBP (National Balancing Point)**: The benchmark in the UK, used for natural gas trading in Europe.
3. **TTF (Title Transfer Facility)**: The primary natural gas benchmark in the Netherlands, widely used within Europe.

## Trading Mechanisms

### Spot Trading
Spot trading involves the purchase or sale of commodities for immediate delivery. In the oil and gas market, this usually means the physical delivery of the commodity within a few days of the trade date.

### Futures and Options
The backbone of the oil and gas trading sector, [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) allow traders to buy or sell a specific quantity of a commodity at a predetermined price at a future date. Options provide the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell at a specific price.

### Swaps and Derivatives
Financial instruments like swaps allow for the exchange of financial outcomes without the exchange of the underlying commodity. For instance, a company worried about gas price fluctuations might enter into a swap to pay a fixed price in place of the actual fluctuating market price.

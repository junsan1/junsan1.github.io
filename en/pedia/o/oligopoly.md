# Oligopoly

An oligopoly is a [market](../m/market.md) structure characterized by a small number of firms which dominate the [market](../m/market.md). Due to this limited competition, each [firm](../f/firm.md) has significant influence over the [market](../m/market.md) prices and decisions. The actions of one [firm](../f/firm.md) in an oligopolistic [market](../m/market.md) can substantially affect the others, and this interdependence typically leads to various forms of strategic behavior and [collusion](../c/collusion.md).

## Characteristics of Oligopoly

1. **Few Sellers**: The [market](../m/market.md) is controlled by a small number of firms. Each [firm](../f/firm.md) holds a substantial [market share](../m/market_share.md), making them large enough to influence [market](../m/market.md) prices.
2. **Interdependence**: Firms in an oligopoly are interdependent; decisions made by one [firm](../f/firm.md) affect the others. For instance, if one [firm](../f/firm.md) lowers its prices, others might follow to avoid losing their [market share](../m/market_share.md).
3. **[Barriers to Entry](../b/barriers_to_entry.md)**: High entry barriers prevent new competitors from entering the [market](../m/market.md) easily. These can include significant [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements, technological know-how, control over essential resources, and regulatory hurdles.
4. **[Product Differentiation](../p/product_differentiation.md)**: Products may be differentiated or homogeneous. In some oligopolies, firms [offer](../o/offer.md) products that are virtually identical (e.g., cement), while in others, they may differentiate their products through branding and quality (e.g., automobiles).
5. **Non-Price Competition**: Firms often compete using methods other than price, such as [marketing](../m/marketing.md), advertising, product innovation, and brand-building activities.

## Types of Oligopoly

- **Pure or Perfect Oligopoly**: This type exists when the firms produce homogeneous products. For example, industries like cement, steel, and chemicals often operate within pure oligopolies.
- **Imperfect or Differentiated Oligopoly**: This occurs when firms produce differentiated products. Examples include the automotive [industry](../i/industry.md), consumer electronics, and airline services.

## Models of Oligopoly

### Cournot Model 

Developed by French [economist](../e/economist.md) Antoine Augustin Cournot in 1838, the Cournot model describes an [industry](../i/industry.md) in which firms compete on the quantity of output they decide to produce. Each [firm](../f/firm.md) makes its production decision based on the output level chosen by its rivals; the [firm](../f/firm.md)'s objective is to maximize its [profit](../p/profit.md) in the context of its rival's production quantity.

### Bertrand Model

Named after Joseph Bertrand, this model assumes that firms compete on price rather than the quantity of output. In a Bertrand competition, each [firm](../f/firm.md) believes its rival [will](../w/will.md) keep its price fixed, and consequently, they lower prices to attract customers, often leading to a scenario where prices could fall to the level of marginal cost in the case of homogeneous products.

### Stackelberg Model

The Stackelberg model considers scenarios in which one [firm](../f/firm.md) becomes the leader and sets output before the other firms, which then follow as followers. The leader [firm](../f/firm.md) determines its output to maximize [profit](../p/profit.md) given the expected response from the follower firms.

### Kinked Demand Curve Model

Developed as an explanation of price rigidity often observed in oligopolistic markets, the kinked [demand curve](../d/demand_curve.md) model assumes that firms face a [demand curve](../d/demand_curve.md) that has a kink at the current [price level](../p/price_level.md). If a [firm](../f/firm.md) increases its price, others [will](../w/will.md) not follow, resulting in a significant loss of [demand](../d/demand.md); however, if it lowers its price, others [will](../w/will.md) match the reduction, leading to only a minor [gain](../g/gain.md) in [market share](../m/market_share.md). This results in a kink in the [demand curve](../d/demand_curve.md) and a corresponding discontinuity in the marginal [revenue](../r/revenue.md) curve.

## Oligopoly in Practice

### Market Examples

1. **Automobile [Industry](../i/industry.md)**: Dominated by a few major players like Toyota, Ford, General Motors, Volkswagen, and BMW.
2. **Telecommunications**: Many regions have a few dominant firms like AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile in the U.S.
3. **Airlines**: The [market](../m/market.md) is often dominated by major airlines such as American Airlines, [Delta](../d/delta.md), United Airlines, and Southwest in the U.S., with similar structures existing worldwide.
4. **Technology**: Companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon dominate the tech [industry](../i/industry.md).
5. **Oil and Gas**: Major players include ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, BP, and Chevron.

### Strategic Behavior

Firms in an oligopolistic [market](../m/market.md) engage in various forms of strategic behavior to optimize their [market](../m/market.md) position and profitability. This includes:
- **[Collusion](../c/collusion.md)**: This can be either formal (explicit [collusion](../c/collusion.md) or cartel formation) or informal (tacit understandings). An example of formal [collusion](../c/collusion.md) is OPEC in the oil [industry](../i/industry.md).
- **[Price Leadership](../p/price_leadership.md)**: A dominant [firm](../f/firm.md) often sets the price, and other firms follow suit, avoiding price wars.
- **Non-Price Competition**: Incentives like [customer](../c/customer.md) loyalty programs, advertising campaigns, and [product differentiation](../p/product_differentiation.md) are common.
- **Product Bundling**: Companies may bundle products together to create [value](../v/value.md) for customers and to reduce competition.
- **Strategic Alliances and Mergers**: Firms often engage in mergers and acquisitions to consolidate their [market power](../m/market_power.md) and reduce competition.

## Regulatory Concerns

Governments and regulatory agencies worldwide carefully monitor and regulate oligopolistic markets to prevent anti-competitive practices and to protect consumer interests. [Antitrust](../a/antitrust.md) laws are enforced to prevent explicit [collusion](../c/collusion.md), mergers that significantly reduce competition, and other practices that can harm the [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md).

### Key Regulatory Bodies
- **Federal [Trade](../t/trade.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (FTC)**: In the United States, this body oversees corporate practices to promote consumer protection and eliminate harmful anticompetitive practices.
- **European [Commission](../c/commission.md)**: In the [European Union](../e/european_union_(eu).md), it monitors and enforces competition laws to ensure fair competition.
- **Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)**: In the UK, the CMA works to promote competition and curb anti-competitive activities.

## Implications for Financial Markets

Understanding oligopolistic [market](../m/market.md) structures is critical for investors and financial analysts as it impacts various aspects of corporate performance and [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md):

- **Stock Performance**: [Stocks](../s/stock.md) of firms in an oligopoly can be relatively more stable due to reduced price competition and higher [profit margins](../p/profit_margins_in_trading.md). However, regulatory risks may also impact their valuations.
- **Mergers and Acquisitions**: M&A activity in oligopolistic markets can lead to significant changes in [market](../m/market.md) structure and [firm](../f/firm.md) valuations.
- **[Market](../m/market.md) Analysis**: Financial analysts often study the strategic behavior and [market](../m/market.md) positioning of firms in oligopolies to forecast future performance and [market](../m/market.md) trends.
- **Investment Strategies**: Investment decisions in such markets often consider the impact of potential regulatory changes, competitive dynamics, and [market share](../m/market_share.md) stability.

Investors can use tools such as [market](../m/market.md) concentration ratios and the Herfindahl-Hirschman [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (HHI) to gauge the level of competition within a [market](../m/market.md).

Understanding and analyzing oligopolies are fundamental for making informed decisions, whether one is engaging in algot trading, [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md), or broader [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md). These [market](../m/market.md) structures, with their unique characteristics and behaviors, [offer](../o/offer.md) both opportunities and challenges to those involved in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and trading.

# Options Arbitrage Strategies

[Options](../o/options.md) [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategies are trading techniques that exploit price inefficiencies between related securities in [options](../o/options.md) markets to generate [risk](../r/risk.md)-free profits. These strategies are a type of advanced [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) typically used by professional traders and [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds. [Options](../o/options.md) themselves are financial instruments that derive [value](../v/value.md) from an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), such as [stocks](../s/stock.md), indices, or commodities. Below, we [will](../w/will.md) explore the most popular types of [options](../o/options.md) [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategies, along with examples and explanations of how they work.

### 1. Definition and Overview
[Options](../o/options.md) [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) involves entering [multiple](../m/multiple.md) simultaneous trades to take advantage of price discrepancies in the [options](../o/options.md) [market](../m/market.md). The overall goal is to lock in a [profit](../p/profit.md) without assuming any directional [risk](../r/risk.md) on the [underlying security](../u/underlying_security.md). This might involve trading [options](../o/options.md) on the same [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) but with different strike prices, expiration dates, or in different markets.

### 2. Types of Options Arbitrage Strategies

#### 2.1. Conversion Arbitrage
Conversion [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) involves the creation of a synthetic long position in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). This position is created by purchasing a [call option](../c/call_option.md) and selling a [put option](../p/put.md), while simultaneously shorting the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) (or holding a short position). 

**Steps:**
1. Buy a [call option](../c/call_option.md).
2. Sell a [put option](../p/put.md) (both with the same [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) and [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md)).
3. Short the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) (or keep the short position [open](../o/open.md)).

*Example:*
Assume Stock XYZ is trading at $100. You could buy a [call option](../c/call_option.md) with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $100 for a [premium](../p/premium.md) of $5, sell a [put option](../p/put.md) with the same [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) for a [premium](../p/premium.md) of $5, and short the stock at $100. The positions effectively cancel out [market risk](../m/market_risk.md), locking in the premiums collected.

#### 2.2. Reverse Conversion Arbitrage
The reverse conversion [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategy is essentially the opposite of conversion [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md). It involves the creation of a synthetic short position in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). This position is created by selling a [call option](../c/call_option.md), buying a [put option](../p/put.md), while simultaneously holding a long position in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

**Steps:**
1. Sell a [call option](../c/call_option.md).
2. Buy a [put option](../p/put.md) (both with the same [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) and [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md)).
3. Long the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) (or [hold](../h/hold.md) an equivalent long position).

*Example:*
Assume Stock XYZ is trading at $100. You sell a [call option](../c/call_option.md) with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $100 for a [premium](../p/premium.md) of $5, buy a [put option](../p/put.md) with the same [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) for a [premium](../p/premium.md) of $5, and [hold](../h/hold.md) the stock at $100. Similar to conversion [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), this strategy locks in the collected premiums.

#### 2.3. Box Spread
A [box spread](../b/box_spread.md) [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategy is a more sophisticated approach. It involves establishing a combination of a [bull call spread](../b/bull_call_spread.md) and a [bear put spread](../b/bear_put_spread.md), creating a [risk](../r/risk.md)-free position if executed correctly.

**Steps:**
1. Buy a [call option](../c/call_option.md) and sell another [call option](../c/call_option.md) with a higher [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) ([Bull Call Spread](../b/bull_call_spread.md)).
2. Buy a [put option](../p/put.md) and sell another [put option](../p/put.md) with a higher [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) ([Bear Put Spread](../b/bear_put_spread.md)).
3. Ensure all [options](../o/options.md) have the same expiration dates.

*Example:*
Consider Stock XYZ:
- Buy a [call option](../c/call_option.md) with a $100 [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).
- Sell a [call option](../c/call_option.md) with a $110 [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).
- Buy a [put option](../p/put.md) with a $110 [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).
- Sell a [put option](../p/put.md) with a $100 [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).

The goal is to exploit mispriced [options](../o/options.md) to [gain](../g/gain.md) riskless [profit](../p/profit.md), adjusting the combinations to lock in a guaranteed [profit](../p/profit.md) made from discrepancies.

#### 2.4. Butterfly Spread Arbitrage
[Butterfly spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md) [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) involves creating a position that has no [risk](../r/risk.md) and minimal cost with the aim of capturing a guaranteed [profit](../p/profit.md) if prices converge to estimated levels.

**Steps:**
1. Buy one “in-the-[money](../m/money.md)” [call option](../c/call_option.md).
2. Sell two at-the-[money](../m/money.md) call [options](../o/options.md).
3. Buy one “out-of-the-[money](../m/money.md)” [call option](../c/call_option.md).

*Example:*
For Stock XYZ at $100:
- Buy one in-the-[money](../m/money.md) call with a strike at $90.
- Sell two calls with a strike at $100.
- Buy one out-of-the-[money](../m/money.md) call with a strike at $110.

If the [trade](../t/trade.md) setup is executed at a net zero cost or a small [credit](../c/credit.md), any contraction in implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md) or [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) [will](../w/will.md) ensure [profit](../p/profit.md).

### 3. Why Options Arbitrage Exists
[Options](../o/options.md) [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) exists due to inefficiencies in the markets. Such inefficiencies can be caused by a variety of factors including:
- Disparities between pricing models.
- Temporary [demand](../d/demand.md) and [supply](../s/supply.md) imbalances.
- [Execution](../e/execution.md) time lags.
- Differences in [volatility](../v/volatility.md) assumptions.

### 4. Risks Involved
While [options](../o/options.md) [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) might sound [risk](../r/risk.md)-free theoretically, practical risks do exist:
- [Execution risk](../e/execution_risk.md): Failing to execute all legs of an [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) [trade](../t/trade.md) simultaneously can expose a [trader](../t/trader.md) to [market risk](../m/market_risk.md).
- [Liquidity risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md): Not being able to find a counter-party can prevent the completion of the [trade](../t/trade.md).
- [Model risk](../m/model_risk.md): Reliance on inaccurate pricing models can result in miscalculated trades.

### 5. Tools and Platforms
Professional traders use advanced tools and platforms to automate and manage these strategies. Some prominent platforms include:
- **[Interactive Brokers](../i/interactive_brokers.md)**: [Interactive Brokers](https://www.interactivebrokers.com)
- **[ThinkOrSwim](../t/thinkorswim.md) by TD [Ameritrade](../a/ameritrade.md)**: [TD Ameritrade](https://www.tdameritrade.com/tools-and-platforms/thinkorswim.page)

### 6. Conclusion
[Options](../o/options.md) [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategies are a sophisticated, nuanced approach to trading that [leverage](../l/leverage.md) [market](../m/market.md) inefficiencies to secure riskless profits. While theoretically straightforward, effective implementation requires [robust](../r/robust.md) tools, quick [execution](../e/execution.md), and deep [market](../m/market.md) knowledge. As with any financial strategy, understanding the intricacies and potential pitfalls is crucial for success.

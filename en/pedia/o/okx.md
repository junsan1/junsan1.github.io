### Margin Trading

[Margin trading](../m/margin_trading.md) enables users to borrow funds to [trade](../t/trade.md) larger positions than their initial [capital](../c/capital.md) would allow. This can amplify potential profits but also increases the [risk](../r/risk.md) of significant losses.

### Futures and Perpetual Contracts

OKX offers [futures](../f/futures.md) and perpetual contracts for different digital assets, allowing traders to speculate on the future price movements without holding the actual [asset](../a/asset.md). These contracts come with different expiration dates, and perpetual contracts can be held indefinitely.

### Options Trading

[Options](../o/options.md) trading is available on OKX, providing traders with additional tools to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) and speculate on the price movements of cryptocurrencies.

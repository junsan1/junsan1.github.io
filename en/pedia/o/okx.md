## Trading Features

OKX offers a wide range of trading features that cater to both novice and experienced traders. Some of the key trading functionalities include:

### Spot Trading

Spot trading on OKX allows users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies at real-time prices. The platform supports a vast array of trading pairs, with BTC, ETH, and other major cryptocurrencies being the most commonly traded.

### Margin Trading

Margin trading enables users to borrow funds to trade larger positions than their initial capital would allow. This can amplify potential profits but also increases the risk of significant losses. OKX provides various leverage options, accommodating different risk appetites.

### Futures and Perpetual Contracts

OKX offers futures and perpetual contracts for different digital assets, allowing traders to speculate on the future price movements without holding the actual asset. These contracts come with different expiration dates, and perpetual contracts can be held indefinitely.

### Options Trading

Options trading is available on OKX, providing traders with additional tools to hedge and speculate on the price movements of cryptocurrencies. Options can help manage risk effectively by allowing traders to lock in prices for future transactions.

## Security Measures

Security is a paramount concern for OKX. The platform implements advanced security protocols to protect user assets and data. Key measures include:

### Cold and Hot Wallets

OKX employs a combination of cold and hot wallets to store user funds. Cold wallets are offline and secure from online threats, while hot wallets are used for day-to-day transactions but contain a minimal portion of funds.

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Users are encouraged to enable 2FA to add an extra layer of security to their accounts. This requires an additional verification step using a mobile app or email.

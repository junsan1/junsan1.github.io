# Over-The-Counter Derivatives

Over-The-Counter (OTC) [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) represent a segment of the financial [market](../m/market.md) where secondary securities are traded directly between two parties, outside of formal exchanges. These instruments are tailored to meet the specific needs and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) requirements of the contracting parties. OTC [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) encompass a wide [range](../r/range.md) of financial contracts, including swaps, forwards, [options](../o/options.md), and others. This [market](../m/market.md)'s flexibility allows for customization but also presents greater [counterparty risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md). Understanding the mechanics, types, risks, and regulatory landscape of OTC [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) is crucial for participants involved in these complex financial instruments.

## Overview of OTC Derivatives

### Definition and Nature

OTC [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) are contracts that derive their [value](../v/value.md) from an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), [index](../i/index.md), or rate, and are negotiated and traded directly between two parties without going through a centralized [exchange](../e/exchange.md). These [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) include:

- **Swaps:** Contracts where two parties [exchange](../e/exchange.md) cash flows or other financial instruments. A common example is [interest rate swaps](../i/interest_rate_swaps.md) where fixed rate payments are exchanged for floating rate payments.
- **Forwards:** Agreements to buy or sell an [asset](../a/asset.md) at a future date for a price specified today. Unlike [futures](../f/futures.md), forwards are not standardized and can be customized to the needs of the parties involved.
- **[Options](../o/options.md):** Contracts granting the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an [asset](../a/asset.md) at a predetermined price before or at expiration.
- **Other [Derivatives](../d/derivatives.md):** This includes [exotic options](../e/exotic_options.md), [credit default swaps](../c/credit_default_swaps.md) (CDS), and other structured products developed to meet specific financial needs.

### Market Structure

The OTC [market](../m/market.md) is decentralized, with transactions occurring directly between parties, often facilitated by brokers or through electronic trading platforms. Transactions are typically negotiated via phone, email, or electronic [trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md), contrasting with the highly structured and standardized nature of [exchange](../e/exchange.md)-traded [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md).

### Participants

Participants in the OTC [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) [market](../m/market.md) include:

- **[Hedge](../h/hedge.md) Funds:** Engage in OTC [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) for speculative purposes and to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) [risk](../r/risk.md).
- **Commercial Banks:** Act as major [market](../m/market.md) makers and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) providers, [offering](../o/offering.md) customized financial products to their clients.
- **Corporations:** Use OTC [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) for hedging risks related to their core [business activities](../b/business_activities.md), such as [foreign exchange risk](../f/foreign_exchange_risk.md) or [commodity](../c/commodity.md) price fluctuations.
- **Institutional Investors:** Utilize these instruments for [portfolio diversification](../p/portfolio_diversification.md) and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md).

## Types of OTC Derivatives

### Swaps

#### Interest Rate Swaps

[Interest rate swaps](../i/interest_rate_swaps.md) involve exchanging fixed-rate [interest](../i/interest.md) payments for floating-rate payments based on a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) such as LIBOR. These contracts are commonly used to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md) or to adjust the [interest](../i/interest.md) exposure of a portfolio.

#### Currency Swaps

These swaps entail the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) of [principal](../p/principal.md) and [interest](../i/interest.md) payments in different currencies. They are used by businesses and investors to manage [currency](../c/currency.md) [risk](../r/risk.md) and access foreign [capital markets](../c/capital_markets.md).

#### Credit Default Swaps (CDS)

CDS contracts act as a form of [insurance](../i/insurance.md) against the [default](../d/default.md) of an [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [debt instrument](../d/debt_instrument.md). The buyer of a CDS pays a regular [premium](../p/premium.md) to the seller, who compensates the buyer if the [underlying debt](../u/underlying_debt.md) defaults.

### Forwards

#### Currency Forwards

[Currency](../c/currency.md) forwards are customized contracts to buy or sell a specific amount of a foreign [currency](../c/currency.md) at a pre-agreed rate on a future date. They are widely used for hedging [foreign exchange risk](../f/foreign_exchange_risk.md) in international [trade](../t/trade.md) and investment.

#### Commodity Forwards

Similar to [currency](../c/currency.md) forwards, these contracts fix the purchase or [sale](../s/sale.md) price of a [commodity](../c/commodity.md) at a future date. They help producers and consumers stabilize [revenue](../r/revenue.md) and costs amidst volatile price movements.

### Options

#### OTC Options

[OTC options](../o/otc_options.md) can be tailor-made to suit the specific needs of the contracting parties, in contrast to the standardized [options](../o/options.md) traded on exchanges. These can include [options](../o/options.md) on [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, currencies, and commodities.

#### Exotic Options

[Exotic options](../e/exotic_options.md) have more complex features than standard vanilla [options](../o/options.md). Examples include barrier [options](../o/options.md), which activate or deactivate once the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) reaches a certain price, and binary [options](../o/options.md), which pay out a fixed amount or nothing at expiration based on the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price.

## Risks Associated with OTC Derivatives

### Counterparty Risk

The decentralized nature of OTC [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) exposes parties to [counterparty risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md)â€”the [risk](../r/risk.md) that the [counterparty](../c/counterparty.md) [will](../w/will.md) [default](../d/default.md) on the contractual [obligations](../o/obligation.md). This [risk](../r/risk.md) was notably highlighted during the 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) when major institutions faced significant exposures.

### Market Risk

[Market risk](../m/market_risk.md) involves potential losses due to adverse movements in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) prices, [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, or [currency exchange](../c/currency_exchange.md) rates.

### Liquidity Risk

The customized and less transparent nature of OTC [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) can lead to [liquidity risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md), making it difficult to enter or exit positions without significantly affecting [market](../m/market.md) prices.

### Operational Risk

Managing OTC [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) involves complex processes that can lead to errors, miscommunication, or system failures, adding to [operational risk](../o/operational_risk.md).

## Regulatory Landscape

The OTC [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) [market](../m/market.md) is subject to varying levels of regulation across different jurisdictions. Key regulatory frameworks include:

### Dodd-Frank Act (USA)

The [Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act](../d/dodd-frank_wall_street_reform_and_consumer_protection_act.md) introduced regulatory changes to enhance [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and reduce [systemic risk](../s/systemic_risk.md) in the OTC [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) [market](../m/market.md). Key provisions include:

- Requirement for central [clearing](../c/clearing.md) of standardized OTC [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md).
- Mandatory reporting of OTC [derivative](../d/derivative.md) transactions to [swap](../s/swap.md) data repositories.
- Imposition of [capital](../c/capital.md) and [margin](../m/margin.md) requirements on major [swap](../s/swap.md) participants and dealers.

### European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)

EMIR aims to increase stability in the OTC [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) [market](../m/market.md) in the [European Union](../e/european_union_(eu).md) by:

- Requiring central [clearing](../c/clearing.md) of standardized OTC [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md).
- Mandating the reporting of transactions to [trade](../t/trade.md) repositories.
- Implementing [risk](../r/risk.md) mitigation techniques for non-cleared OTC [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md).

### Basel III

The [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md) framework introduces stricter [capital](../c/capital.md) and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) requirements for banks, affecting their participation in the OTC [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) [market](../m/market.md) by ensuring they [hold](../h/hold.md) sufficient [capital](../c/capital.md) against potential exposures.

## Role of Technology in OTC Derivatives

### Electronic Trading Platforms

The evolution of electronic trading platforms has enhanced [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and [transparency](../t/transparency.md) in the OTC [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) [market](../m/market.md). Platforms such as [Bloomberg](../b/bloomberg.md), Tradeweb, and [MarketAxess](../m/marketaxess.md) facilitate [trade](../t/trade.md) [execution](../e/execution.md) and connectivity among [market](../m/market.md) participants.

### Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)

[Blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) and DLT [offer](../o/offer.md) potential improvements in [transparency](../t/transparency.md), [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md), and [security](../s/security.md) for OTC [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) trading and post-[trade](../t/trade.md) processes. These technologies can help streamline settlement, reduce [counterparty risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md), and ensure real-time reporting.

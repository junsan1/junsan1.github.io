# Online Banking

Online banking, also known as internet banking or e-banking, is an electronic payment system that enables customers of a bank or other financial institution to conduct a range of financial transactions through the financial institution's website. Online banking offers features such as account balances, transactions histories, fund transfers, bill payments, and investment opportunities, making it a crucial element of the modern financial ecosystem.

## History of Online Banking 

The concept of online banking can be traced back to the early 1980s when it was first introduced by banks in the UK and the United States. Initially, it was limited to basic functionalities such as viewing account balances and recent transactions. However, with advancements in technology, online banking has transformed into a comprehensive platform providing a full suite of financial services.

## Common Features of Online Banking

1. **Account Management**: Customers can manage their bank accounts remotely, including checking balances, viewing transaction history, and monitoring expenditures.
2. **Fund Transfers**: Users can transfer funds between their accounts, to other users within the same bank, or to accounts in different banks.
3. **Bill Payments**: Online banking allows users to pay utility bills, credit card bills, and other recurring payments electronically.
4. **Loan Management**: Customers can view their loan accounts, check remaining balances, and make payments.
5. **Investment Services**: Online banking platforms offer services related to investments in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and other assets.
6. **Customer Service**: Direct communication through secure messaging for resolving issues or getting information.

## Security Measures in Online Banking

Online banking employs several security measures to ensure the safety of users' information and transactions:

1. **Encryption**: Use of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption to protect data during transmission.
2. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Requiring two forms of identification, such as a password and a text message code.
3. **Biometric Authentication**: Implementing advanced methods like fingerprint or facial recognition to enhance security.

This deep dive will cover various facets of OTPPB, including its history, investment strategies, governance structure, and its significance in the financial world.

## History and Background 

Founded in 1990, OTPPB was created to manage the pension assets of Ontario teachers independently from the provincial government. Before its establishment, pension funds were traditionally managed by government entities, often leading to perceived inefficiencies and lack of robust investment strategies. The creation of OTPPB aimed to establish a more agile and market-oriented approach to pension fund management.

## Governance Structure

OTPPB operates with a Board of Directors appointed jointly by the Ontario Teachers' Federation (OTF) and the Government of Ontario. OTPPB's governance structure is designed to balance the interests of its multiple stakeholders. The board includes professionals with expertise in various fields, including finance, law, and business, ensuring they possess the skills necessary to oversee a large, complex pension fund.

- **Public Equities**: OTPPB invests in equities listed on stock exchanges globally. These investments are diversified across sectors and geographies to mitigate risks.

Active management allows OTPPB to capitalize on market inefficiencies and generate alpha.

# Ordinary Income

In the realm of [finance](../f/finance.md) and [taxation](../t/taxation.md), "ordinary [income](../i/income.md)" refers to any [earnings](../e/earnings.md) that are generated from standard [business](../b/business.md) operations, investments, and other sources that are subject to regular [income tax](../i/income_tax.md) rates. Ordinary [income](../i/income.md) can encompass a wide [range](../r/range.md) of [income](../i/income.md) types including wages, salaries, tips, bonuses, commissions, [interest](../i/interest.md), dividends, [business](../b/business.md) [income](../i/income.md), and rental [income](../i/income.md). The characterization of [income](../i/income.md) as "ordinary" carries significant implications for personal and [business](../b/business.md) finances, influencing [taxation](../t/taxation.md), investment decisions, and [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md).

## Sources of Ordinary Income

### Salaries and Wages

The most common sources of ordinary [income](../i/income.md) originate from employment. Salaries and wages are typically considered ordinary [income](../i/income.md) and are subject to the progressive [income tax](../i/income_tax.md) rates imposed by governmental tax authorities. This category also includes:

- **Tips and Bonuses:** Additional compensation received for services rendered.
- **Commissions:** [Earnings](../e/earnings.md) based on sales performance or transactions completed.
- **Overtime Pay:** Extra pay received for working beyond the standard hours.

### Business Income

For individuals who are self-employed or who own businesses, ordinary [income](../i/income.md) can include the [earnings](../e/earnings.md) derived from [business](../b/business.md) operations. This is assessed after deducting allowable [business](../b/business.md) expenses such as costs of goods sold, employee salaries, and other operating expenditures.

### Interest and Dividends

[Interest](../i/interest.md) [income](../i/income.md) from savings accounts, CDs (Certificates of [Deposit](../d/deposit.md)), bonds, and other [interest](../i/interest.md)-bearing instruments is considered ordinary [income](../i/income.md). Likewise, dividends received from stock investments may also be classified as ordinary [income](../i/income.md), although qualified dividends might be taxed at a lower rate depending on tax regulations.

### Rental Income

[Income](../i/income.md) earned from renting out property is also categorized as ordinary [income](../i/income.md). Landlords can deduct certain expenses related to property maintenance, but the net [revenue](../r/revenue.md) is taxed at regular [income tax](../i/income_tax.md) rates.

### Royalties and Licenses

[Earnings](../e/earnings.md) from intellectual properties such as patents, trademarks, copyrights, and mineral rights are considered ordinary [income](../i/income.md). These could include payments received for the use of inventions, literary works, or natural resources.

### Social Security and Pensions

For retirees, [social security](../s/social_security.md) benefits and pension [income](../i/income.md) can qualify as ordinary [income](../i/income.md). However, the tax treatment of these sources can differ based on a variety of factors such as the total [income](../i/income.md) level and specific tax laws.

### Alimony and Unemployment Benefits

- **Alimony:** Payments received from an ex-spouse as part of a divorce settlement were previously classified as ordinary [income](../i/income.md). However, under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017, alimony for divorces finalized after December 31, 2018, is no longer considered [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md).
- **[Unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) Benefits:** These are considered ordinary [income](../i/income.md) and are taxed similarly to other sources.

## Taxation of Ordinary Income

### Progressive Tax Rates

Ordinary [income](../i/income.md) is generally subject to [progressive tax](../p/progressive_tax.md) rates, which means the [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md) increases as the amount of [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md) increases. This [taxation](../t/taxation.md) system is designed to ensure that higher-[income](../i/income.md) earners contribute a larger fraction of their [income](../i/income.md) compared to lower-[income](../i/income.md) earners. Various [tax brackets](../t/tax_brackets.md) exist, and they can vary significantly from one country to another.

### Tax Deductions and Credits

To mitigate the tax burden, individuals and businesses can take advantage of various deductions and credits:

- **Deductions** lower the amount of [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md). Common deductions include [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [interest](../i/interest.md), charitable contributions, and certain medical expenses.
- **Tax Credits** provide a direct reduction to the tax owed. These could include credits for education expenses, energy-efficient [home](../h/home.md) improvements, and child dependent care.

### Self-Employment Taxes

For self-employed individuals, ordinary [income](../i/income.md) is subject to [self-employment](../s/self-employment.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md), which cover [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) and Medicare [taxes](../t/taxes.md) that would typically be withheld from an employee's pay by an employer. The [self-employment](../s/self-employment.md) rate can be higher, but half of the [self-employment](../s/self-employment.md) tax can be deducted to reduce [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md).

## Planning for Ordinary Income

Effective [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md) for ordinary [income](../i/income.md) involves several strategies to optimize tax [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and maintain [financial health](../f/financial_health.md):

### Income Smoothing

[Income smoothing](../i/income_smoothing.md) involves spreading [income](../i/income.md) and expenses as evenly as possible over a period to avoid large fluctuations. This can help manage tax liabilities and ensure a more stable financial state.

### Investment Diversification

Diversifying investments across various [asset](../a/asset.md) classes can help manage [risk](../r/risk.md) and provide [multiple](../m/multiple.md) streams of [income](../i/income.md), potentially optimizing tax treatments. Investments in [tax-advantaged](../t/tax-advantaged.md) accounts like IRAs or 401(k)s can also provide significant advantages.

### Retirement Planning

Contributing to retirement accounts like 401(k)s, IRAs, and other pension plans can reduce [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md). Additionally, understanding the tax implications of withdrawals during retirement is crucial for minimizing tax liabilities.

### Tax-Advantaged Accounts

Utilizing Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs), and other [tax-advantaged](../t/tax-advantaged.md) accounts can help reduce [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md) while covering necessary expenses like medical costs and dependent care.

### Professional Guidance

Given the complexity of tax laws and the myriad of potential sources of ordinary [income](../i/income.md), consulting with tax professionals and financial advisors can provide tailored strategies that align with personal financial goals and circumstances.

## Conclusion

Ordinary [income](../i/income.md) forms a fundamental component of financial life, influencing [taxation](../t/taxation.md), investment strategies, and long-term [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md). Understanding its various sources and the implications of its [taxation](../t/taxation.md) can equip individuals and businesses to better manage their finances and optimize their tax liabilities. Strategies like [income smoothing](../i/income_smoothing.md), investment [diversification](../d/diversification.md), [retirement planning](../r/retirement_planning.md), and professional consultation are crucial for effectively navigating the landscape of ordinary [income](../i/income.md) and achieving financial stability.

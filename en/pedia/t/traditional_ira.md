# Traditional IRA

A Traditional Individual Retirement Account (IRA) is a type of retirement [savings account](../s/savings_account.md) that provides investors with tax benefits. This vehicle was first introduced in the United States by the Employee Retirement [Income](../i/income.md) [Security](../s/security.md) Act of 1974 (ERISA) in [order](../o/order.md) to encourage people to save for retirement. Traditional IRAs are among the most popular retirement saving mechanisms for individuals, thanks to their tax advantages and the flexibility they [offer](../o/offer.md).

## Basics of Traditional IRA

### Tax-Deductible Contributions

Contributions to a Traditional IRA can be deducted from your [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md), so long as you meet certain criteria. This feature is one of the primary benefits of a Traditional IRA. For example, if you earn $75,000 annually and contribute $5,000 to a Traditional IRA, your [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md) for the year [will](../w/will.md) be reduced to $70,000, potentially placing you in a lower tax bracket and resulting in significant tax savings.

### Tax-Deferred Growth

The [earnings](../e/earnings.md) within a Traditional IRA grow [tax-deferred](../t/tax_deferred.md), meaning you [will](../w/will.md) not owe [taxes](../t/taxes.md) on the [income](../i/income.md), dividends, or [capital](../c/capital.md) gains generated by the investments in your IRA until you begin taking distributions in retirement. This allows your investments to compound more quickly than they would in a taxable account.

### Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)

Once you reach the age of 72, you are required to begin taking Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) from your Traditional IRA. The amount of your RMD is based on your [account balance](../a/account_balance.md) and [life expectancy](../l/life_expectancy.md). Failure to take the required distributions can result in significant penalties.

### Contribution Limits

There are annual contribution limits for Traditional IRAs. For the tax year 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you are age 50 or older, thanks to the "catch-up" [provision](../p/provision.md).

### Income Limits

Although anyone with [earned income](../e/earned_income.md) can contribute to a Traditional IRA, the tax deductibility of your contributions may be limited if you or your spouse is covered by an employer-sponsored retirement plan and your [income](../i/income.md) exceeds certain thresholds. For example, in 2023, if you are covered by a retirement plan at work, the [deduction](../d/deduction.md) phases out between $68,000 and $78,000 for single filers, and between $109,000 and $129,000 for married couples filing jointly.

## Investment Opportunities

Traditional IRAs [offer](../o/offer.md) a wide [range](../r/range.md) of investment [options](../o/options.md), including:

### Stocks

[Stocks](../s/stock.md) represent [shares](../s/shares.md) of ownership in a company. They [offer](../o/offer.md) the potential for significant growth over the long term, making them a popular choice for IRA investments, especially for younger investors with a longer [time horizon](../t/time_horizon.md) until retirement.

### Bonds

Bonds are [debt](../d/debt.md) securities issued by corporations, municipalities, or the federal government. They provide regular [interest](../i/interest.md) payments and are generally considered to be less risky than [stocks](../s/stock.md), making them an attractive option for more conservative investors or those closer to retirement.

### Mutual Funds

Mutual funds pool [money](../m/money.md) from many investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, or other securities. They [offer](../o/offer.md) instant [diversification](../d/diversification.md) and professional management, making them a popular choice for IRA investors.

### Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)

ETFs are similar to mutual funds but [trade](../t/trade.md) on stock exchanges like individual [stocks](../s/stock.md). They [offer](../o/offer.md) the benefits of [diversification](../d/diversification.md) and professional management, often with lower fees than mutual funds.

### Certificates of Deposit (CDs)

CDs are low-[risk](../r/risk.md), [interest](../i/interest.md)-earning savings products with fixed terms and [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. They are backed by the [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) of the issuing [bank](../b/bank.md) and are insured by the Federal [Deposit](../d/deposit.md) [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) (FDIC) up to certain limits.

### Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)

REITs are companies that own, operate, or [finance](../f/finance.md) [income](../i/income.md)-producing [real estate](../r/real_estate.md). They provide investors with exposure to the [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) [market](../m/market.md) without the need to own and manage physical properties.

### Precious Metals

Some IRAs provide the option to invest in physical gold, silver, [platinum](../p/platinum.md), and palladium, [offering](../o/offering.md) a [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against [inflation](../i/inflation.md) and economic [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md).

## Rolling Over

If you change jobs or retire, you may want to roll over your retirement savings from an employer-sponsored plan, such as a 401(k), into a Traditional IRA. A [rollover](../r/rollover.md) can provide more investment [options](../o/options.md) and potentially lower fees. It is important to complete the [rollover](../r/rollover.md) process correctly to avoid [taxes](../t/taxes.md) and penalties. Direct rollovers, where funds are transferred directly from one financial institution to another, are generally the best option.

## Withdrawal Rules

### Early Withdrawals

Withdrawals from a Traditional IRA before the age of 59½ are typically subject to a 10% early [withdrawal penalty](../w/withdrawal_penalty.md), in addition to regular [income](../i/income.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md). However, there are exceptions to this rule for certain situations, such as:

- First-time homebuyer expenses (up to $10,000)
- Qualified higher education expenses
- Unreimbursed medical expenses exceeding 10% of adjusted [gross income](../g/gross_income.md)
- [Health insurance](../h/health_insurance.md) premiums while unemployed
- Substantially equal periodic payments (SEPPs)
- Disability or death

### Qualified Distributions

After reaching the age of 59½, you can take qualified distributions from your Traditional IRA without penalty. These distributions [will](../w/will.md) still be subject to regular [income tax](../i/income_tax.md).

## Estate Planning

Traditional IRAs can also play a significant role in [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md). Upon your death, the assets in your IRA [will](../w/will.md) pass to your designated beneficiaries. These beneficiaries [will](../w/will.md) be required to take distributions according to IRS rules, but they may have the option to stretch these distributions over their lifetime, potentially minimizing the tax impact.

## Traditional IRA vs. Roth IRA

When considering an IRA, it's important to understand the differences between a Traditional IRA and a [Roth IRA](../r/roth_ira.md). The main differences lie in the timing of the tax benefits and the rules for taking distributions:

### Traditional IRA

- Contributions are tax-deductible (subject to [income](../i/income.md) limits and other criteria).
- [Earnings](../e/earnings.md) grow [tax-deferred](../t/tax_deferred.md).
- Distributions in retirement are taxed as [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md).
- Required minimum distributions begin at age 72.

### Roth IRA

- Contributions are made with after-tax dollars and are not tax-deductible.
- [Earnings](../e/earnings.md) grow [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md).
- Qualified distributions in retirement are [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md).
- No required minimum distributions during the account owner's lifetime.

### Choosing Between Traditional and Roth IRA

The choice between a Traditional IRA and a [Roth IRA](../r/roth_ira.md) depends on your individual circumstances, including your current tax bracket, expected tax bracket in retirement, and retirement savings goals. A [financial advisor](../f/financial_advisor.md) can help you determine which type of IRA is best suited to your needs.

## Financial Institutions Offering Traditional IRAs

There are many financial institutions that [offer](../o/offer.md) Traditional IRAs, including banks, brokerage firms, [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md) companies, and [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies. When choosing a provider, consider factors such as fees, investment [options](../o/options.md), [customer service](../c/customer_service.md), and overall reputation. Some of the well-known institutions that [offer](../o/offer.md) Traditional IRAs include:

- [Fidelity](https://www.fidelity.com/retirement-ira/traditional-ira)

- [E*TRADE](https://us.etrade.com/what-we-offer/our-accounts/ira/traditional-ira)

## Advantages of Traditional IRA

### Tax Benefits

The primary advantage of a Traditional IRA is the opportunity to make tax-deductible contributions, reducing your [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md) for the year. Additionally, the [tax-deferred](../t/tax_deferred.md) growth of [earnings](../e/earnings.md) allows your investments to compound more quickly.

### Flexibility

Traditional IRAs [offer](../o/offer.md) a wide [range](../r/range.md) of investment [options](../o/options.md), allowing you to tailor your portfolio to match your [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md), investment goals, and [time horizon](../t/time_horizon.md).

### Estate Planning

Traditional IRAs can be a valuable tool for [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md), allowing you to pass on assets to your beneficiaries while potentially minimizing tax implications.

## Disadvantages of Traditional IRA

### Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)

The requirement to take minimum distributions beginning at age 72 can be a disadvantage for those who do not need the [income](../i/income.md) and would prefer to let their assets continue to grow [tax-deferred](../t/tax_deferred.md).

### Early Withdrawal Penalties

Withdrawals before the age of 59½ are subject to a 10% penalty, which can be a significant deterrent for those who may need access to their funds in case of emergencies.

### Contribution Limits

Annual contribution limits may be lower than what some individuals would like to save for retirement, especially if they are starting later in life and have a limited number of years to build their [nest egg](../n/nest_egg.md).

### Income Limits for Deductibility

For individuals covered by an employer-sponsored retirement plan, the ability to deduct contributions may be limited based on [income](../i/income.md), reducing the attractiveness of a Traditional IRA for higher-[income](../i/income.md) earners.

## Conclusion

A Traditional IRA can be a highly effective tool for retirement savings, [offering](../o/offering.md) significant tax advantages, a wide [range](../r/range.md) of investment [options](../o/options.md), and flexibility in planning for the future. However, it's important to understand the rules and limitations, including contribution limits, deductibility criteria, and required minimum distributions. By carefully considering your individual circumstances and retirement goals, and possibly consulting with a [financial advisor](../f/financial_advisor.md), you can determine whether a Traditional IRA is the right choice for your [retirement planning](../r/retirement_planning.md) needs.

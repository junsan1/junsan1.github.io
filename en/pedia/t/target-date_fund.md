# Target-Date Fund

A target-date [fund](../f/fund.md) is a type of [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md) designed to simplify retirement [investing](../i/investing.md) by automatically adjusting the [asset](../a/asset.md) mix according to a predetermined retirement date. Traditionally, these funds are structured to become more conservative as the target date approaches, reducing exposure to equities in favor of fixed-[income](../i/income.md) securities and other lower-[risk](../r/risk.md) investments. This evolution mirrors the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s shifting [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) and financial needs over time.

## Understanding Target-Date Funds

### Structure and Composition

Target-date funds are typically composed of a mix of [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, and other types of investments. The specific mix is determined by the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s target date, which is usually stated in the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s name. For example, a "2030 Target-Date [Fund](../f/fund.md)" implies that the [investor](../i/investor.md) plans to retire around the year 2030. The idea is that, as the retirement date approaches, the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s allocation becomes more conservative, with a heavier weighting toward bonds and other fixed-[income](../i/income.md) investments.

### Glide Path

The transition in [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) over time follows a predefined "[glide path](../g/glide_path.md)." The [glide path](../g/glide_path.md) starts with a higher allocation to equities ([stocks](../s/stock.md)) when the target date is far away. This higher allocation seeks to provide growth potential by taking advantage of the longer [time horizon](../t/time_horizon.md). As the target date draws nearer, the allocation steadily shifts toward more conservative investments like bonds to reduce [risk](../r/risk.md). 

### Lifecycle of Investment

1. **[Accumulation Phase](../a/accumulation_phase.md)**: In the early years, the [fund](../f/fund.md) [will](../w/will.md) have a higher proportion of equities to maximize growth potential.
2. **Transition Phase**: As the target date approaches, the [fund](../f/fund.md) [will](../w/will.md) gradually reduce its [equity](../e/equity.md) exposure, shifting towards bonds and other fixed-[income](../i/income.md) securities.
3. **[Distribution](../d/distribution.md) Phase**: At and after the target date, the [fund](../f/fund.md) [will](../w/will.md) [hold](../h/hold.md) a conservative allocation designed to preserve [capital](../c/capital.md) and generate [income](../i/income.md).

## Risk Tolerance in Target-Date Funds

### Early Years: Higher Risk Tolerance

Investors at the beginning of their retirement savings journey usually have a higher [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) since they have more time to ride out [market](../m/market.md) fluctuations. During this period, the target-date [fund](../f/fund.md) [will](../w/will.md) have a substantial allocation to equities, which, although riskier, [offer](../o/offer.md) higher potential returns.

### Approaching Retirement: Lower Risk Tolerance

As the target date approaches, the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) typically decreases because the [investment horizon](../i/investment_horizon.md) shortens, and the focus shifts from growth to [preservation of capital](../p/preservation_of_capital.md). The [fund](../f/fund.md) gradually lowers the [equity](../e/equity.md) exposure and increases the proportion of bonds and other low-[risk](../r/risk.md) investments.

### Post-Retirement: Sustaining Low Risk

After reaching the target retirement date, the [fund](../f/fund.md) continues to manage [risk](../r/risk.md) by maintaining a conservative portfolio. This ensures that the [capital](../c/capital.md) is protected and there is a steady [income](../i/income.md) stream for the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s retirement years.

## Example of a Target-Date Fund

Consider the Fidelity Freedom 2030 [Fund](../f/fund.md) (Ticker: FFFEX) as an example:

- **Initial Allocation**: 
  - Equities: 90%
  - Bonds: 10%
  - Others (e.g., cash, [real estate](../r/real_estate.md)): 0%
  
- **10 Years Before Target Date**:
  - Equities: 70%
  - Bonds: 25%
  - Others: 5%
  
- **At Target Date**:
  - Equities: 50%
  - Bonds: 45%
  - Others: 5%

- **10 Years After Target Date**:
  - Equities: 30%
  - Bonds: 65%
  - Others: 5%

This gradual shift in allocation represents a decreasing [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) as the target retirement date approaches and eventually is designed to preserve [capital](../c/capital.md) and provide steady [income](../i/income.md) post-retirement.

## Conclusion

Target-date funds [offer](../o/offer.md) a simplified approach to retirement [investing](../i/investing.md) by automatically adjusting the [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) to match the [investor](../i/investor.md)â€™s changing [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) over their lifecycle. These funds are designed to be a "set it and forget it" option, allowing investors to benefit from professional management and strategic [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) shifts without needing to rebalance their portfolios manually. However, it is crucial for investors to regularly review their [fund](../f/fund.md)'s [glide path](../g/glide_path.md) and performance to ensure it aligns with their individual retirement goals and [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md).

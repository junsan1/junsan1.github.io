# Tax Fraud

Tax [fraud](../f/fraud.md) is a form of financial crime that involves the illegal evasion of [taxes](../t/taxes.md) by individuals, businesses, or corporations. It is a deliberate attempt to falsify information on tax returns to lower the [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md) or to claim refunds that are not legally entitled. Tax [fraud](../f/fraud.md) undermines the integrity of the tax system and manipulates governmental [revenue](../r/revenue.md) which is essential for public services.

## Types of Tax Fraud
Tax [fraud](../f/fraud.md) can occur in various forms, some of which include:

### 1. Underreporting Income
This involves not reporting all the [income](../i/income.md) earned to reduce the amount of tax owed. This form of tax [fraud](../f/fraud.md) is prevalent among self-employed individuals, businesses dealing in cash, and those who earn tips or informal [income](../i/income.md).

### 2. Overstating Deductions and Expenses
Taxpayers may exaggerate the amount of deductions or [business](../b/business.md) expenses to lower their [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md). For instance, inflating charitable donations, claiming personal expenses as [business](../b/business.md) expenses, or declaring false dependents.

### 3. Claiming Non-Existent Dependents
Individuals might list fictitious dependents such as nonexistent children or relatives to benefit from tax credits and exemptions. This type of [fraud](../f/fraud.md) is popular because it is hard for tax authorities to verify the existence of claimed dependents.

### 4. False Tax Returns
Filing false tax returns is a blatant form of [fraud](../f/fraud.md) where an individual or [business](../b/business.md) provides false information or documents to support deductions, credits, or rebates.

### 5. Offshore Tax Evasion
This type of tax [fraud](../f/fraud.md) involves hiding [income](../i/income.md) or assets in [offshore](../o/offshore.md) accounts to evade [taxes](../t/taxes.md). Individuals or corporations may use shell companies, anonymous accounts, and foreign trusts to conceal [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md).

### 6. Identity Theft Tax Fraud
Criminals steal personal information to file fraudulent tax returns and claim refunds before the legitimate [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) files their [return](../r/return.md). This has become an increasingly common form of tax [fraud](../f/fraud.md) with the proliferation of digital services.

## Consequences of Tax Fraud
The consequences of tax [fraud](../f/fraud.md) can be severe and include:

### 1. Legal Penalties
Individuals or companies found guilty of tax [fraud](../f/fraud.md) can face substantial legal penalties, including fines ranging from a few thousand to millions of dollars, and incarceration for those directly involved.

### 2. Reputational Damage

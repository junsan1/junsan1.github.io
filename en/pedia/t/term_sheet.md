# Term Sheet

A term sheet is a critical document in the world of [finance](../f/finance.md) and [business](../b/business.md), acting as a non-binding agreement that outlines the basic terms and conditions under which an investment [will](../w/will.md) be made. It serves as a foundation for future legal documents and provides a clear and concise outline of the deal structure, paving the way for the drafting of more detailed and legally binding agreements such as a [Shareholders' Agreement](../s/shareholders'_agreement.md) or Investment Agreement.

- Ensure board representation and control over major decisions.

### For Entrepreneurs

- Negotiate favorable terms for stock [vesting](../v/vesting.md) and [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payouts.

## Risks and Challenges

### Non-Binding Nature
The non-binding nature of term sheets means that either party can withdraw from the deal, which introduces a level of [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md).

### Complexity
Especially in [venture capital](../v/venture_capital.md) deals, the complexity of terms can make it challenging for entrepreneurs to fully understand and negotiate effectively without legal assistance.

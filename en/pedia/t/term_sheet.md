# Term Sheet

A term sheet is a critical document in the world of finance and business, acting as a non-binding agreement that outlines the basic terms and conditions under which an investment will be made. It serves as a foundation for future legal documents and provides a clear and concise outline of the deal structure, paving the way for the drafting of more detailed and legally binding agreements such as a Shareholders' Agreement or Investment Agreement.

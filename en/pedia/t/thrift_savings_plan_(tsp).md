# Thrift Savings Plan (TSP)

The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) is a retirement savings and investment plan for federal employees and members of the uniformed services, including the Ready Reserve. It was established by Congress in the Federal Employees Retirement System Act of 1986 and provides participants with a way to save for retirement while potentially enjoying tax benefits similar to those in private-sector 401(k) plans.

## Overview of TSP

The TSP is designed to [offer](../o/offer.md) federal employees the opportunity to contribute to their retirement savings through several investment [options](../o/options.md). The main features of TSP include:

- **Contribution [Options](../o/options.md):** Federal employees can contribute a portion of their salary to the TSP, either on a pre-tax [basis](../b/basis.md) (Traditional contributions) or on a post-tax [basis](../b/basis.md) (Roth contributions). Some [federal agencies](../f/federal_agencies.md) also [offer](../o/offer.md) matching contributions up to a certain limit.
- **Investment Choices:** TSP offers five individual funds that invest in different types of assets and are designed to provide participants with a diversified [range](../r/range.md) of investment [options](../o/options.md).
- **[Loan](../l/loan.md) [Options](../o/options.md):** Participants can borrow from their TSP accounts under specific conditions.
- **Transfer and [Withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) [Options](../o/options.md):** Participants have various [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) [options](../o/options.md) upon reaching retirement age, whereas funds can also be transferred to other qualifying retirement accounts.

## TSP Investment Funds

The TSP offers five core investment funds, each designed with specific [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md) characteristics. These include:

- **G [Fund](../f/fund.md) (Government Securities [Investment Fund](../i/investment_fund.md)):** This [fund](../f/fund.md) invests in short-term [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) securities and aims to provide a [rate of return](../r/rate_of_return.md) higher than [inflation](../i/inflation.md) without exposing participants to any [risk](../r/risk.md) of loss.
- **F [Fund](../f/fund.md) ([Fixed Income](../f/fixed_income.md) [Investment Fund](../i/investment_fund.md)):** The F [Fund](../f/fund.md) is invested in a broad [range](../r/range.md) of fixed-[income](../i/income.md) securities representing the U.S. [bond market](../b/bond_market.md).
- **C [Fund](../f/fund.md) ([Common Stock](../c/common_stock.md) [Index](../i/index.md) [Investment Fund](../i/investment_fund.md)):** The C [Fund](../f/fund.md) tracks the S&P 500 [Index](../i/index.md), [offering](../o/offering.md) exposure to large-cap U.S. equities.
- **S [Fund](../f/fund.md) (Small [Capitalization](../c/capitalization.md) Stock [Index](../i/index.md) [Investment Fund](../i/investment_fund.md)):** The S [Fund](../f/fund.md) follows the Dow Jones U.S. Completion TSM [Index](../i/index.md), which includes U.S. [stocks](../s/stock.md) not found in the C [Fund](../f/fund.md), mainly small- and [mid-cap stocks](../m/mid-cap_stocks.md).
- **I [Fund](../f/fund.md) (International Stock [Index](../i/index.md) [Investment Fund](../i/investment_fund.md)):** This [fund](../f/fund.md) mirrors the performance of the MSCI [EAFE Index](../e/eafe_index.md), giving participants exposure to international [stocks](../s/stock.md) in developed markets outside of North America.

In addition to these five funds, TSP also offers Lifecycle (L) Funds, which are target-date funds designed to automatically adjust the [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) mix based on the participant's expected retirement date.

## Managing TSP Accounts

Participants can manage their TSP accounts through various online tools and services available on the TSP website. These tools include:

- **Account Access:** Participants can view their [account balance](../a/account_balance.md), request [fund](../f/fund.md) reallocations, and track their investment performance.
- **Contribution Management:** Participants can adjust their contribution amounts and allocate contributions to different TSP funds.
- **[Loan](../l/loan.md) Processing:** The TSP allows participants to apply for loans and manage [loan](../l/loan.md) repayments directly through their online accounts.

## Tax Implications

TSP offers [tax-advantaged](../t/tax-advantaged.md) retirement savings [options](../o/options.md), and participants can choose between Traditional and Roth contributions:

- **Traditional Contributions:** Contributions are made pre-tax, meaning they reduce a participant's [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md) in the year they are made. Investment [earnings](../e/earnings.md) grow [tax-deferred](../t/tax_deferred.md), and participants pay [taxes](../t/taxes.md) on contributions and [earnings](../e/earnings.md) upon [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md).
- **Roth Contributions:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, meaning no immediate [tax benefit](../t/tax_benefit.md) is received. However, qualified withdrawals, including [earnings](../e/earnings.md), are [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md) if certain conditions are met, such as the participant being at least 59Â½ years old and having held the account for at least five years.

## Retirement and Beyond

Upon reaching retirement age, TSP participants can choose from several [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) [options](../o/options.md):

- **Single [Payment](../p/payment.md):** A one-time lump sum [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md).
- **Monthly Payments:** Systematic payments over a specified period or amount.
- **Annuity Purchase:** Converting the TSP balance into a stream of guaranteed monthly [income](../i/income.md) for life.

Participants also have the option to roll over their TSP balance into another retirement plan, such as an IRA, or leave their funds in the TSP to continue benefiting from low-cost investment [options](../o/options.md) and potential growth.

## Conclusion

The Thrift Savings Plan provides federal employees and members of the uniformed services with a valuable tool for retirement savings. By [offering](../o/offering.md) a [range](../r/range.md) of investment [options](../o/options.md), tax advantages, and flexible contribution and [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) choices, the TSP supports participants in building a secure financial future.

# Triple Top

The Triple Top is a type of chart pattern used in [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). It is characterized by three peaks at roughly the same [price level](../p/price_level.md) and is typically seen as a [reversal](../r/reversal.md) pattern, indicating a possible change in [trend](../t/trend.md) direction. Traders and analysts consider this pattern as a bearish signal, representing the exhaustion of an upward [trend](../t/trend.md) and the potential for a downward movement in prices.

### Formation of the Triple Top Pattern

The [Triple Top pattern](../t/triple_top_patterns.md) forms after an extended [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md) and is marked by the following characteristics:
1. **Three Peaks**: The price reaches a high point on three separate occasions, all roughly around the same [price level](../p/price_level.md). These peaks are typically separated by some degree of price declines.
2. **Intervening Troughs**: Between the peaks, there are two noticeable troughs or valleys where the price declines before climbing back up to the peak level.
3. **[Volume Patterns](../v/volume_patterns.md)**: [Volume](../v/volume.md) often diminishes with each successive peak, indicating weakening [momentum](../m/momentum.md) in the price movement.
4. **Breakdown Point**: The pattern is confirmed when the price breaks below the support level established by the two intervening troughs. This breakdown point is a critical signal for traders to act upon.

### Phases of the Triple Top Pattern

1. **First Peak**:
    - The price is in an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md) and reaches a new high before undergoing a [correction](../c/correction.md), leading to a decline.
    - This peak helps in establishing a resistance level, which is the first high in the formation.

2. **First [Trough](../t/trough.md)**:
    - After the first peak, the price declines to form the first [trough](../t/trough.md). This [trough](../t/trough.md) acts as a minor support level.
    - The depth of this [trough](../t/trough.md) can vary but generally does not go below significant previous [support levels](../s/support_levels.md).

3. **Second Peak**:
    - The price rises again, attempting to reach new highs but only manages to climb to a level near the first peak.
    - This second peak reinforces the resistance level established by the first peak.

4. **Second [Trough](../t/trough.md)**:
    - The price drops again, forming a second [trough](../t/trough.md) that is usually around the same level as the first [trough](../t/trough.md).
    - The consistency of the [trough](../t/trough.md) levels highlights the potential formation of the pattern.

5. **Third Peak**:
    - The price makes one final attempt to break above the resistance level but fails, reaching a third peak near the previous two.
    - Once this peak is formed, the [triple top pattern](../t/triple_top_patterns.md) is largely in place, signaling a potential bearish [trend](../t/trend.md).

6. **Breakdown**:
    - Confirmation of the [triple top pattern](../t/triple_top_patterns.md) occurs when the price breaks below the support level formed by the two troughs.
    - Increased trading [volume](../v/volume.md) often accompanies this breakdown, adding further validation to the signal.

### Example of a Triple Top Pattern

Consider the hypothetical case where a stock (Stock XYZ) is in an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md), trading at the following sequence of prices over six months:
- Peak 1: $50
- [Trough](../t/trough.md) 1: $45
- Peak 2: $50
- [Trough](../t/trough.md) 2: $45
- Peak 3: $49
- Breakdown: $44

In this scenario, the peaks at $50 and $49 form the resistance level, and the troughs at $45 establish the support level. When the price finally breaks down to $44, it confirms the [triple top pattern](../t/triple_top_patterns.md), signaling a potential bearish [trend](../t/trend.md) to traders.

### Trading Strategy Using Triple Top Pattern

1. **Entry Point**:
    - Traders often wait for the price to break below the support level (confirmation) before entering a short position.
    - Some aggressive traders may enter a short position after the formation of the third peak, anticipating the breakdown.

2. **Stop-Loss Placement**:
    - A common stop-loss level is set above the third peak to limit potential losses if the pattern fails.
    - This stop-loss ensures that the [trader](../t/trader.md) exits the position if the price unexpectedly breaks above the established resistance level.

3. **[Profit](../p/profit.md) Targets**:
    - Traders usually set [profit](../p/profit.md) targets based on the height of the [triple top pattern](../t/triple_top_patterns.md). The vertical distance between the peaks and the support level can be projected downward from the breakdown point to estimate the potential price decline.
    - Example: If the peaks are at $50 and the support is at $45, the height is $5. Subtracting $5 from the breakdown point ($44) gives a target price of $39.

### Limitations and Considerations

While the [Triple Top pattern](../t/triple_top_patterns.md) is a useful tool in [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md), it is not foolproof. Traders should consider the following limitations and apply additional analysis for confirmation:
1. **False Breakdowns**: In some cases, the price might break below the support level temporarily and then reverse, invalidating the pattern.
2. **[Market](../m/market.md) Conditions**: The effectiveness of the [triple top pattern](../t/triple_top_patterns.md) can vary based on overall [market](../m/market.md) conditions, economic factors, and news events.
3. **[Volume Confirmation](../v/volume_confirmation.md)**: The breakdown with increasing [volume](../v/volume.md) adds reliability to the pattern. Conversely, a lack of [volume](../v/volume.md) can indicate a false signal.
4. **Different Time Frames**: Triple tops can appear on various time frames from daily charts to intraday charts. Traders should analyze [multiple](../m/multiple.md) time frames to confirm the pattern's validity.

### Conclusion

The [Triple Top pattern](../t/triple_top_patterns.md) is a significant [indicator](../i/indicator.md) for identifying potential bearish reversals in price trends. By understanding its formation, traders can effectively use it to make informed trading decisions. However, it is essential to combine the pattern with other [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) and [market](../m/market.md) analysis to mitigate risks and increase the probability of successful trades.

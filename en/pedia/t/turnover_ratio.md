# Turnover Ratio

[Turnover](../t/turnover.md) Ratio is a financial metric used to evaluate the effectiveness of a company's operations, particularly its ability to manage assets and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) in generating sales. It can also be applied to investment portfolios to measure the buying and selling activity of assets. The [turnover](../t/turnover.md) ratio serves as an [indicator](../i/indicator.md) for various aspects of a company’s or portfolio's performance, including [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), management quality, and [operational efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md).

## Types of Turnover Ratios

[Turnover ratios](../t/turnover_ratios.md) can be categorized into several types, each focusing on different aspects of the company's operations:

1. **[Inventory Turnover](../i/inventory_turnover.md) Ratio**: Measures how efficiently [inventory](../i/inventory.md) is managed.
2. **[Receivables Turnover Ratio](../r/receivables_turnover_ratio.md)**: Gauges how effectively a [firm](../f/firm.md) collects its receivables.
3. **[Asset Turnover Ratio](../a/asset_turnover_ratio.md)**: Evaluates how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.
4. **[Portfolio Turnover](../p/portfolio_turnover.md) Ratio**: Assesses the activity of buying and selling within an investment portfolio.

### Inventory Turnover Ratio

**Definition**: [Inventory Turnover](../i/inventory_turnover.md) Ratio is the number of times a company’s [inventory](../i/inventory.md) is sold and replaced over a specific period.

**Formula**: 
\[
\text{[Inventory Turnover](../i/inventory_turnover.md) Ratio} = \frac{\text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}}{\text{[Average Inventory](../a/average_inventory.md)}}
\]

**Interpretation**: A higher [inventory turnover](../i/inventory_turnover.md) ratio indicates efficient management of [inventory](../i/inventory.md), as it reflects faster movement of stock. Conversely, a lower ratio suggests overstocking or inefficiency in selling goods.

**Example**: If Company A has a COGS of $2,000,000 and an [average inventory](../a/average_inventory.md) of $500,000, the [inventory turnover](../i/inventory_turnover.md) ratio would be:
\[
\text{[Inventory Turnover](../i/inventory_turnover.md) Ratio} = \frac{2,000,000}{500,000} = 4
\]
This means the company sells and replaces its [inventory](../i/inventory.md) four times a year.

### Receivables Turnover Ratio

**Definition**: The [Receivables Turnover Ratio](../r/receivables_turnover_ratio.md) measures how effectively a company collects on its accounts [receivable](../r/receivable.md).

**Formula**: 
\[
\text{[Receivables Turnover Ratio](../r/receivables_turnover_ratio.md)} = \frac{\text{Net [Credit](../c/credit.md) Sales}}{\text{Average Accounts [Receivable](../r/receivable.md)}}
\]

**Interpretation**: A higher [receivables turnover ratio](../r/receivables_turnover_ratio.md) indicates that the company is efficient in collecting its receivables. A lower ratio might suggest issues with [credit](../c/credit.md) policies or [customer](../c/customer.md) [payment](../p/payment.md) delays.

**Example**: If Company B has net [credit](../c/credit.md) sales of $1,500,000 and an average accounts [receivable](../r/receivable.md) of $300,000, the [receivables turnover ratio](../r/receivables_turnover_ratio.md) would be:
\[
\text{[Receivables Turnover Ratio](../r/receivables_turnover_ratio.md)} = \frac{1,500,000}{300,000} = 5
\]
This indicates the company collects its average receivables five times a year.

### Asset Turnover Ratio

**Definition**: [Asset Turnover Ratio](../a/asset_turnover_ratio.md) indicates how well a company uses its assets to generate sales.

**Formula**: 
\[
\text{[Asset Turnover Ratio](../a/asset_turnover_ratio.md)} = \frac{\text{[Net Sales](../n/net_sales.md)}}{\text{Average Total Assets}}
\]

**Interpretation**: A higher [asset turnover ratio](../a/asset_turnover_ratio.md) implies that the company is efficiently using its assets to produce sales. A lower ratio might suggest underutilization of assets.

**Example**: If Company C has [net sales](../n/net_sales.md) of $4,000,000 and average total assets of $2,000,000, the [asset turnover ratio](../a/asset_turnover_ratio.md) would be:
\[
\text{[Asset Turnover Ratio](../a/asset_turnover_ratio.md)} = \frac{4,000,000}{2,000,000} = 2
\]
This means the company generates $2 in sales for every $1 of assets.

### Portfolio Turnover Ratio

**Definition**: [Portfolio Turnover](../p/portfolio_turnover.md) Ratio measures the rate at which assets within a portfolio are bought and sold by a [portfolio manager](../p/portfolio_manager.md).

**Formula**: 
\[
\text{[Portfolio Turnover](../p/portfolio_turnover.md) Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total amount of securities bought or sold}}{\text{Average total [asset](../a/asset.md) [value](../v/value.md)}}
\]

**Interpretation**: A high [portfolio turnover](../p/portfolio_turnover.md) ratio suggests a more active [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md), whereas a low ratio indicates a more passive strategy. It's essential to balance [turnover](../t/turnover.md) to minimize [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md) while procuring profitable opportunities.

**Example**: If a [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md) has total trades worth $1,200,000 and an average total [asset](../a/asset.md) [value](../v/value.md) of $3,000,000, the [portfolio turnover](../p/portfolio_turnover.md) ratio is:
\[
\text{[Portfolio Turnover](../p/portfolio_turnover.md) Ratio} = \frac{1,200,000}{3,000,000} = 0.4
\]
This implies that 40% of the [fund](../f/fund.md)’s assets are traded during the specified period.

## Importance of Turnover Ratios

[Turnover ratios](../t/turnover_ratios.md) are critical for various reasons:

1. **[Financial Health](../f/financial_health.md)**: They provide insights into the [operational efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md) and overall [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) of a [business](../b/business.md) or investment.
2. **Decision-Making**: Help managers make informed decisions about operations, [inventory management](../i/inventory_management.md), and investment strategies.
3. **[Comparative Analysis](../c/comparative_analysis.md)**: Facilitate comparisons between companies in the same [industry](../i/industry.md) to [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) performance.
4. **Investment Evaluation**: In the context of [portfolio management](../p/par.md), [turnover ratios](../t/turnover_ratios.md) can affect the performance and cost structure of funds, impacting [investor](../i/investor.md) returns.

## Case Study Examples

### Company Analysis: Inventory Turnover Ratio

**Company**: Walmart ([website](https://www.walmart.com))

Walmart, a retail giant, focuses heavily on efficient [inventory management](../i/inventory_management.md) to support its low-cost [business](../b/business.md) model. Let’s analyze Walmart’s [inventory turnover](../i/inventory_turnover.md) ratio:

- **Year**: 2022
- **COGS**: $400 billion (hypothetical)
- **[Average Inventory](../a/average_inventory.md)**: $40 billion (hypothetical)

**[Inventory Turnover](../i/inventory_turnover.md) Ratio**:
\[
\text{[Inventory Turnover](../i/inventory_turnover.md) Ratio} = \frac{400,000,000,000}{40,000,000,000} = 10
\]
A ratio of 10 signifies that Walmart sells and replenishes its [inventory](../i/inventory.md) 10 times a year, underscoring effective [inventory management](../i/inventory_management.md) essential for a retail operation of its scale.

### Investment Portfolio: Portfolio Turnover Ratio

**[Fund](../f/fund.md)**: Vanguard Total Stock [Market Index](../m/market_index.md) [Fund](../f/fund.md) ([website](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VTSAX))

Vanguard’s [fund](../f/fund.md) is known for its low-cost, passive [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md). Let’s consider its [turnover](../t/turnover.md) ratio:

- **Year**: 2022
- **Total Trades**: $10 billion (hypothetical)
- **Average Total [Asset](../a/asset.md) [Value](../v/value.md)**: $1 trillion (hypothetical)

**[Portfolio Turnover](../p/portfolio_turnover.md) Ratio**:
\[
\text{[Portfolio Turnover](../p/portfolio_turnover.md) Ratio} = \frac{10,000,000,000}{1,000,000,000,000} = 0.01
\]
This low ratio of 1% reflects Vanguard’s passive strategy, which prioritizes long-term holding over frequent trading, thereby minimizing [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md).

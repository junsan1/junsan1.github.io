# Tax Accounting

Tax [accounting](../a/accounting.md) is a [specialization](../s/specialization.md) within the field of [accounting](../a/accounting.md) that maintains a focus on the tax [obligations](../o/obligation.md) of individuals, businesses, and other entities. Unlike standard [accounting](../a/accounting.md), which aims to provide various stakeholders with a clear financial picture of an organization, tax [accounting](../a/accounting.md) specifically deals with government reporting requirements. It encompasses the preparation of tax returns and the planning of future tax [obligations](../o/obligation.md) to ensure compliance and optimize tax burdens. 

## Objectives of Tax Accounting

Tax [accounting](../a/accounting.md) serves several critical objectives:

1. **Compliance**: Ensuring that the tax returns filed are in accordance with the laws and regulations put forth by tax authorities.
2. **[Efficiency](../e/efficiency.md)**: Strategically planning financial affairs to minimize tax liabilities legally.
3. **Accuracy**: Guaranteeing that all financial records are accurate and align with tax laws to prevent penalties and audits.
4. **[Transparency](../t/transparency.md)**: Providing a transparent view of tax [obligations](../o/obligation.md) to stakeholders such as shareholders, partners, and regulatory bodies.

## Types of Tax Accounting

### Individual Tax Accounting

Individual tax [accounting](../a/accounting.md) deals with the tax [obligations](../o/obligation.md) of individuals. This encompasses [income](../i/income.md) from employment, investments, and other [personal income](../p/personal_income.md) sources. 

- **Wages and Salary**: Tax computed on [income](../i/income.md) derived from employment.

- **[Income](../i/income.md) Recognition**: [Income](../i/income.md) is recorded when cash is received, regardless of when it was earned.
- **[Expense](../e/expense.md) Recognition**: Expenses are recorded when they are paid, not when incurred.

### Accrual Basis Accounting

Accrual [basis](../b/basis.md) [accounting](../a/accounting.md) recognizes [income](../i/income.md) and expenses when they are earned or incurred, regardless of the actual [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md).

# Trend Following Strategies

## Introduction
[Trend following](../t/trend_following.md) is a popular trading strategy employed in the realm of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). Unlike other [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) that focus on predicting market reversals or identifying undervalued stocks, [trend following](../t/trend_following.md) strategies concentrate on market momentum by identifying and capitalizing on the direction in which the market is moving. The core principle behind [trend following](../t/trend_following.md) is that prices, whether of stocks, commodities, currencies, or other assets, tend to follow trends. Once a trend is identified, traders can benefit by entering positions in the direction of that trend until there are indications of a reversal.

## Historical Background
The concept of [trend following](../t/trend_following.md) is not new and has its origins in the early 20th century. One of the earliest adopters of [trend following](../t/trend_following.md) strategies was Richard Donchian, who is often considered the "father of [trend following](../t/trend_following.md)." He developed a trend-following system based on moving averages and was one of the pioneers in using mechanical rules for trading.

Later, in the 1980s, the Turtle Traders, a group of novice traders trained by Richard Dennis and William Eckhardt, demonstrated the effectiveness of [trend following](../t/trend_following.md). Despite having little to no prior trading experience, the Turtle Traders achieved significant success by strictly adhering to [trend following](../t/trend_following.md) rules.

## Core Principles of Trend Following
Several foundational principles underpin [trend following](../t/trend_following.md) strategies:

1. **Price Behavior**: Trend followers believe that the only reliable source of information is the price itself. Hence, they primarily base their trading decisions on price movements rather than fundamental data.
  
2. **[Positive Expectancy](../p/positive_expectancy.md)**: [Trend following](../t/trend_following.md) systems are designed to achieve [positive expectancy](../p/positive_expectancy.md), which means that the overall profits from a series of trades should outweigh the losses. This is typically achieved through a combination of high reward-to-risk ratios and robust [risk management](../r/risk_management.md).

3. **Cutting Losses**: One of the cardinal rules in [trend following](../t/trend_following.md) is to cut losses quickly. This involves setting [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md) to exit positions when the market moves against the trader's position by a predefined amount.

4. **Letting Profits Run**: Conversely, trend followers aim to let their profitable positions run as long as the trend persists. This often involves trailing stop orders that adjust with the price movement.

5. **[Systematic Trading](../s/systematic_trading.md)**: [Trend following](../t/trend_following.md) strategies are largely rule-based and are implemented through [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) systems. This ensures that trading decisions are consistent and free from emotional biases.

## Common Trend Following Indicators
Several [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) are commonly used in [trend following](../t/trend_following.md) strategies:

1. **Moving Averages**: Simple Moving Averages (SMA) and Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) are used to identify the direction of the trend. Common techniques include the use of single moving averages, [moving average crossovers](../m/moving_average_crossovers.md), and moving average envelopes.

2. **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**: This indicator helps to identify changes in the strength, direction, momentum, and duration of a trend in a stock's price.

3. **[Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md)**: These are used to measure market volatility and identify overbought or oversold conditions. They consist of a middle band representing a moving average, an upper band, and a lower band.

4. **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: RSI measures the speed and change of price movements and can indicate whether a security is overbought or oversold.

## Implementation of Trend Following Strategies
The implementation of [trend following](../t/trend_following.md) strategies in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) involves several steps, including data collection, indicator calculation, signal generation, [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), and execution.

### Data Collection
Accurate and high-quality historical and [real-time market data](../r/real-time_market_data.md) is essential for developing and executing [trend following](../t/trend_following.md) strategies. This includes price data, volume data, and other relevant financial metrics.

### Indicator Calculation
Once the data is collected, the next step is to calculate the relevant [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md). This requires the use of programming languages such as Python, R, or financial platforms like MetaTrader and [TradeStation](../t/tradestation.md).

### Signal Generation
Based on the calculated indicators, [trading signals](../t/trading_signals.md) are generated. These signals dictate when to enter or exit positions. For example, a common signal might be to buy when the price crosses above a moving average and sell when it crosses below.

### Risk Management
[Risk management](../r/risk_management.md) is a crucial component of [trend following](../t/trend_following.md). This involves setting [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md), [position sizing](../p/position_sizing.md), and implementing risk limits to ensure that potential losses are contained.

### Execution
The final step is the execution of trades. In [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), this is often automated to ensure speed and accuracy. Algorithms can be designed to execute trades based on the generated signals without human intervention.

## Advantages of Trend Following Strategies
1. **Simplicity**: [Trend following](../t/trend_following.md) strategies are relatively simple to understand and implement compared to other more complex strategies.
  
2. **Robustness**: These strategies can be applied across various asset classes and market conditions.

3. **Profitable in Trending Markets**: [Trend following](../t/trend_following.md) strategies can be highly profitable in strongly trending markets, as they aim to capture large price movements.

4. **Emotion-Free Trading**: Being systematic and rule-based, these strategies help eliminate emotional biases from trading decisions.

## Challenges and Limitations
1. **Choppy Markets**: [Trend following](../t/trend_following.md) strategies can underperform in range-bound or choppy markets, where prices do not exhibit clear trends.

2. **Late Entry and Exit**: These strategies often result in late entries and exits, as they wait for confirmation of trends, leading to missed opportunities and increased slippage.

3. **High Drawdowns**: [Trend following](../t/trend_following.md) strategies can experience significant drawdowns, especially during prolonged periods of market consolidation.

4. **Transaction Costs**: Frequent trading can lead to high transaction costs, which can erode profits.

# Trend Following Strategies

## Introduction
[Trend following](../t/trend_following.md) is a popular [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) employed in the realm of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). Unlike other [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) that focus on predicting [market](../m/market.md) reversals or identifying [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md), [trend following](../t/trend_following.md) strategies concentrate on [market](../m/market.md) [momentum](../m/momentum.md) by identifying and capitalizing on the direction in which the [market](../m/market.md) is moving. The core principle behind [trend following](../t/trend_following.md) is that prices, whether of [stocks](../s/stock.md), commodities, currencies, or other assets, tend to follow trends. Once a [trend](../t/trend.md) is identified, traders can benefit by entering positions in the direction of that [trend](../t/trend.md) until there are indications of a [reversal](../r/reversal.md).

## Historical Background
The concept of [trend following](../t/trend_following.md) is not new and has its origins in the early 20th century. One of the earliest adopters of [trend following](../t/trend_following.md) strategies was Richard Donchian, who is often considered the "father of [trend following](../t/trend_following.md)." He developed a [trend](../t/trend.md)-following system based on moving averages and was one of the pioneers in using mechanical rules for trading.

Later, in the 1980s, the Turtle Traders, a group of novice traders trained by Richard Dennis and William Eckhardt, demonstrated the effectiveness of [trend following](../t/trend_following.md). Despite having little to no prior trading experience, the Turtle Traders achieved significant success by strictly adhering to [trend following](../t/trend_following.md) rules.

## Core Principles of Trend Following
Several foundational principles underpin [trend following](../t/trend_following.md) strategies:

1. **Price Behavior**: [Trend](../t/trend.md) followers believe that the only reliable source of information is the price itself. Hence, they primarily base their trading decisions on price movements rather than fundamental data.
  
2. **[Positive Expectancy](../p/positive_expectancy.md)**: [Trend following](../t/trend_following.md) systems are designed to achieve [positive expectancy](../p/positive_expectancy.md), which means that the overall profits from a series of trades should outweigh the losses. This is typically achieved through a combination of high reward-to-[risk](../r/risk.md) ratios and [robust](../r/robust.md) [risk management](../r/risk_management.md).

3. **Cutting Losses**: One of the cardinal rules in [trend following](../t/trend_following.md) is to cut losses quickly. This involves setting [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md) to exit positions when the [market](../m/market.md) moves against the [trader](../t/trader.md)'s position by a predefined amount.

4. **Letting Profits Run**: Conversely, [trend](../t/trend.md) followers aim to let their profitable positions run as long as the [trend](../t/trend.md) persists. This often involves [trailing stop](../t/trailing_stop.md) orders that adjust with the price movement.

5. **[Systematic Trading](../s/systematic_trading.md)**: [Trend following](../t/trend_following.md) strategies are largely rule-based and are implemented through [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) systems. This ensures that trading decisions are consistent and free from emotional biases.

## Common Trend Following Indicators
Several [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) are commonly used in [trend following](../t/trend_following.md) strategies:

1. **Moving Averages**: Simple Moving Averages (SMA) and Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) are used to identify the direction of the [trend](../t/trend.md). Common techniques include the use of single moving averages, [moving average crossovers](../m/moving_average_crossovers.md), and moving average envelopes.

2. **Moving Average Convergence [Divergence](../d/divergence.md) (MACD)**: This [indicator](../i/indicator.md) helps to identify changes in the strength, direction, [momentum](../m/momentum.md), and [duration](../d/duration.md) of a [trend](../t/trend.md) in a stock's price.

3. **[Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md)**: These are used to measure [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and identify [overbought](../o/overbought.md) or [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions. They consist of a middle band representing a moving average, an upper band, and a lower band.

4. **[Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (RSI)**: RSI measures the speed and change of price movements and can indicate whether a [security](../s/security.md) is [overbought](../o/overbought.md) or [oversold](../o/oversold.md).

## Implementation of Trend Following Strategies
The implementation of [trend following](../t/trend_following.md) strategies in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) involves several steps, including data collection, [indicator](../i/indicator.md) calculation, signal generation, [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), and [execution](../e/execution.md).

### Data Collection
Accurate and high-quality historical and [real-time market data](../r/real-time_market_data.md) is essential for developing and executing [trend following](../t/trend_following.md) strategies. This includes price data, [volume](../v/volume.md) data, and other relevant financial metrics.

### Indicator Calculation
Once the data is collected, the next step is to calculate the relevant [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md). This requires the use of programming languages such as Python, R, or financial platforms like MetaTrader and [TradeStation](../t/tradestation.md).

### Signal Generation
Based on the calculated indicators, [trading signals](../t/trading_signals.md) are generated. These signals dictate when to enter or exit positions. For example, a common signal might be to buy when the price crosses above a moving average and sell when it crosses below.

### Risk Management
[Risk management](../r/risk_management.md) is a crucial component of [trend following](../t/trend_following.md). This involves setting [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md), [position sizing](../p/position_sizing.md), and implementing [risk](../r/risk.md) limits to ensure that potential losses are contained.

### Execution
The final step is the [execution](../e/execution.md) of trades. In [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), this is often automated to ensure speed and accuracy. Algorithms can be designed to execute trades based on the generated signals without human intervention.

## Advantages of Trend Following Strategies
1. **Simplicity**: [Trend following](../t/trend_following.md) strategies are relatively simple to understand and implement compared to other more complex strategies.
  
2. **Robustness**: These strategies can be applied across various [asset](../a/asset.md) classes and [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

3. **Profitable in Trending Markets**: [Trend following](../t/trend_following.md) strategies can be highly profitable in strongly trending markets, as they aim to capture large price movements.

4. **Emotion-Free Trading**: Being systematic and rule-based, these strategies help eliminate emotional biases from trading decisions.

## Challenges and Limitations
1. **Choppy Markets**: [Trend following](../t/trend_following.md) strategies can [underperform](../u/underperform.md) in [range](../r/range.md)-bound or choppy markets, where prices do not exhibit clear trends.

2. **Late Entry and Exit**: These strategies often result in late entries and exits, as they wait for confirmation of trends, leading to missed opportunities and increased [slippage](../s/slippage.md).

3. **High Drawdowns**: [Trend following](../t/trend_following.md) strategies can experience significant drawdowns, especially during prolonged periods of [market](../m/market.md) [consolidation](../c/consolidation.md).

4. **[Transaction Costs](../t/transaction_costs.md)**: Frequent trading can lead to high [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md), which can erode profits.

For those interested in developing their own [trend following](../t/trend_following.md) algorithms, the following steps serve as a guide:

1. **Define Objectives**: Establish what you aim to achieve with the [trend following](../t/trend_following.md) strategy. Are you looking for short-term gains, long-term growth, or hedging existing positions?

2. **Select Indicators**: Choose the appropriate [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) that align with your strategy objectives. This could be a combination of moving averages, RSI, MACD, etc.

3. **Develop [Trading Rules](../t/trading_rules.md)**: Create clear and concise rules for entering and exiting positions. These rules should be based on the selected indicators and should include [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) protocols such as stop-loss and take-[profit](../p/profit.md) levels.

4. **[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md)**: Test your strategy against historical data to evaluate its performance. This helps to identify potential shortcomings and areas for improvement.

5. **[Optimization](../o/optimization.md)**: Refine the strategy parameters to enhance performance, ensuring that the improvements are realistic and not a result of [overfitting](../o/overfitting.md).

6. **Paper Trading**: Implement the strategy in a simulated environment to observe its performance in real-time without [financial risk](../f/financial_risk.md).

7. **Live Trading**: Once the strategy has proven to be [robust](../r/robust.md) and profitable in simulated conditions, it can be deployed in a live [trading environment](../t/trading_environment.md). Continuous monitoring and periodic adjustments are essential to maintain its efficacy.

# Trend following

Trend following is a type of trading strategy that aims to capitalize on the upward or downward market trends. Unlike other [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) that rely on predicting market movements, trend followers believe trends persist and that prices will continue moving in the same direction until a reversal occurs. This strategy has been widely used in various financial markets, including stocks, commodities, forex, and more.

## Origins and Philosophy

Trend following is rooted in the age-old adage, "the trend is your friend." The concept was popularized in the 1980s and 1990s by a group of traders known as the "Turtle Traders." Richard Dennis and William Eckhardt, two prominent traders, conducted an experiment to teach a group of novices the trend-following strategy, and these "Turtles" went on to achieve remarkable success.

The fundamental idea behind trend following is that markets are sometimes inefficient, and prices can be driven by the emotions and behaviors of market participants rather than rational analysis. Followers of this strategy aim to exploit these inefficiencies by identifying and riding trends.

## Key Components of Trend Following

### 1. Identification of Trends

The first step in trend following is to identify a trend. This can be achieved using various [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) tools such as moving averages, trendlines, and indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) or the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). The goal is to determine whether an asset is trending upwards (bullish trend) or downwards (bearish trend).

### 2. Entry and Exit Points

Once a trend is identified, trend followers need to determine when to enter and exit the market. This is typically done using specific rules or signals generated by [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md). For example, a common entry signal might be when the price crosses above a moving average, while an exit signal might occur when the price crosses below a moving average.

### 3. Risk Management

[Risk management](../r/risk_management.md) is crucial in trend following to protect capital and limit losses. Trend followers often use techniques such as [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md), [position sizing](../p/position_sizing.md), and trailing stops to manage risk. For instance, a stop-loss order can be placed below a recent low (in an uptrend) to limit potential losses if the trend reverses.

### 4. Diversification

Many trend followers diversify their portfolios across multiple assets and markets. This helps spread risk and increases the chances of capturing profitable trends in different areas. Diversification can be achieved by trading various asset classes, such as stocks, commodities, currencies, or bonds.

### 5. Discipline and Patience

Trend following requires a high degree of discipline and patience. Trends can take time to develop, and there may be periods of consolidation or minor reversals. Successful trend followers stick to their predefined rules and avoid making emotional decisions based on short-term market fluctuations.

## Common Strategies in Trend Following

### Moving Average Crossovers

One of the simplest and most commonly used trend-following strategies involves [moving average crossovers](../m/moving_average_crossovers.md). This strategy uses two moving averages (e.g., a short-term and a long-term moving average) to generate buy and sell signals. When the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average, it signals a buy, and when it crosses below, it signals a sell.

### Breakout Trading

[Breakout trading](../b/breakout_trading.md) is another popular trend-following strategy that involves identifying key levels of [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md). When the price breaks above a resistance level or below a support level, it indicates a potential trend and triggers a trade. Trend followers use breakout signals to enter positions and ride the ensuing trend.

### Trendlines and Channels

Trendlines and channels are visual tools used to identify and trade trends. A trendline is drawn by connecting consecutive higher lows in an uptrend or consecutive lower highs in a downtrend. Channels are created by drawing parallel lines to the trendline, forming a price channel. Traders use these tools to identify entry and exit points and to gauge the strength of a trend.

### Technical Indicators

Various [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) are used in trend-following strategies to generate signals and confirm trends. Popular indicators include the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), the Relative Strength Index (RSI), the Average Directional Index (ADX), and the [Parabolic SAR](../p/parabolic_sar.md). These indicators help traders identify trends, measure their strength, and determine potential reversal points.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

1. **Simplicity**: Trend following is relatively simple to implement, making it accessible to both novice and experienced traders.
2. **Profit Potential**: This strategy can generate significant profits during strong trends, as it aims to capture large price movements.
3. **Objective Rules**: Trend-following strategies are based on predefined rules and [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md), reducing the impact of emotional decision-making.
4. **Diversification**: Trend followers can diversify their portfolios across multiple assets and markets, spreading risk and increasing the chances of capturing profitable trends.

### Disadvantages

1. **Whipsaws**: Trend followers can be susceptible to whipsaws, where prices make sudden reversals, leading to losses or false signals.
2. **Drawdowns**: The strategy may experience significant drawdowns during periods of consolidation or choppy markets when trends are not well-defined.
3. **Delayed Entries**: Trend-following signals are often [lagging indicators](../l/lagging_indicators.md), meaning that traders may enter positions after a significant portion of the trend has already occurred.
4. **Market Conditions**: Trend following performs best in trending markets and may struggle during periods of low volatility or sideways movement.

# Trend following

[Trend](../t/trend.md) following is a type of [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) that aims to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on the upward or downward [market](../m/market.md) trends. Unlike other [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) that rely on predicting [market](../m/market.md) movements, [trend](../t/trend.md) followers believe trends persist and that prices [will](../w/will.md) continue moving in the same direction until a [reversal](../r/reversal.md) occurs. This strategy has been widely used in various [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), including [stocks](../s/stock.md), commodities, forex, and more.

## Origins and Philosophy

[Trend](../t/trend.md) following is rooted in the age-old adage, "the [trend](../t/trend.md) is your friend." The concept was popularized in the 1980s and 1990s by a group of traders known as the "Turtle Traders." Richard Dennis and William Eckhardt, two prominent traders, conducted an experiment to teach a group of novices the [trend](../t/trend.md)-following strategy, and these "Turtles" went on to achieve remarkable success.

The fundamental idea behind [trend](../t/trend.md) following is that markets are sometimes inefficient, and prices can be driven by the emotions and behaviors of [market](../m/market.md) participants rather than rational analysis. Followers of this strategy aim to exploit these inefficiencies by identifying and riding trends.

## Key Components of Trend Following

### 1. Identification of Trends

The first step in [trend](../t/trend.md) following is to identify a [trend](../t/trend.md). This can be achieved using various [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) tools such as moving averages, trendlines, and indicators like the [Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index.md) (RSI) or the Moving Average Convergence [Divergence](../d/divergence.md) (MACD). The goal is to determine whether an [asset](../a/asset.md) is trending upwards (bullish [trend](../t/trend.md)) or downwards (bearish [trend](../t/trend.md)).

### 2. Entry and Exit Points

Once a [trend](../t/trend.md) is identified, [trend](../t/trend.md) followers need to determine when to enter and exit the [market](../m/market.md). This is typically done using specific rules or signals generated by [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md). For example, a common entry signal might be when the price crosses above a moving average, while an exit signal might occur when the price crosses below a moving average.

### 3. Risk Management

[Risk management](../r/risk_management.md) is crucial in [trend](../t/trend.md) following to protect [capital](../c/capital.md) and limit losses. [Trend](../t/trend.md) followers often use techniques such as [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md), [position sizing](../p/position_sizing.md), and trailing stops to manage [risk](../r/risk.md). For instance, a [stop-loss order](../s/stop-loss_order.md) can be placed below a recent low (in an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md)) to limit potential losses if the [trend](../t/trend.md) reverses.

### 4. Diversification

Many [trend](../t/trend.md) followers diversify their portfolios across [multiple](../m/multiple.md) assets and markets. This helps spread [risk](../r/risk.md) and increases the chances of capturing profitable trends in different areas. [Diversification](../d/diversification.md) can be achieved by trading various [asset](../a/asset.md) classes, such as [stocks](../s/stock.md), commodities, currencies, or bonds.

### 5. Discipline and Patience

[Trend](../t/trend.md) following requires a high degree of discipline and patience. Trends can take time to develop, and there may be periods of [consolidation](../c/consolidation.md) or minor reversals. Successful [trend](../t/trend.md) followers stick to their predefined rules and avoid making emotional decisions based on short-term [market](../m/market.md) fluctuations.

## Common Strategies in Trend Following

### Moving Average Crossovers

One of the simplest and most commonly used [trend](../t/trend.md)-following strategies involves [moving average crossovers](../m/moving_average_crossovers.md). This strategy uses two moving averages (e.g., a short-term and a long-term moving average) to generate buy and sell signals. When the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average, it signals a buy, and when it crosses below, it signals a sell.

### Breakout Trading

[Breakout trading](../b/breakout_trading.md) is another popular [trend](../t/trend.md)-following strategy that involves identifying key levels of [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md). When the price breaks above a resistance level or below a support level, it indicates a potential [trend](../t/trend.md) and triggers a [trade](../t/trade.md). [Trend](../t/trend.md) followers use [breakout](../b/breakout.md) signals to enter positions and ride the ensuing [trend](../t/trend.md).

### Trendlines and Channels

Trendlines and channels are visual tools used to identify and [trade](../t/trade.md) trends. A [trendline](../t/trendline.md) is drawn by connecting consecutive higher lows in an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md) or consecutive lower highs in a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md). Channels are created by drawing parallel lines to the [trendline](../t/trendline.md), forming a price channel. Traders use these tools to identify entry and exit points and to gauge the strength of a [trend](../t/trend.md).

### Technical Indicators

Various [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) are used in [trend](../t/trend.md)-following strategies to generate signals and confirm trends. Popular indicators include the Moving Average Convergence [Divergence](../d/divergence.md) (MACD), the [Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index.md) (RSI), the [Average Directional Index](../a/average_directional_index_(adx).md) (ADX), and the [Parabolic SAR](../p/parabolic_sar.md). These indicators help traders identify trends, measure their strength, and determine potential [reversal](../r/reversal.md) points.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

1. **Simplicity**: [Trend](../t/trend.md) following is relatively simple to implement, making it accessible to both novice and experienced traders.
2. **[Profit](../p/profit.md) Potential**: This strategy can generate significant profits during strong trends, as it aims to capture large price movements.
3. **Objective Rules**: [Trend](../t/trend.md)-following strategies are based on predefined rules and [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md), reducing the impact of emotional decision-making.
4. **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: [Trend](../t/trend.md) followers can diversify their portfolios across [multiple](../m/multiple.md) assets and markets, spreading [risk](../r/risk.md) and increasing the chances of capturing profitable trends.

### Disadvantages

1. **Whipsaws**: [Trend](../t/trend.md) followers can be susceptible to whipsaws, where prices make sudden reversals, leading to losses or [false signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md).
2. **Drawdowns**: The strategy may experience significant drawdowns during periods of [consolidation](../c/consolidation.md) or choppy markets when trends are not well-defined.
3. **Delayed Entries**: [Trend](../t/trend.md)-following signals are often [lagging indicators](../l/lagging_indicators.md), meaning that traders may enter positions after a significant portion of the [trend](../t/trend.md) has already occurred.
4. **[Market](../m/market.md) Conditions**: [Trend](../t/trend.md) following performs best in trending markets and may struggle during periods of low [volatility](../v/volatility.md) or sideways movement.

# Triple Top Pattern

The **Triple Top** pattern is a chart pattern used in technical analysis to predict the reversal of an upward trend in the price of an asset. The formation of a triple top signals that the asset is struggling to break through a consistent level of resistance and suggests a potential decline in price. This pattern is typically used by traders to identify potential selling opportunities or to signal a bearish market. 

### Components of the Triple Top Pattern

1. **Three Peaks**: The most prominent feature of the [triple top](../t/triple_top.md) pattern is three distinct peaks. These peaks are approximately equal in price and occur after a sustained upward trend.
2. **Horizontal Resistance Line**: The horizontal resistance line connects the peaks and represents a price level that the asset has failed to exceed on three separate occasions.
3. **Declining Volume**: Volume often decreases with each successive peak, indicating diminishing buying interest.
4. **Confirmation Line**: This is the support level that the price needs to break through after forming the third peak to confirm the pattern. It is often drawn at the lowest point of the pattern between the peaks.

### Formation and Identification

To identify a [triple top](../t/triple_top.md) pattern, traders should look for the following criteria in a price chart:
- An existing upward trend leading into the pattern.
- Three peaks that are approximately equal in height.
- A relatively equal support level near the base of the peaks.
- Diminishing trading volume as the pattern develops.

### Trading the Triple Top Pattern

#### Entry and Exit Points

- **Entry Point**: Traders typically enter a short position when the price breaks below the support level (confirmation line) after completing the third peak. The breakout should ideally be accompanied by a significant increase in volume.
- **Stop-Loss Level**: A stop-loss is often placed just above the third peak to limit potential losses in case the breakout turns out to be a false signal.
- **Profit Target**: The potential price decline following a [triple top](../t/triple_top.md) can be estimated by measuring the distance from the peaks to the support level and projecting this distance downward from the support break.

#### Example

Let's consider an example where a stock has formed a [triple top](../t/triple_top.md) pattern with peaks at $100, $102, and $101, and the support level is at $95. When the price breaks below $95, a trader might enter a short position. If the distance from the peaks to the support level is $7 (e.g., $102 - $95), the trader might set a profit target of $88 ($95 - $7).

### Variations and Related Patterns

#### Triple Bottom Pattern

The opposite of the [triple top](../t/triple_top.md) is the **[Triple Bottom](../t/triple_bottom.md)** pattern, which signals a bullish reversal after a sustained downward trend. It consists of three troughs of approximately equal depth and indicates a potential upward movement in price.

### Practical Considerations and Limitations

While the [triple top](../t/triple_top.md) pattern is a useful tool for predicting potential trend reversals, it is important to consider the following:
- **False Breakouts**: False breakouts can occur, leading to premature entries or exits.
- **Market Conditions**: Broader market conditions and external factors should be considered as they can impact the reliability of the pattern.
- **[Volume Analysis](../v/volume_analysis.md)**: Confirming the pattern with [volume analysis](../v/volume_analysis.md) can increase the probability of a successful trade.

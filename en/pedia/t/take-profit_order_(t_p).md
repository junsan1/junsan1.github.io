# Take-Profit Order (T/P)

A Take-[Profit](../p/profit.md) [Order](../o/order.md) (often abbreviated as T/P) is a type of [order](../o/order.md) placed with a [broker](../b/broker.md) to sell a [security](../s/security.md) when it reaches a certain [price level](../p/price_level.md). This type of [order](../o/order.md) is used by traders to [lock in profits](../l/lock_in_profits.md) once the [security](../s/security.md) hits a predetermined price, which effectively automates the process of selling at a [profit](../p/profit.md) target, mitigating emotional influences that may impede trading decisions.

## Understanding Take-Profit Orders

### Definition and Purpose 
A Take-[Profit](../p/profit.md) [Order](../o/order.md) is designed to close a [trade](../t/trade.md) at a specific favorable price set by the [trader](../t/trader.md). The main purpose of this [order](../o/order.md) type is to secure profits in the volatile [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). By setting a take-[profit](../p/profit.md) point, traders can ensure that their positions [will](../w/will.md) be closed, capturing gains when the target level is reached. This can be particularly beneficial for traders who may not always be able to monitor the [market](../m/market.md).

### How It Works
When a [trader](../t/trader.md) places a T/P [order](../o/order.md), the [order](../o/order.md) specifies the particular level at which the [asset](../a/asset.md) should be sold or bought. For long positions, the T/P [order](../o/order.md) [will](../w/will.md) be set above the entry price, and for short positions, it [will](../w/will.md) be set below the entry price. Once the [market price](../m/market_price.md) hits the specified level, the T/P [order](../o/order.md) is triggered, and the [trade](../t/trade.md) is executed automatically at the specified price or close to it.

### Components
1. **Entry Price**: The price at which the [security](../s/security.md) is bought or sold initially.
2. **Take-[Profit](../p/profit.md) Level**: The predetermined price at which the position should be closed to realize the desired [profit](../p/profit.md).

## Placement and Strategies

### Setting Up a Take-Profit Order
1. **Analyze the [Market](../m/market.md)**: Before placing a T/P [order](../o/order.md), thorough [market](../m/market.md) analysis is essential. This involves understanding the current trends, [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels, and any forthcoming news that might influence the [market](../m/market.md).
2. **Determine the Take-[Profit](../p/profit.md) Level**: Based on [technical analysis tools](../t/technical_analysis_tools.md) such as Fibonacci retracements, [pivot points](../p/pivot_points.md), or using [risk](../r/risk.md)/reward ratios, traders can choose an appropriate take-[profit](../p/profit.md) level.
3. **Submit the [Order](../o/order.md)**: Most trading platforms allow you to set T/P orders directly through their interfaces. Enter the T/P level when placing the initial [trade](../t/trade.md) or modify the [order](../o/order.md) afterward.

### Strategies Involving T/P Orders
1. **[Scalping](../s/scalping.md)**: In this highly active [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md), traders often use T/P orders to capture small profits. Due to the quick nature of [scalping](../s/scalping.md), having automated T/P points can assist in executing trades efficiently.
2. **[Swing Trading](../s/swing_trading.md)**: Swing traders typically [hold](../h/hold.md) positions for several days or weeks. T/P orders can help capture profits from the medium-term price swings.
3. **[Day Trading](../d/day_trading.md)**: Day traders, who seldom [hold](../h/hold.md) positions overnight, rely heavily on T/P orders to ensure they [lock in profits](../l/lock_in_profits.md) throughout the trading day.

## Benefits

### Emotion Control
By setting a take-[profit](../p/profit.md) level, traders can prevent the emotional decision-making processes that occur when monitoring each price movement in real time. This discipline ensures that profits are taken at predetermined levels.

### Automation
T/P orders automate the selling process, helping traders step away from their screens without the [risk](../r/risk.md) of losing potential gains. Automated [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), therefore, include T/P levels to meet [profit](../p/profit.md) targets systematically.

### Risk Management
Take-[profit](../p/profit.md) orders work hand-in-hand with [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md) to form a comprehensive [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) strategy. While the T/P ensures that profits are captured, the stop-loss limits potential losses, [offering](../o/offering.md) a balanced approach to trading.

## Risks and Limitations

### Market Volatility
One downside of T/P orders is that during high [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md), the price might quickly move to the set take-[profit](../p/profit.md) level and continue moving past it, preventing a [trader](../t/trader.md) from capturing additional profits.

### Missed Opportunities
If the [market](../m/market.md) approaches the take-[profit](../p/profit.md) level but doesn't quite reach it, a [trader](../t/trader.md) might miss valuable profits if the price subsequently reverses direction.

### Slippage
In fast-moving markets, [execution](../e/execution.md) at the exact take-[profit](../p/profit.md) level might not be possible, and trades might be executed at a slightly different price, known as [slippage](../s/slippage.md). This can affect realized gains.

## Real-World Applications

In modern [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), T/P orders are a staple for both individual traders and institutional investors. [Automated trading systems](../a/automated_trading_systems.md) such as [algorithmic trading strategies](../a/algorithmic_trading_strategies.md) equally [leverage](../l/leverage.md) T/P orders to optimize [trading performance](../t/trading_performance.md).

### Example: Forex Trading
In the forex [market](../m/market.md), a [trader](../t/trader.md) might place a T/P [order](../o/order.md) 50 pips above their entry price on a long position. If the [market](../m/market.md) reaches this level, the [order](../o/order.md) executes automatically, and profits are secured.

### Example: Stock Market
Consider a stock [trader](../t/trader.md) who buys [shares](../s/shares.md) at $100 with a T/P set at $110. If the stock price hits $110, the [shares](../s/shares.md) are sold automatically, achieving the desired [profit](../p/profit.md) without manual intervention.

## Tools and Platforms

### Trading Platforms with T/P Orders
- **MetaTrader 4/5**: Popular trading platforms in the forex [market](../m/market.md) allowing easy setup of T/P orders.
- **[Interactive Brokers](../i/interactive_brokers.md)**: Provides T/P functionality for [stocks](../s/stock.md), [options](../o/options.md), and [futures](../f/futures.md) trading. [Interactive Brokers](https://www.interactivebrokers.com)
- **Thinkorswim**: [Trading platform](../t/trading_platform.md) by TD [Ameritrade](../a/ameritrade.md) [offering](../o/offering.md) advanced [order types](../o/order_types_in_trading.md) including T/P. [Thinkorswim](https://www.tdameritrade.com/tools-and-platforms/thinkorswim.page)

### Algorithmic Trading 
[Automated trading systems](../a/automated_trading_systems.md), including those used for high-frequency trading (HFT), often incorporate T/P orders to systematically [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on [profit](../p/profit.md) opportunities within milliseconds.

## Conclusion

Take-[Profit](../p/profit.md) Orders are fundamental tools for traders across various markets, enabling them to [lock in profits](../l/lock_in_profits.md), automate their [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), and manage [risk](../r/risk.md) effectively. By establishing clear [profit](../p/profit.md) targets, traders can safeguard their gains while navigating the complexities of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). Whether used in manual trading or integrated into automated systems, the T/P [order](../o/order.md)'s role is indispensable in achieving consistent trading success.

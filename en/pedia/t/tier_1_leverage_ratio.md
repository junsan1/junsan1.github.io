# Tier 1 Leverage Ratio

The Tier 1 [Leverage Ratio](../l/leverage_ratio.md) is a critical regulatory metric utilized within the banking and financial sectors to measure the core [capital](../c/capital.md) strength of financial institutions. By ensuring a certain level of [capital](../c/capital.md) adequacy, this ratio plays a vital role in maintaining the stability and soundness of the global [financial system](../f/financial_system.md).

## Definition

The Tier 1 [Leverage Ratio](../l/leverage_ratio.md) is the ratio of a [bank](../b/bank.md)'s [Tier 1 capital](../t/tier_1_capital.md) to its total exposure. [Tier 1 capital](../t/tier_1_capital.md), often referred to as the [bank](../b/bank.md)'s "core [capital](../c/capital.md)," includes the most reliable and [liquid](../l/liquid.md) [capital](../c/capital.md), such as common [equity](../e/equity.md) and disclosed reserves. Total exposure, on the other hand, encompasses both on-[balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) assets and certain off-[balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) exposures.

Mathematically, the Tier 1 [Leverage Ratio](../l/leverage_ratio.md) can be expressed as:

```text
Tier 1 [Leverage Ratio](../l/leverage_ratio.md) = ([Tier 1 Capital](../t/tier_1_capital.md) / Total Exposure) * 100%
```

## Components

### Tier 1 Capital

[Tier 1 Capital](../t/tier_1_capital.md) is composed of high-quality [capital](../c/capital.md) that is readily available to absorb losses. The components generally include:

1. **Common [Equity](../e/equity.md) Tier 1 (CET1)**: This consists of common [shares](../s/shares.md), stock [surplus](../s/surplus.md) (resulting from the [issue](../i/issue.md) of common [shares](../s/shares.md)), [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md), and other [comprehensive income](../c/comprehensive_income.md).
2. **Additional Tier 1 (AT1) [Capital](../c/capital.md)**: This may include instruments such as non-cumulative perpetual [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md), and [contingent convertible](../c/contingent_convertible.md) [capital](../c/capital.md) (CoCos).

### Total Exposure

Total Exposure captures a [bank](../b/bank.md)'s overall exposure to [risk](../r/risk.md) and includes a combination of the following:

1. **On-[Balance Sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) Exposures**: This includes all assets on the [bank](../b/bank.md)â€™s [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md), excluding [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) and securities [financing](../f/financing.md) transactions (SFTs), which are accounted for separately.
2. **Off-[Balance Sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) Exposures**: This may include various forms of contingent liabilities such as guarantees and letters of [credit](../c/credit.md).
3. **[Derivative](../d/derivative.md) Exposures**: The exposure values for [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) calculated using either the Current Exposure Method (CEM) or the Standardized Approach for measuring [Counterparty](../c/counterparty.md) [Credit Risk](../c/credit_risk.md) (SA-CCR).
4. **Securities [Financing](../f/financing.md) Transactions (SFTs)**: Exposures arising from transactions such as repurchase agreements and [securities lending](../s/securities_lending.md).

## Regulatory Framework

The Tier 1 [Leverage Ratio](../l/leverage_ratio.md) is part of the [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md) regulatory framework, which was introduced by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) to enhance the regulation, supervision, and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) within the banking sector. The ratio aims to:

1. Serve as a simple, transparent, and non-[risk](../r/risk.md)-based backstop measure to the [risk](../r/risk.md)-based [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements.
2. Constrain the build-up of excessive [leverage](../l/leverage.md) in the banking sector.

### Basel III Requirement

Under [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md), a minimum Tier 1 [Leverage Ratio](../l/leverage_ratio.md) of 3% is required. This was introduced as a safeguard to ensure that even if [risk](../r/risk.md) weights are underestimated, banks still maintain a [baseline](../b/baseline.md) level of [capital](../c/capital.md) relative to their size.

Some jurisdictions and regulators impose more stringent requirements. The U.S. Federal Reserve, for example, applies a higher standard for the largest U.S. banks, commonly referred to as the Enhanced Supplementary [Leverage Ratio](../l/leverage_ratio.md) (eSLR), requiring a ratio above 5%.

## Importance in the Banking Sector

### Risk Mitigation

A high Tier 1 [Leverage Ratio](../l/leverage_ratio.md) indicates a greater capacity to withstand financial and economic stress, reducing the likelihood of [bank](../b/bank.md) [insolvency](../i/insolvency.md). It ensures that banks have enough core [capital](../c/capital.md) to sustain losses while maintaining operations and protecting depositors' interests.

### Market Confidence

A [robust](../r/robust.md) Tier 1 [Leverage Ratio](../l/leverage_ratio.md) bolsters [market](../m/market.md) confidence as it underscores the [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and stability of banking institutions. Investors and stakeholders can better [trust](../t/trust.md) banks with higher ratios to deliver consistent performance amidst [market](../m/market.md) fluctuations.

### Regulatory Compliance

Meeting or exceeding the regulatory minimum for the Tier 1 [Leverage Ratio](../l/leverage_ratio.md) is paramount for banks to operate within legal frameworks. Non-compliance can result in regulatory sanctions, restrictions on [business activities](../b/business_activities.md), and potential reputational damage.

## Practical Implications

### Balance Sheet Management

Banks actively manage their balance sheets to optimize their Tier 1 [Leverage Ratio](../l/leverage_ratio.md). This can involve:

1. **[Capital](../c/capital.md) Raising**: Issuing new [shares](../s/shares.md) or instruments qualifying as [Tier 1 capital](../t/tier_1_capital.md).
2. **[Asset](../a/asset.md) Reduction**: Selling or securitizing assets to reduce total exposure.
3. **[Derivative](../d/derivative.md) and SFT Management**: Actively managing exposure from [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) and SFTs through [netting](../n/netting.md) and [collateral](../c/collateral.md) arrangements.

### Strategic Decision-Making

The [leverage ratio](../l/leverage_ratio.md) influences strategic decision-making by banks. Institutions with low ratios might limit [loan](../l/loan.md) growth or reduce off-[balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) exposures to improve their metrics. Conversely, banks with higher ratios may pursue [expansion](../e/expansion.md) opportunities more aggressively.

## Conclusion

The Tier 1 [Leverage Ratio](../l/leverage_ratio.md) is a cornerstone of modern banking regulation, designed to ensure the resilience and stability of financial institutions. Through rigorous [capital](../c/capital.md) adequacy standards, it helps mitigate systemic risks and fosters confidence among stakeholders. By understanding and managing this critical ratio, banks can better navigate the complexities of the financial landscape and contribute to broader economic stability.

# Triple Exponential Average (TRIX)

The Triple Exponential Average (TRIX) is a [momentum](../m/momentum.md) [indicator](../i/indicator.md) that displays the percent rate of change of a triple exponentially smoothed moving average of a [security](../s/security.md)'s closing price. The [indicator](../i/indicator.md) was developed by Jack Hutson in the early 1980s. It is designed to keep traders from reacting prematurely to price fluctuations by filtering out the "[noise](../n/noise.md)" that is inherent in securities trading. 

#### Components and Calculation

A TRIX line oscillates around a zero line. Positive values indicate upward [momentum](../m/momentum.md), while negative values indicate downward [momentum](../m/momentum.md). The TRIX is a much smoother [indicator](../i/indicator.md) than other typical [momentum indicators](../m/momentum_indicators.md) because it uses triple [exponential smoothing](../e/exponential_smoothing.md).

The calculation of TRIX involves three main steps:
1. **Single [Exponential Smoothing](../e/exponential_smoothing.md) (EMA1):** First, a single smoothing of the closing price over a chosen period (e.g., 15 days) is calculated:
   
   \[
   EMA1_t = \frac {P_t + (n-1) \times EMA1_{t-1}} {n}
   \]

   where \(P_t\) is the price at time \(t\) and \(n\) is the number of periods.

2. **Double [Exponential Smoothing](../e/exponential_smoothing.md) (EMA2):** Then, a second [exponential smoothing](../e/exponential_smoothing.md) is applied to the result of the first smoothing:

   \[
   EMA2_t = \frac {EMA1_t + (n-1) \times EMA2_{t-1}} {n}
   \]

3. **Triple [Exponential Smoothing](../e/exponential_smoothing.md) (EMA3):** Finally, a third [exponential smoothing](../e/exponential_smoothing.md) is applied to the result of the second smoothing:

   \[
   EMA3_t = \frac {EMA2_t + (n-1) \times EMA3_{t-1}} {n}
   \]

Once EMA3 is computed, the TRIX is derived by calculating the [percentage change](../p/percentage_change.md) between the current and previous [value](../v/value.md) of EMA3:

\[
TRIX_t = \frac {EMA3_t - EMA3_{t-1}} {EMA3_{t-1}} \times 100
\]

#### Applications in Trading

1. **[Trend](../t/trend.md) Direction:** A TRIX above zero indicates an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md), while a TRIX below zero indicates a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md).

2. **Signal Line Crossovers:** Traders often use a signal line, which is an additional moving average (usually a 9-day moving average) of the TRIX itself. The crossover of the TRIX and its signal line can be used as a buy/sell trigger:
   - **Buy Signal:** When TRIX crosses above the signal line
   - **Sell Signal:** When TRIX crosses below the signal line

3. **[Divergence](../d/divergence.md):** TRIX can show [divergence](../d/divergence.md) with the [price action](../p/price_action.md):
   - **[Bullish Divergence](../b/bullish_divergence.md):** If the prices are making new lows, but the TRIX fails to make new lows, it could be a sign of an impending bullish [reversal](../r/reversal.md).
   - **[Bearish Divergence](../b/bearish_divergence.md):** If prices are making new highs, but the TRIX fails to make new highs, it could be a sign of an impending bearish [reversal](../r/reversal.md).

#### Advantages of Using TRIX

- **[Noise](../n/noise.md) Filtration:** By using triple smoothing, TRIX eliminates a lot of the short-term [volatility](../v/volatility.md) that can result in [false signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md).
- **Simplified Analysis:** TRIX provides a single line that can indicate both the direction and [momentum](../m/momentum.md) of a [trend](../t/trend.md), simplifying the analytical process for traders.
- **[Divergence](../d/divergence.md) Signal:** As mentioned, TRIXâ€™s ability to show [divergence](../d/divergence.md) with [price action](../p/price_action.md) can signal potential reversals before they happen, giving traders a strategic advantage.

#### Limitations and Considerations

- **Lag:** Like all moving averages, the TRIX is a [lagging indicator](../l/lagging_indicator.md). It responds to price movements with a delay, meaning that it may not forecast future price movements accurately.
- **Complexity:** The triple smoothing process can be complex and might not be suitable for beginners who are unfamiliar with [exponential smoothing](../e/exponential_smoothing.md) techniques.
- **[False Signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md):** While TRIX is designed to minimize [noise](../n/noise.md), no [indicator](../i/indicator.md) is perfect. There can still be periods of low [volatility](../v/volatility.md) where TRIX may generate [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [false signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md).

#### Integration with Other Indicators

Many traders use TRIX in combination with other [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) to confirm signals and trends. Common complementary indicators include:

- **[Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (RSI):** Helps to identify [overbought](../o/overbought.md) and [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions.
- **Moving Average Convergence [Divergence](../d/divergence.md) (MACD):** Offers insights into [trend](../t/trend.md) direction and [momentum](../m/momentum.md).
- **[Volume Indicators](../v/volume_indicators.md):** Showing the strength behind price movements.

#### Conclusion

The Triple Exponential Average (TRIX) is a versatile [momentum](../m/momentum.md) [indicator](../i/indicator.md) that can be a valuable tool for traders looking to identify trends, reversals, and entry/exit points in the [market](../m/market.md). By smoothing out price data three times, TRIX aims to eliminate [noise](../n/noise.md) and focus on the true [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [trend](../t/trend.md). However, like all indicators, it is most effective when combined with other tools and methods in a comprehensive [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md).

The basic elements in the creation of a [trust](../t/trust.md) property are:

The [trust](../t/trust.md) agreement specifies the type of [trust](../t/trust.md) being established, the duties of the [trustee](../t/trustee.md), and the rights of the beneficiaries.

### Key Types of Trusts

### Investment Strategies for Trust Property

3. **Long-term Growth**: Focusing on assets with potential for long-term appreciation, such as equities or [real estate](../r/real_estate.md).
4. **Conservative Investments**: Prioritizing [capital preservation](../c/capital_preservation.md) through low-[risk](../r/risk.md) investments like bonds or [money market](../m/money_market.md) funds.

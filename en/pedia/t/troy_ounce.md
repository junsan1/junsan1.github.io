# Troy Ounce

The troy ounce is a unit of measure commonly used to quantify the weight of precious metals such as gold, silver, [platinum](../p/platinum.md), and palladium. Unlike the more common avoirdupois ounce, which is standard in the United States for most other weight measurements, the troy ounce has its own historical significance and practical applications in the world of [finance](../f/finance.md), particularly in [commodities trading](../c/commodities_trading.md).

## Definition

A troy ounce, abbreviated as "oz t" or "ozt," is defined as precisely 31.1034768 grams. This is approximately 10% heavier than the more familiar avoirdupois ounce, which weighs 28.3495231 grams. Through centuries of established usage, the troy ounce remains the standard measurement in the precious metals [industry](../i/industry.md), from [mining](../m/mining.md) and refining to trading and investment.

## History

### Origins

The term "troy ounce" originated from the Roman monetary system, and its name is derived from the medieval city of Troyes in France, an important trading hub in the Middle Ages. Over time, various regions and cultures adapted their own weight measures, but the troy weight system was standardised in England in the 1400s, largely due to its crucial role in the [trade](../t/trade.md) of precious metals.

### Adoption in the U.S.

In the United States, the troy ounce became official in 1828 following an Act of Congress, which reinforced its use primarily for coinage and bullion. The Coinage Act of 1837 further established the standardization of the troy ounce for the production of all U.S. gold and silver coins.

## Comparison to Other Measurements

Understanding the differences between the troy ounce and other weight measurements is critical for traders, investors, and anyone dealing with precious metals:

- **Troy Pound**: Consists of 12 troy ounces (373.24 grams).
- **Avoirdupois Ounce**: More commonly used in the U.S. for other products and consists of 28.3495231 grams.
- **Avoirdupois Pound**: Equally important, it has 16 avoirdupois ounces (453.59237 grams).

Hereâ€™s a quick conversion table for reference:

| Measurement                  | Troy System   | Avoirdupois System |
|------------------------------|---------------|--------------------|
| 1 Ounce                      | 31.1034768 g  | 28.3495231 g       |
| 1 Troy Pound (12 Troy Oz)    | 373.242 g     | Not Applicable     |
| 1 Avoirdupois Pound (16 Oz)  | Not Applicable| 453.59237 g        |
| 1 Gram                       | 0.0321507 oz t| 0.03527396 oz      |

## Practical Applications

Understanding the troy ounce is essential for various [industry](../i/industry.md) stakeholders, from miners and refiners to traders and investors. Here are a few key applications:

### Mining

In [mining](../m/mining.md) industries, the level of precious metal content in ore is often measured in troy ounces per ton (oz/t). This quantification assists in determining the viability and profitability of [mining](../m/mining.md) operations.

### Trading and Investments

Most financial instruments that [trade](../t/trade.md) precious metals use the troy ounce as the standard unit. This includes:

- **Bullion Coins**: Such as the American Gold Eagle and Canadian Gold Maple Leaf, which are sold and traded based on their weight in troy ounces.
- **[Futures Contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md)**: Typically [listed](../l/listed.md) on commodities exchanges like COMEX, which measure contracts in troy ounces.

### Jewelry

While jewelers may weigh [raw materials](../r/raw_materials.md) in grams or carats, the final [sale](../s/sale.md) price of the precious metals component often relates back to the price per troy ounce.

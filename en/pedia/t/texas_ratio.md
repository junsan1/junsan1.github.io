# Texas Ratio

The Texas Ratio is a financial metric used to evaluate the health of a [bank](../b/bank.md)'s [loan](../l/loan.md) portfolio. It was developed by Gerard Cassidy, a banking analyst at RBC [Capital Markets](../c/capital_markets.md), in the 1980s during the Savings and [Loan](../l/loan.md) Crisis. The Texas Ratio is specifically designed to measure a [bank](../b/bank.md)'s ability to absorb [credit](../c/credit.md) losses and indicates the likelihood of [bank](../b/bank.md) failure or [solvency](../s/solvency.md) issues.

## Calculation of the Texas Ratio

The Texas Ratio is calculated using a [bank](../b/bank.md)'s non-performing assets (NPAs) and the resources available to cover those losses, primarily tangible [equity](../e/equity.md) and [loan](../l/loan.md) loss reserves. The formula is as follows:

\[ \text{Texas Ratio} = \frac{\text{Non-performing Assets} (NPAs)}{\text{Tangible [Equity](../e/equity.md)} + \text{[Loan](../l/loan.md) Loss Reserves}} \]

### Components of the Texas Ratio

1. **Non-performing Assets (NPAs):**
   - These are loans that are in [default](../d/default.md) or close to being in [default](../d/default.md), implying the borrower is not making [interest](../i/interest.md) payments or repaying any [principal](../p/principal.md) on the [loan](../l/loan.md).
   - Non-performing assets typically include non-accrual loans, loans past due 90 days, and [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) owned due to [foreclosure](../f/foreclosure.md).

2. **Tangible [Equity](../e/equity.md):**
   - Tangible [equity](../e/equity.md) is the core [capital](../c/capital.md) of the [bank](../b/bank.md), mainly consisting of shareholders' [equity](../e/equity.md) minus intangible assets.
   - Intangible assets might include items such as [goodwill](../g/goodwill.md), patents, and trademarks which are not readily convertible to cash.

3. **[Loan](../l/loan.md) Loss Reserves:**
   - [Loan](../l/loan.md) loss reserves are funds set aside by a [bank](../b/bank.md) to cover potential losses from defaulted loans.
   - These reserves act as a buffer to absorb losses arising from the non-performing assets.

### Interpreting the Texas Ratio

- A Texas Ratio of **less than 1** (or 100%) indicates that the [bank](../b/bank.md) has sufficient tangible [equity](../e/equity.md) and [loan](../l/loan.md) loss reserves to cover its non-performing assets. This is generally considered a sign of good [financial health](../f/financial_health.md).
- A Texas Ratio of **greater than 1** (or 100%) suggests that the [bank](../b/bank.md)'s non-performing assets exceed its financial resources to cover potential losses, signaling trouble.
- Typically, a Texas Ratio of **50% or above** can raise a red flag and prompt closer scrutiny of a [bank](../b/bank.md)'s financial condition by regulators, investors, and other stakeholders.

## Significance in the Banking Sector

The Texas Ratio has pivotal significance in the banking sector due to its predictive ability regarding [bank](../b/bank.md) failures:

1. **Predictive Power:**
   - The Texas Ratio has been shown to have strong predictive power concerning [bank](../b/bank.md) failures. Banks with high Texas Ratios tend to face substantial financial difficulties, and its application was instrumental during the Savings and [Loan](../l/loan.md) Crisis and the 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md).
   
2. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md):**
   - The ratio helps banks' management in assessing the level of [risk](../r/risk.md) in their [loan](../l/loan.md) portfolios. It allows them to take preemptive measures to mitigate potential issues by either increasing [loan](../l/loan.md) loss reserves or managing their [loan](../l/loan.md) portfolios more conservatively.

3. **[Investor](../i/investor.md) Insight:**
   - For investors, the Texas Ratio provides a quick, yet effective, snapshot of a [bank](../b/bank.md)'s [financial health](../f/financial_health.md). It is especially useful for [equity](../e/equity.md) and [bond](../b/bond.md) investors looking to assess the [risk](../r/risk.md) profile of a [bank](../b/bank.md) in which they are [investing](../i/investing.md).

4. **Regulatory Focus:**
   - [Bank](../b/bank.md) regulators use the Texas Ratio as one of several metrics to monitor and evaluate the stability and [risk](../r/risk.md) of banks. A consistently high Texas Ratio might prompt regulatory intervention to prevent [bank](../b/bank.md) failure and protect depositors' interests.

## Limitations of the Texas Ratio

While the Texas Ratio is a valuable tool in assessing [bank](../b/bank.md) health, it does have some limitations:

1. **Dependency on Accurate Reporting:**
   - The effectiveness of the Texas Ratio is heavily reliant on the accurate and timely reporting of non-performing assets and [loan](../l/loan.md) loss reserves by banks. Any manipulation or delay in reporting can lead to misleading conclusions.

2. **Ignores Future [Earnings](../e/earnings.md):**
   - The Texas Ratio doesn't account for potential future [earnings](../e/earnings.md) which a [bank](../b/bank.md) could use to [offset](../o/offset.md) current non-performing assets. A [bank](../b/bank.md) with strong future [earnings](../e/earnings.md) potential might appear weaker than it truly is according to this ratio.

3. **Static Nature:**
   - The ratio provides a static snapshot, meaning it represents the [bank](../b/bank.md)'s condition at a particular point in time. It doesn't account for dynamic changes in the [bank](../b/bank.md)'s financial standing or [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md).

4. **Different Definitions:**
   - There can be [variability](../v/variability.md) in how different banks classify non-performing assets and tangible [equity](../e/equity.md), leading to inconsistencies when comparing Texas Ratios across different banks.

## Practical Example

Consider the financial data for XYZ [Bank](../b/bank.md):

- Non-performing assets (NPAs): $500 million
- Tangible [equity](../e/equity.md): $300 million
- [Loan](../l/loan.md) loss reserves: $200 million

Using the Texas Ratio formula:

\[ \text{Texas Ratio} = \frac{\$500 \, \text{million}}{\$300 \, \text{million} + \$200 \, \text{million}} = \frac{\$500 \, \text{million}}{\$500 \, \text{million}} = 1 \text{ (or 100%)} \]

In this example, XYZ [Bank](../b/bank.md) has a Texas Ratio of 1 (or 100%), indicating that the [bank](../b/bank.md)'s non-performing assets are exactly covered by its tangible [equity](../e/equity.md) and [loan](../l/loan.md) loss reserves. This signals a precarious financial standing where the [bank](../b/bank.md) has just enough resources to cover potential losses from its NPAs.

## Conclusion

The Texas Ratio remains an essential tool in the field of banking and [finance](../f/finance.md) for assessing the health of banks' [loan](../l/loan.md) portfolios and their ability to withstand potential [loan](../l/loan.md) losses. Despite its limitations, the Texas Ratio provides crucial insights into the [risk](../r/risk.md) and stability of financial institutions, especially valuable for investors, [bank](../b/bank.md) management, and regulators alike.

# Triangle

The triangle is one of the classic [chart patterns](../c/chart_patterns.md) used in [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) within the realm of trading and [finance](../f/finance.md). This pattern represents a period of [consolidation](../c/consolidation.md) in a trending [market](../m/market.md) followed by a [breakout](../b/breakout.md), which traders seek to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on. Triangles are classified into three main types: ascending triangles, descending triangles, and symmetrical triangles. Each type has its unique implications for traders and requires specific [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) for effective utilization.

## Ascending Triangle

The [ascending triangle](../a/ascending_triangle.md) pattern is considered bullish and often appears in an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md). It consists of a horizontal resistance line at the top and an upward-sloping support line at the bottom:
- **Resistance Line:** This is a level where the price faces substantial selling pressure and cannot rise above it.
- **Support Line:** An ascending line that indicates the lows are increasing over time.

### Characteristics:
1. **[Price Action](../p/price_action.md):** The price repeatedly tests the resistance level but fails to break above it while making higher lows.
2. **[Volume](../v/volume.md):** Typically, [volume](../v/volume.md) decreases as the pattern progresses and then spikes upon [breakout](../b/breakout.md).
3. **[Breakout](../b/breakout.md):** The pattern is confirmed when the price breaks above the resistance line with high [volume](../v/volume.md).

### Trading Strategy:
1. **Entry Point:** Enter a long position when the price closes above the resistance line with substantial [volume](../v/volume.md).
2. **Stop-Loss:** Place a [stop-loss order](../s/stop-loss_order.md) below the last low before the [breakout](../b/breakout.md).
3. **[Profit](../p/profit.md) Target:** The potential [profit](../p/profit.md) target is often calculated by measuring the height of the triangle and projecting it from the [breakout](../b/breakout.md) point.

## Descending Triangle

The [descending triangle](../d/descending_triangle.md) pattern is typically bearish and usually forms during downtrends. It features a horizontal support line at the bottom and a downward-sloping resistance line at the top:
- **Support Line:** This is a level where the price consistently finds buying [interest](../i/interest.md) but fails to drop below it.
- **Resistance Line:** A descending line that indicates the highs are decreasing over time.

### Characteristics:
1. **[Price Action](../p/price_action.md):** The price repeatedly tests the support level but fails to break below it while making lower highs.
2. **[Volume](../v/volume.md):** [Volume](../v/volume.md) usually diminishes through the formation and increases upon [breakout](../b/breakout.md).
3. **[Breakout](../b/breakout.md):** The pattern is confirmed when the price breaks below the support line with high [volume](../v/volume.md).

### Trading Strategy:
1. **Entry Point:** Enter a short position when the price closes below the support line with increased [volume](../v/volume.md).
2. **Stop-Loss:** Place a [stop-loss order](../s/stop-loss_order.md) above the last high before the [breakout](../b/breakout.md).
3. **[Profit](../p/profit.md) Target:** The potential [profit](../p/profit.md) target is often derived from the height of the triangle projected from the [breakout](../b/breakout.md) point.

## Symmetrical Triangle

The symmetrical triangle pattern can be seen as a continuation pattern and appears in both uptrends and downtrends. It is characterized by converging trendlines where both the resistance line slopes downwards and the support line slopes upwards:
- **Resistance Line:** A downward-sloping line representing lower highs.
- **Support Line:** An upward-sloping line representing higher lows.

### Characteristics:
1. **[Price Action](../p/price_action.md):** The price continues to make lower highs and higher lows, consolidating within a narrowing [range](../r/range.md).
2. **[Volume](../v/volume.md):** [Volume](../v/volume.md) typically decreases as the pattern progresses and increases at [breakout](../b/breakout.md).
3. **[Breakout](../b/breakout.md):** A [breakout](../b/breakout.md) can occur in either direction, making it [neutral](../n/neutral.md) until the [breakout](../b/breakout.md) direction is confirmed.

### Trading Strategy:
1. **Entry Point:** Enter a position (long or short) when the price breaks above the resistance line or below the support line with significant [volume](../v/volume.md).
2. **Stop-Loss:** Place a stop-loss above or below the last swing before the [breakout](../b/breakout.md).
3. **[Profit](../p/profit.md) Target:** The projected move is typically estimated by measuring the height of the triangle and applying it to the point of [breakout](../b/breakout.md).

## Importance of Volume in Triangles

[Volume](../v/volume.md) is a critical [factor](../f/factor.md) in confirming the [breakout](../b/breakout.md) of a triangle pattern. In low-[volume](../v/volume.md) environments, false breakouts are more likely to occur, leading to potential losses. A surging [volume](../v/volume.md) typically validates the [breakout](../b/breakout.md) and provides confidence in the [trend](../t/trend.md) continuation or [reversal](../r/reversal.md).

## Practical Application

### Live Trading Example

Consider a stock that has exhibited an [ascending triangle](../a/ascending_triangle.md) pattern over three months. The stock has continuously tested a resistance level of $150 but has failed to break above it. Meanwhile, the lows are rising, indicating a strong buying sentiment. As the price approaches the apex of the triangle, the [volume](../v/volume.md) starts decreasing. Then, a sudden spike in [volume](../v/volume.md) occurs, and the stock price breaches the $150 resistance level, closing at $152.

### Steps for Traders:
1. **Entry:** A [trader](../t/trader.md) enters a long position at the close price of $152.
2. **Stop-Loss:** The stop-loss is set at $140, underneath the most recent higher low.
3. **[Profit](../p/profit.md) Target:** The height of the triangle (difference between the highest and lowest points) is $20. Therefore, the [trader](../t/trader.md) sets a [profit](../p/profit.md) target at $170.

## Conclusion

[Chart patterns](../c/chart_patterns.md) like triangles are invaluable tools for traders. Understanding and efficiently using these patterns can significantly enhance the probability of successful trades. However, it's crucial to apply triangles in conjunction with other [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicator.md) and [market](../m/market.md) analysis to formulate a [robust](../r/robust.md) [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md).

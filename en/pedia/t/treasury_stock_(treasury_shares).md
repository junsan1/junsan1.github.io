# Treasury Stock (Treasury Shares)

Treasury stock, also known as treasury [shares](../s/shares.md) or reacquired stock, refers to [shares](../s/shares.md) that were once part of the outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md) of a company but were subsequently repurchased or otherwise reacquired by the issuing company. These [shares](../s/shares.md) are not considered when calculating dividends or [earnings](../e/earnings.md) per share (EPS), and they do not carry voting rights. Treasury stock is a crucial component of [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md) and has significant impacts on a company's [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) and overall strategy.

## Definition and Characteristics

### Definition

Treasury stock represents [shares](../s/shares.md) that a company has issued and subsequently bought back from shareholders. These [shares](../s/shares.md) can be reissued or retired. The stock [buyback](../b/buyback.md) can occur through various methods, including [open market](../o/open_market.md) purchases, [tender](../t/tender.md) offers, or negotiated transactions.

### Characteristics

1. **Non-Voting**: Treasury [shares](../s/shares.md) do not have any voting rights. This means they do not participate in [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) votes, including the election of the board of directors and other major corporate decisions.
   
2. **No Dividends**: Companies do not pay dividends on treasury stock. As these [shares](../s/shares.md) are not part of the outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md), they are excluded when calculating dividends.

3. **Reissuance**: Treasury stock can be reissued to the [market](../m/market.md) through secondary offerings or used for employees' stock [options](../o/options.md) and other corporate purposes.

4. **[Balance Sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) Impact**: Treasury stock is recorded under shareholders' [equity](../e/equity.md) on the company's [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md). It is usually [listed](../l/listed.md) as a negative number since it represents a reduction in [equity](../e/equity.md).

## Methods of Acquisition

### Open Market Purchases

In this scenario, a company buys back its [shares](../s/shares.md) through the [open market](../o/open_market.md) at prevailing [market](../m/market.md) prices. This method provides flexibility as the company can time purchases to take advantage of [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

### Tender Offers

A [tender offer](../t/tender_offer.md) involves the company [offering](../o/offering.md) to buy back [shares](../s/shares.md) from current shareholders at a specified price, usually at a [premium](../p/premium.md) over the current [market price](../m/market_price.md). Shareholders can choose to sell their [shares](../s/shares.md) back to the company at this price.

### Private Negotiations

Sometimes, companies repurchase [shares](../s/shares.md) through privately negotiated transactions with major shareholders or institutional investors. This method is less common but allows for tailored arrangements.

## Reasons for Repurchase

### Enhancing Shareholder Value

By reducing the number of outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md), [earnings](../e/earnings.md) per share (EPS) can increase, making the stock more attractive to investors. This could potentially elevate the stock's [market price](../m/market_price.md).

### Optimizing Capital Structure

Firms may buy back [shares](../s/shares.md) to adjust their [capital structure](../c/capital_structure.md). Reducing [equity](../e/equity.md) can increase a company's [debt](../d/debt.md)-to-[equity](../e/equity.md) ratio, which may be beneficial for optimizing the [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md).

### Employee Compensation Plans

Companies frequently use treasury [shares](../s/shares.md) for employee stock [options](../o/options.md), [restricted stock](../r/restricted_stock.md) units (RSUs), and other compensation plans. This helps in rewarding and retaining talent without issuing new [shares](../s/shares.md) and diluting existing ownership.

### Defensive Measures

Share repurchases can be employed as a defense mechanism against hostile takeovers. By reducing the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) available, it becomes more difficult for an entity to acquire a controlling stake in the company.

## Accounting for Treasury Stock

### Cost Method

Under the cost method, the price paid for the repurchase is recorded as a [debit](../d/debit.md) to the treasury stock account and a [credit](../c/credit.md) to cash. When sold again, the proceeds are credited, and the difference between the [sale](../s/sale.md) price and the repurchase price affects the [paid-in capital](../p/paid-in_capital.md) or [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md).

### Par Value Method

The [par value](../p/par_value.md) method involves recording the repurchase at the share's [par value](../p/par_value.md), with any additional amount going to [paid-in capital](../p/paid-in_capital.md) and the cash account being credited. This method is less common but can be used under certain [accounting](../a/accounting.md) frameworks.

## Regulatory Environment

Companies must adhere to various regulations and disclosed requirements. For instance, in the U.S., companies must comply with SEC rules and provide detailed disclosures regarding their treasury stock transactions in their [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md).

## Financial Statement Implications

Treasury stock impacts several key financial metrics:

- **Shareholders' [Equity](../e/equity.md)**: Treasury stock is reported as a contra [equity](../e/equity.md) account, reducing total shareholders' [equity](../e/equity.md).
- **[Earnings](../e/earnings.md) Per Share (EPS)**: Since treasury stock reduces the number of outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md), it generally results in higher EPS.
- **[Return](../r/return.md) on [Equity](../e/equity.md) (ROE)**: By lowering shareholders' [equity](../e/equity.md), a [buyback](../b/buyback.md) can increase ROE, making the company appear more efficient in generating profits from its [equity](../e/equity.md) base.

## Strategic Considerations

### Market Perception

[Share buybacks](../s/share_buybacks.md) can signal management's confidence in the company's future prospects. However, excessive repurchases might lead to skepticism if investors believe that the company has no better investment opportunities.

### Financial Health

Buybacks should be carefully weighed against the company's [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) needs and [debt](../d/debt.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md). Over-leveraging to [finance](../f/finance.md) buybacks can strain the company's [financial health](../f/financial_health.md).

### Opportunity Cost

Repurchasing [shares](../s/shares.md) diverts funds from other potential investments, such as R&D, acquisitions, or [capital](../c/capital.md) expenditures. Companies need to evaluate whether buybacks provide the best [return](../r/return.md) on investment compared to these alternatives.

## Real-World Examples

### Apple Inc.

Apple Inc. (https://www.apple.com/) is renowned for its extensive [share repurchase](../s/share_repurchase.md) programs. Over the years, Apple has returned billions of dollars to shareholders through buybacks, significantly impacting its EPS and stock price.

### Microsoft Corporation

Microsoft [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) (https://www.microsoft.com/) has also engaged in substantial [share repurchase](../s/share_repurchase.md) activities, helping to boost its EPS and provide returns to shareholders.

### ExxonMobil

ExxonMobil (https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/) has periodically engaged in [share buybacks](../s/share_buybacks.md), driven by its [capital allocation](../c/capital_allocation.md) strategy to [return](../r/return.md) [surplus](../s/surplus.md) cash to shareholders.

## Conclusion

Treasury stock is a powerful financial tool that companies use to manage their [capital structure](../c/capital_structure.md), [return](../r/return.md) [value](../v/value.md) to shareholders, and pursue other strategic objectives. Understanding its implications on [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) and corporate strategy is crucial for investors, regulators, and company management alike. By carefully weighing the benefits and risks associated with stock repurchases, companies can utilize treasury stock effectively to enhance overall [shareholder value](../s/shareholder_value.md).

# Twenty Eight Thirty Six Rule (28/36 Rule)

The 28/36 Rule is a well-known guideline in [personal finance](../p/personal_finance_in_trading.md), particularly in the context of [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) lending. This rule helps individuals and lenders gauge how much [debt](../d/debt.md), particularly in terms of a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md), a borrower can reasonably afford. The rule stipulates that a household should spend no more than 28% of its gross monthly [income](../i/income.md) on housing expenses and no more than 36% on total [debt service](../d/debt_service.md), including housing and other debts such as auto loans, student loans, and [credit](../c/credit.md) cards.

## Origin and Concept

The 28/36 Rule is not a law but rather a [rule of thumb](../r/rule_of_thumb.md) that has developed over time as a practical guideline for both lenders and prospective [home](../h/home.md) buyers. It originated from [conventional mortgage](../c/conventional_mortgage.md) [underwriting standards](../u/underwriting_standards.md) used by financial institutions to assess the [risk](../r/risk.md) of extending [credit](../c/credit.md) to potential borrowers.

The rationale behind the 28/36 Rule is quite straightforward; it aims to prevent borrowers from becoming overburdened with [debt](../d/debt.md), thereby reducing the likelihood of defaults and [financial distress](../f/financial_distress.md). By adhering to this rule, lenders can ensure that borrowers have enough [disposable income](../d/disposable_income.md) to cover other essential living expenses and to weather financial emergencies.

## Detailed Breakdown

### Housing Expense Ratio: 28%

The [housing expense ratio](../h/housing_expense_ratio.md), also known as the front-end ratio, limits the percentage of a borrower’s gross monthly [income](../i/income.md) that should go toward housing expenses. These expenses typically include:

- **[Principal](../p/principal.md) and [Interest](../i/interest.md) (P&I)**: The main components of a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [payment](../p/payment.md).
- **Property [Taxes](../t/taxes.md)**: [Taxes](../t/taxes.md) levied on the property by the local government.
- **[Homeowners Insurance](../h/homeowners_insurance.md)**: [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) that protects against various risks such as fire, theft, and other hazards.
- **Private [Mortgage Insurance](../m/mortgage_insurance.md) (PMI)**: For borrowers who put down less than 20% of the purchase price, this [insurance](../i/insurance.md) protects the [lender](../l/lender.md) in case of [default](../d/default.md).
- **Homeowners Association (HOA) Fees**: Fees applicable in certain housing communities.

To calculate the [housing expense ratio](../h/housing_expense_ratio.md), use the following formula:

\[ \text{[Housing Expense Ratio](../h/housing_expense_ratio.md)} = \frac{\text{Total Monthly Housing Expenses}}{\text{Gross Monthly [Income](../i/income.md)}} \times 100 \]

The result should be 28% or less according to the 28/36 Rule.

### Debt-to-Income Ratio: 36%

The [debt](../d/debt.md)-to-[income](../i/income.md) ratio, also known as the [back-end ratio](../b/back-end_ratio.md), expands on the front-end ratio by including all forms of [debt](../d/debt.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md). In addition to the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-related expenses noted above, this ratio considers:

- **Auto Loans**: Regular payments made toward any financed vehicles.
- **Student Loans**: Monthly installments paid on education loans.
- **[Credit Card](../c/credit_card.md) Payments**: Minimum payments required on [revolving credit](../r/revolving_credit.md) accounts.
- **Personal Loans**: Installment payments on any personal loans.

The formula for the [debt](../d/debt.md)-to-[income](../i/income.md) ratio is as follows:

\[ \text{Debt-to-[Income](../i/income.md) Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Monthly [Debt](../d/debt.md) Payments}}{\text{Gross Monthly [Income](../i/income.md)}} \times 100 \]

The 28/36 Rule advises that this ratio should not exceed 36%.

## Practical Application

### For Lenders

Lenders use the 28/36 Rule as part of their [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) process to evaluate potential borrowers. This rule helps them determine whether an applicant has the financial capacity to repay the [loan](../l/loan.md). Adherence to these ratios reduces the [risk](../r/risk.md) of [default](../d/default.md), making it a key element in responsible lending practices.

### For Borrowers

Prospective homebuyers can use the 28/36 Rule as a self-assessment tool to gauge their financial readiness for homeownership. By ensuring their housing expenses and total [debt](../d/debt.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md) fall within these limits, individuals can make more informed decisions about how much house they can afford without compromising their overall financial well-being.

## Limitations and Criticisms

While the 28/36 Rule is a useful guideline, it is not without its limitations:

- **[Variability](../v/variability.md) in Living Costs**: The rule doesn’t account for the significant variations in living costs in different regions. For instance, housing costs in urban areas may be much higher than in rural areas.
- **Individual Financial Situations**: The rule is a one-size-fits-all guideline and doesn’t consider individual financial circumstances, such as existing [wealth](../w/wealth.md), savings, or future [income](../i/income.md) potential.
- **[Market](../m/market.md) Conditions**: Fluctuations in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) markets can impact the applicability of the rule. What might be considered affordable under stable [market](../m/market.md) conditions may not [hold](../h/hold.md) true during a volatile period.

## Conclusion

Despite its limitations, the 28/36 Rule remains a valuable [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for both lenders and borrowers. It provides a clear, straightforward framework for assessing the affordability of housing and [debt](../d/debt.md) levels, contributing to more responsible financial decision-making. As with any financial guideline, it should be used in conjunction with other tools and considerations to make the most informed and prudent financial decisions.

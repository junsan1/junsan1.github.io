# Technical Job Skills

## Introduction

Technical job skills are specialized knowledge and competencies required to perform specific tasks related to a particular job or industry. These skills are often acquired through education, training, and hands-on experience. Unlike soft skills, which include traits like communication and teamwork, technical skills involve the use of tools, technologies, and methodologies to achieve desired outcomes. 

In the fields of trading and finance, technical job skills are crucial for analyzing financial data, executing trades, developing investment strategies, and managing portfolios.

# Total Return Calculation Methods

In the world of algorithmic trading, accurately calculating the total return of an investment is of paramount importance. The total return includes not only the capital appreciation or depreciation but also any income earned over the investment period, such as dividends or interest. Understanding how to properly calculate total return can help investors assess the performance of their strategies more accurately. This detailed exploration will cover the core concepts, methodologies, pros and cons, and practical applications of different total return calculation methods.

### 1. Simple Price Return

**Definition:**
The simple price return measures the percentage change in the price of an asset over a given time period. It does not take into account any income from dividends or interest.

**Formula:**
\[ \text{Price Return} = \frac{P_{\text{end}} - P_{\text{start}}}{P_{\text{start}}} \times 100 \]

- \(P_{\text{end}}\): The price of the asset at the end of the period.
- \(P_{\text{start}}\): The price of the asset at the start of the period.

**Example:**
If an asset is priced at $100 at the start and $120 at the end of the period, the price return is:
\[ \frac{120 - 100}{100} \times 100 = 20\% \]

**Pros:**
- Easy to calculate.
- Provides a clear percentage gain or loss.

**Cons:**
- Does not account for any dividend or interest income.
- Can be misleading for assets that provide significant income.

### 2. Total Return

**Definition:**
Total return calculates the overall return of an investment, including both price appreciation and income from dividends or interest. This provides a more comprehensive measure of performance.

**Formula:**
\[ \text{Total Return} = \frac{P_{\text{end}} - P_{\text{start}} + D}{P_{\text{start}}} \times 100 \]

- \(P_{\text{end}}\): The price of the asset at the end of the period.
- \(P_{\text{start}}\): The price of the asset at the start of the period.
- \(D\): The dividends or interest received during the period.

**Example:**
If an asset is priced at $100 at the start, $120 at the end, and pays $5 in dividends, the total return is:
\[ \frac{120 - 100 + 5}{100} \times 100 = 25\% \]

**Pros:**
- Comprehensive, incorporates all sources of return.
- Reflects true investment performance.

**Cons:**
- Slightly more complex to calculate.
- Requires accurate tracking of income received.

### 3. Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)

**Definition:**
CAGR is a useful method to average the annual return of an investment over multiple years, smoothening out fluctuations for a better long-term performance assessment.

**Formula:**
\[ \text{CAGR} = \left( \frac{P_{\text{end}}}{P_{\text{start}}}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}} - 1 \]

- \(P_{\text{end}}\): The price of the asset at the end of the period.
- \(P_{\text{start}}\): The price of the asset at the start of the period.
- \(n\): Number of years.

**Example:**
If an asset grows from $100 to $120 over three years, the CAGR is:
\[ \left( \frac{120}{100} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}} - 1 \approx 0.0632 \text{ or } 6.32\% \]

**Pros:**
- Smoothes out annual performance, useful for long-term investments.
- Facilitates comparison with other investments.

**Cons:**
- Does not reflect volatility or irregular returns.
- Requires a full multi-year period to apply.

### 4. Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

**Definition:**
IRR is the discount rate that makes the net present value (NPV) of all cash flows from an investment equal to zero, representing the annualized effective compounded return rate.

**Formula:**
\[ 0 = NPV = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{C_t}{(1+IRR)^t} \]

- \(C_t\): Cash flow at time \(t\).
- \(t\): Time period.
- \(IRR\): Internal rate of return.

**Example:**
If an investor outlays $1000 for an investment that returns $200 annually for three years and $1400 in the fourth year, IRR can be found through iterative methods or financial calculators.

**Pros:**
- Accounts for the timing of cash flows.
- Valuable for comparing projects with different cash flow patterns.

**Cons:**
- Complex to calculate manually.
- Potentially multiple IRRs for non-standard cash flows.

### 5. Money-Weighted Rate of Return

**Definition:**
The money-weighted rate of return (MWRR) is similar to the IRR but specifically measures the performance of an investment, accounting for contributions and withdrawals.

**Formula:**
\[ 0 = \sum_{t=1}^n \frac{C_t}{(1+MWRR)^t} \]

- \(C_t\): Cash flow at time \(t\).
- \(MWRR\): Money-weighted rate of return.

**Example:**
If an investor deposits an extra $500 into an investment after 1 year and withdraws $600 in the second year, the MWRR would be calculated considering these cash flows.

**Pros:**
- Adjusts for external cash flows.
- Gives a precise picture of investor's performance.

**Cons:**
- Requires detailed cash flow tracking.
- Complex to calculate compared to [time-weighted returns](../t/time-weighted_returns.md).

### 6. Time-Weighted Rate of Return (TWRR)

**Definition:**
TWRR measures the compound growth rate of $1 invested over time, eliminating the impacts of cash inflows and outflows.

**Formula:**
\[ \text{TWRR} = \left( \prod_{t=1}^n (1 + R_t) \right)^{\frac{1}{n}} - 1 \]

Where \(R_t\) is the return in each sub-period.

**Example:**
Given returns of 5%, 10%, and -3% over three periods, the TWRR is:
\[ \left( (1 + 0.05) \times (1 + 0.10) \times (1 - 0.03) \right)^{\frac{1}{3}} - 1 \approx 3.69\% \]

**Pros:**
- Eliminates the effects of cash flows.
- Essential for comparing investment managers.

**Cons:**
- Does not account for the actual size of cash flows.
- May differ significantly from investor experience.

### 7. Total Return Index (TRI)

**Definition:**
A Total Return Index (TRI) calculates the total return of an investment, including reinvested dividends, often used in constructing performance benchmarks.

**Formula:**
\[ \text{TRI}_{t} = \text{TRI}_{t-1} \times \left( 1 + \frac{\text{Price Return}}{100} + \frac{\text{Dividend Yield}}{100} \right) \]

- \(\text{TRI}_{t}\): Total Return Index at time \(t\).
- \(\text{Price Return}\): Price return of asset.
- \(\text{Dividend Yield}\): Dividend yield of asset.

**Example:**
If an index starts at 1000, with a price return of 2% and a dividend yield of 1%, the TRI at the next period is:
\[ 1000 \times \left( 1 + \frac{2}{100} + \frac{1}{100} \right) = 1030 \]

**Pros:**
- Comprehensive reflection of investment returns.
- Useful for [performance benchmarking](../p/performance_benchmarking.md).

**Cons:**
- Requires detailed data on dividends.
- Can be complex to implement broadly.

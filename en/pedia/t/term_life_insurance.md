# Term Life Insurance

Term [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) is a type of [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policy that provides coverage for a specified period or "term" of years. If the insured person dies within the time frame specified in the policy and the policy is active, or "in force," a [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) is paid out to the beneficiaries. Term [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) is typically the least expensive way to purchase a substantial [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) on a coverage amount per [premium](../p/premium.md) dollar [basis](../b/basis.md).

## Key Features of Term Life Insurance

### Policy Term
The "term" in term [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) refers to the period during which the coverage is active, commonly ranging from 10 to 30 years. The most common durations are 10, 20, and 30 years. Some policies may also [offer](../o/offer.md) shorter terms, such as 5 years, or longer terms, such as 35 or 40 years.

### Death Benefit
The [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) is the amount of [money](../m/money.md) that [will](../w/will.md) be paid to the beneficiaries upon the death of the insured, provided the policy is still active. This amount is set at the time of policy inception and is generally not subject to change throughout the term.

### Premiums
Premiums for term [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) are generally fixed for the term [duration](../d/duration.md) of the policy, meaning they do not increase or decrease over time. These premiums are typically lower than those of [permanent life insurance](../p/permanent_life_insurance.md) policies, making term [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) an attractive option for individuals seeking high coverage amounts at lower costs.

### Renewal and Conversion
Some term [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policies come with renewal [options](../o/options.md), allowing the policyholder to renew the coverage for another term without undergoing a medical exam, although the premiums for the renewal term usually increase. Additionally, many term policies [offer](../o/offer.md) a conversion option, which allows the policyholder to convert the term policy into a [permanent life insurance](../p/permanent_life_insurance.md) policy without a medical examination, though the premiums for the new permanent policy [will](../w/will.md) be higher.

## Types of Term Life Insurance

### Level Term Insurance
Level term [insurance](../i/insurance.md) provides coverage for a fixed period at a fixed [premium](../p/premium.md) rate. Both the [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) and the [premium](../p/premium.md) remain [unchanged](../u/unchanged.md) throughout the policy term. 

### Decreasing Term Insurance
[Decreasing term insurance](../d/decreasing_term_insurance.md) features a [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) that decreases over the policy term, usually in a predetermined manner, such as annually. The [premium](../p/premium.md) often remains level, making this less expensive initially, but the coverage amount reduces over time. This type is often used for coverage that coincides with a [debt](../d/debt.md) that decreases over time, such as a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md).

### Increasing Term Insurance
Unlike [decreasing term insurance](../d/decreasing_term_insurance.md), increasing term [insurance](../i/insurance.md) features a [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) that increases over time. This type can be structured to combat [inflation](../i/inflation.md) or rising financial [obligations](../o/obligation.md). The premiums typically increase along with the [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md).

### Return of Premium (ROP) Term Insurance
[Return](../r/return.md) of [Premium](../p/premium.md) (ROP) term [insurance](../i/insurance.md) returns the premiums paid if the insured outlives the policy term. Due to this feature, ROP policies have higher premiums compared to standard term [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policies, but they provide a savings mechanism if the insured does not pass away during the term.

## Advantages of Term Life Insurance

- **Affordability**: Typically, term [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) has lower premiums compared to [permanent life insurance](../p/permanent_life_insurance.md), making it more affordable for individuals seeking substantial coverage at a lower cost.

- **Flexibility**: With [options](../o/options.md) to choose the length of term and coverage amount, term [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) can be tailored to meet various [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md) needs.

## Disadvantages of Term Life Insurance

- **Limited [Duration](../d/duration.md)**: Coverage is limited to the policy term. Once the term ends, coverage stops unless renewed or converted.
- **No Cash [Value](../v/value.md)**: Term [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policies do not accumulate cash [value](../v/value.md) like [permanent life insurance](../p/permanent_life_insurance.md) policies, which means there's no investment component.

## When to Consider Term Life Insurance

- **[Income](../i/income.md) Replacement**: Ideal for families who want to ensure that their [income](../i/income.md) is replaced in the event of the policyholder's death.
- **[Debt](../d/debt.md) Coverage**: Suitable for covering debts that [will](../w/will.md) be paid off within a set period, such as a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) or personal [loan](../l/loan.md).
- **Temporary Protection**: Appropriate when financial needs are temporary and aligned with specific time frames.

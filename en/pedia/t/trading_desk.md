# Trading Desk

A trading desk is a centralized area where financial securities are bought and sold. This function is critical in both [buy-side](../b/buy-side.md) and [sell-side](../s/sell-side.md) firms and facilitates the transition of financial instruments between parties. Generally, trading desks exist within financial institutions, such as banks, [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds, pension funds, mutual funds, and [proprietary trading](../p/proprietary_trading.md) firms. Their primary purpose is to execute large [volume](../v/volume.md) trades efficiently and to minimize [market](../m/market.md) impact.

## Functionality and Role

### Buy-Side Trading Desk

On the [buy-side](../b/buy-side.md), trading desks [handle](../h/handle.md) the purchase and [sale](../s/sale.md) of assets on behalf of clients. This could include institutional investors, such as pension funds or mutual funds, that manage large portfolios of assets. The traders working at these desks are responsible for executing orders as efficiently and cost-effectively as possible, often leveraging relationships with [sell-side](../s/sell-side.md) firms to achieve better pricing and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).

### Sell-Side Trading Desk

On the [sell-side](../s/sell-side.md), trading desks are often within [investment banks](../i/investment_bank_(ib).md) and brokerage firms. These desks provide [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) to the [market](../m/market.md) by facilitating trades for their clients, including retail investors and institutional investors. They often deal with [market](../m/market.md) making, maintaining an [inventory](../i/inventory.md) of securities to buy and sell, providing quotes, and managing [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Types of Trading Desks

Depending on the types of financial instruments they specialize in, trading desks can be categorized into:

1. **Equities Trading Desk**: Deals with company [stocks](../s/stock.md).
2. **[Fixed Income](../f/fixed_income.md) Trading Desk**: Focuses on bonds and other [debt](../d/debt.md) instruments.

5. **[Derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) Trading Desk**: Trades in [financial derivatives](../f/financial_derivatives.md) like [options](../o/options.md), [futures](../f/futures.md), and swaps.

Each desk requires specialized knowledge and tools to function effectively. Traders often use advanced [software platforms](../s/software_platforms_for_trading.md) to analyze [market](../m/market.md) trends, execute orders, and manage [risk](../r/risk.md).

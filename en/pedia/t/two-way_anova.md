# Two-Way ANOVA

Two-Way Analysis of Variance (Two-Way ANOVA) is a statistical technique used to examine the influence of two different categorical independent variables on one continuous dependent variable. This method helps in understanding whether there is an interaction effect between the two independent variables on the dependent variable. It's essential for researchers and data analysts who need to experiment and analyze the effects of two factors simultaneously.

## Basic Concept of ANOVA

ANOVA, or Analysis of Variance, is a collection of statistical models used to analyze the differences among group means and their associated procedures. The simplest form, One-Way ANOVA, examines the influence of a single [factor](../f/factor.md), while Two-Way ANOVA adds complexity by incorporating two factors at two levels of interaction.

## The Structure of Two-Way ANOVA

### Factors and Levels

- **Factors**: Independent variables being examined. For Two-Way ANOVA, we have two factors.
- **Levels**: Different groups or categories within each [factor](../f/factor.md).

For instance, if we are studying the effects of teaching methods ([Factor](../f/factor.md) A) and learning environments ([Factor](../f/factor.md) B) on student performance (dependent variable), "teaching methods" and "learning environments" are the factors, and if each has, say, three different types (like different teaching techniques and varied learning environments), they represent the levels.

### Interaction

Two-Way ANOVA not only helps determine the individual main effects of each [factor](../f/factor.md) but also investigates whether thereâ€™s an interaction effect between them. An interaction effect means the effect of one [factor](../f/factor.md) depends on the level of the other [factor](../f/factor.md).

## Performing Two-Way ANOVA

Performing a Two-Way ANOVA involves several steps:

1. **Formulate Hypotheses**:
   - **[Null Hypothesis](../n/null_hypothesis.md) (H0)**: Assumes no effect/interaction.
   - **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: Assumes some effect or interaction.

2. **Calculate [Sum of Squares](../s/sum_of_squares.md)**:
   - **Between-Groups SS**: [Variability](../v/variability.md) attributed to factors.
   - **Within-Groups SS**: [Variability](../v/variability.md) within each group itself.
   - **Interaction SS**: [Variability](../v/variability.md) due to interactions.

3. **[Degrees of Freedom](../d/degrees_of_freedom.md) (df)**:
   - Calculated for each source of variation ([factor](../f/factor.md) A, [factor](../f/factor.md) B, interaction, error).

4. **Mean Squares (MS)**:
   - Obtained by dividing the [sum of squares](../s/sum_of_squares.md) by their respective [degrees of freedom](../d/degrees_of_freedom.md).

5. **F-Ratios**:
   - Calculate F-ratios for both main effects and the interaction effect.

6. **ANOVA Table**:
   - Summarizes the results, presenting sources of variation, [degrees of freedom](../d/degrees_of_freedom.md), [sum of squares](../s/sum_of_squares.md), mean squares, F-ratios, and p-values.

7. **Post Hoc Tests**:
   - Conducted if the ANOVA is significant, to determine which specific groups differ.

## Assumptions in Two-Way ANOVA

1. **Independence of Observations**: Each subject or data point is independent of the others.
2. **Normality**: The dependent variable should be approximately normally distributed within each group.
3. **Homogeneity of Variances**: Similar variances across the groups.

## Interpretation of Results

### Main Effects

- **Main Effect of [Factor](../f/factor.md) A**: Examines if the different levels of [Factor](../f/factor.md) A result in significant changes in the dependent variable.
- **Main Effect of [Factor](../f/factor.md) B**: Examines if the different levels of [Factor](../f/factor.md) B result in significant changes in the dependent variable.

### Interaction Effect

- An interaction effect shows that the difference in the dependent variable for levels of one [factor](../f/factor.md) varies depending on the level of the second [factor](../f/factor.md).

## Practical Applications

Two-Way ANOVA finds applications in various fields:

- **Medical Research**: Studying the effects of medication type ([Factor](../f/factor.md) A) and dosage levels ([Factor](../f/factor.md) B) on patient recovery times.
- **[Market Research](../m/market_research.md)**: Analyzing the impact of advertising method ([Factor](../f/factor.md) A) and region ([Factor](../f/factor.md) B) on sales figures.
- **Agriculture**: Assessing the influence of fertilizer type ([Factor](../f/factor.md) A) and irrigation level ([Factor](../f/factor.md) B) on crop [yield](../y/yield.md).

## Example Calculation

Consider a practical example where researchers are interested in the effect of different diets ([Factor](../f/factor.md) A: Diets 1, 2, and 3) and [exercise](../e/exercise.md) regimes ([Factor](../f/factor.md) B: [Exercise](../e/exercise.md) A and [Exercise](../e/exercise.md) B) on weight loss.

### Hypotheses

- **H0A**: All diet groups have the same mean weight loss.
- **H0B**: All [exercise](../e/exercise.md) regimes have the same mean weight loss.
- **H0AB**: There is no interaction effect between diet and [exercise](../e/exercise.md) on weight loss.

### Data Collection

Participants are randomly assigned to each of the combinations of diets and [exercise](../e/exercise.md) regimes.

### ANOVA Table

An ANOVA table is prepared, and F-ratios are calculated. If F-ratios for the main effects and interaction effects are larger than the critical F-[value](../v/value.md), the null hypotheses are rejected, suggesting significant effects.

## Software for Two-Way ANOVA

Many statistical software programs can perform Two-Way ANOVA, including:

- **Python**: Using `statsmodels` and `scipy` libraries.
- **R**: The `aov` function.
- **SPSS**: Through the General Linear Model approach.
- **SAS**: Using the `PROC GLM` procedure.

For demonstration in Python:

```python
[import](../i/import.md) pandas as pd
[import](../i/import.md) statsmodels.api as sm
from statsmodels.formula.api [import](../i/import.md) ols

# Sample dataset
data = {
    'Diet': ['Diet1', 'Diet1', 'Diet2', 'Diet2', 'Diet3', 'Diet3', 'Diet1', 'Diet2', 'Diet3'],
    '[Exercise](../e/exercise.md)': ['ExerciseA', 'ExerciseB', 'ExerciseA', 'ExerciseB', 'ExerciseA', 'ExerciseB', 'ExerciseA', 'ExerciseA', 'ExerciseA'],
    'WeightLoss': [5, 7, 8, 6, 9, 8, 6, 7, 10]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Performing Two-Way ANOVA
model = ols('WeightLoss ~ C(Diet) + C([Exercise](../e/exercise.md)) + C(Diet):C([Exercise](../e/exercise.md))', data=df).fit()
anova_table = sm.stats.anova_lm(model, typ=2)

print(anova_table)
```

## Conclusion

Two-Way ANOVA is a powerful tool that helps in analyzing complex experimental designs involving two factors. It doesn't just stop at identifying single [factor](../f/factor.md) effects but delves into interaction effects, providing a deeper insight into the intricate relations among variables. Comprehending its methodology and assumptions enables accurate and meaningful interpretations in research and data analysis.

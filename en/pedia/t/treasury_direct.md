# Treasury Direct

TreasuryDirect is a platform operated by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service under the U.S. Department of the Treasury. It is designed to facilitate the purchase, management, and [redemption](../r/redemption.md) of U.S. government securities, including savings bonds, Treasury bills, notes, and bonds. It offers an online environment where individual investors can access these instruments directly from the government, bypassing the need for intermediaries such as brokers or financial advisors.

## Overview

Launched in 1986, TreasuryDirect has been developed to provide a convenient, efficient, and secure way for individuals to invest in government securities. The platform is a key component of the [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md)'s efforts to support a broad-based ownership of government [debt](../d/debt.md). Investors using TreasuryDirect benefit from lower costs, simplicity, and [transparency](../t/transparency.md) compared to traditional methods of investment.

## Types of Securities Available

### Savings Bonds

Savings bonds are non-[marketable securities](../m/marketable_securities.md), meaning they cannot be bought or sold in a [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md). TreasuryDirect offers two types of savings bonds:

- **Series EE Bonds**: Issued at [face value](../f/face_value.md) and guaranteed to double in [value](../v/value.md) over 20 years. [Interest](../i/interest.md) accrues monthly and is compounded semi-annually.
- **Series I Bonds**: Designed to protect against [inflation](../i/inflation.md), these bonds earn a combined fixed rate and an [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rate, which is adjusted semi-annually.

### Treasury Bills (T-Bills)

T-Bills are short-term securities maturing in one year or less. They are sold at a [discount](../d/discount.md) to [face value](../f/face_value.md), and the difference between the purchase price and the [face value](../f/face_value.md) is the [investor](../i/investor.md)’s [return](../r/return.md).

### Treasury Notes

[Treasury notes](../t/treasury_notes.md) are medium-term securities with maturities ranging from two to ten years. They pay [interest](../i/interest.md) semi-annually and [return](../r/return.md) the [face value](../f/face_value.md) upon [maturity](../m/maturity.md).

### Treasury Bonds

Treasury bonds are long-term securities with maturities of 20 years or more. Like notes, they pay [interest](../i/interest.md) semi-annually and [return](../r/return.md) the [face value](../f/face_value.md) upon [maturity](../m/maturity.md).

### Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)

TIPS are designed to protect against [inflation](../i/inflation.md). The [principal](../p/principal.md) [value](../v/value.md) of TIPS adjusts based on changes in the Consumer Price [Index](../i/index.md) (CPI). They [offer](../o/offer.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) payments twice a year, which fluctuate because the rate is applied to the adjusted [principal](../p/principal.md).

### Floating Rate Notes (FRNs)

FRNs have an [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) that resets periodically based on the [discount](../d/discount.md) rates of the most recent 13-week T-Bills. They provide some protection against rising [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and allow for a diversified fixed-[income](../i/income.md) portfolio.

## Features and Benefits

### Direct Purchase and Redemption

TreasuryDirect enables investors to purchase and redeem securities directly through the U.S. Department of the Treasury. By doing so, investors can avoid fees and commissions typically charged by brokers.

### Electronic Records

All transactions and account activities are documented electronically, which increases [security](../s/security.md) and reduces the need for physical documentation.

### Convenience and Accessibility

The platform is accessible 24/7 from any internet-connected device, allowing investors to manage their accounts, purchase securities, and monitor investments at their convenience.

### Security

TreasuryDirect employs advanced [security](../s/security.md) measures, including multifactor authentication, encryption, and secure servers, to protect users' sensitive information and transactions.

## Account Types

### Individual Accounts

These are the most common type of account used by individual investors to purchase and manage their Treasury securities.

### Entity Accounts

Entity accounts are designed for organizations, including corporations, trusts, estates, and partnerships. These accounts facilitate the management of securities held by entities rather than individuals.

### Minor Accounts

TreasuryDirect allows guardians to set up accounts for minors, enabling them to [hold](../h/hold.md) securities in the child’s name. This can be an effective way to save for future expenses, such as education.

## How to Get Started

### Setting Up an Account

To [open](../o/open.md) a TreasuryDirect account, investors must:
1. Visit the TreasuryDirect website at [www.treasurydirect.gov](http://www.treasurydirect.gov).
2. Provide personal information, including [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) Number (SSN) and banking details.
3. Create a username and password.
4. Complete additional [security](../s/security.md) questions.

### Funding the Account

Investors can link their TreasuryDirect account to their [bank](../b/bank.md) accounts for easy [fund](../f/fund.md) transfers. Purchases are made directly through these linked accounts.

### Purchasing Securities

Once the account is set up and funded, investors can log in and select the type of [security](../s/security.md) they wish to purchase. They have the flexibility to schedule recurring purchases or make one-time transactions.

## Tax Considerations

### Interest Income

The [interest](../i/interest.md) earned on [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) securities is subject to [federal income](../f/federal_income.md) tax but is exempt from state and local [taxes](../t/taxes.md). This [tax benefit](../t/tax_benefit.md) can be particularly advantageous for investors residing in high-tax states.

### Savings Bonds

[Interest](../i/interest.md) on savings bonds can be either reported annually or deferred until the [bond](../b/bond.md) is redeemed. Additionally, savings [bond](../b/bond.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) may be tax-exempt when used for qualified educational expenses, under specific conditions.

## Tips for Investors

1. **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: It's important to consider how Treasury securities fit into an overall [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md). While they are low-[risk](../r/risk.md), they should [complement](../c/complement.md) other [asset](../a/asset.md) classes to balance the portfolio.
2. **[Interest Rate](../i/interest_rate.md) Environment**: Be mindful of the prevailing [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) environment. For instance, TIPS may be more appealing during periods of rising [inflation](../i/inflation.md), while fixed-rate securities could be a better choice in stable rate conditions.
3. **[Laddering](../l/laddering.md)**: Consider creating a [bond ladder](../b/bond_ladder.md) by purchasing securities with varying maturities. This can help manage [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md) and provide a steady stream of cash flows.

## Conclusion

TreasuryDirect offers a streamlined and compelling way for investors to participate in the [market](../m/market.md) for U.S. government securities. With its ease of use, cost advantages, and [robust](../r/robust.md) [security](../s/security.md) features, it is an attractive option for those looking to invest in low-[risk](../r/risk.md), government-backed instruments. By understanding the various types of securities available and the features of the TreasuryDirect platform, investors can make informed decisions tailored to their financial goals.

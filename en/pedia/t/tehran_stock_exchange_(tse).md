# Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE)

## Introduction

The Tehran Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (TSE) is Iran's largest and most significant stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md), formally established in 1967. It is located in Tehran and plays a pivotal role in the country's [economy](../e/economy.md) by enabling companies to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) through stock issuance and providing a marketplace for investors to buy and sell securities.

## Historical Background

The concept of a stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md) in Iran dates back to the early 1930s, but it wasn't until 1966 that the necessary legal framework was established with the ratification of the Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) act. The TSE officially started its operations on February 4, 1967, initially included very few listings and was limited in activity. Over time, the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) grew both in terms of the number of [listed](../l/listed.md) companies and the [volume](../v/volume.md) of trades. The TSE faced significant challenges during the 1979 Islamic Revolution and the subsequent Iran-Iraq war but has continued to develop and expand its operations since then.

## Structure and Governance

### Organizational Structure

The TSE operates under a hierarchical [organizational structure](../o/organizational_structure.md) composed of several governing bodies:

# Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE)

## Introduction

The Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE) is Iran's largest and most significant stock exchange, formally established in 1967. It is located in Tehran and plays a pivotal role in the country's economy by enabling companies to raise capital through stock issuance and providing a marketplace for investors to buy and sell securities.

## Historical Background

The concept of a stock exchange in Iran dates back to the early 1930s, but it wasn't until 1966 that the necessary legal framework was established with the ratification of the Stock Exchange act. The TSE officially started its operations on February 4, 1967, initially included very few listings and was limited in activity. Over time, the exchange grew both in terms of the number of listed companies and the volume of trades. The TSE faced significant challenges during the 1979 Islamic Revolution and the subsequent Iran-Iraq war but has continued to develop and expand its operations since then.

## Structure and Governance

### Organizational Structure

The TSE operates under a hierarchical organizational structure composed of several governing bodies:

- **Assembly of Shareholders:** The highest authority that appoints the members of the board and other key positions.
- **Board of Directors:** Responsible for overall management and policy-making.
- **Managing Director:** The executive officer in charge of day-to-day operations.
- **Market Surveillance Department:** Ensures compliance with regulations and monitors trading activities.

### Regulatory Framework

The TSE operates under strict regulatory oversight designed to maintain market integrity, protect investors, and ensure transparency.

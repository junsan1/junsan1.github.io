# Treasury Inflation-Protected Security (TIPS)

Treasury [Inflation-Protected Securities](../i/inflation-protected_securities.md) (TIPS) are a type of [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) [security](../s/security.md) specifically designed to protect investors from [inflation](../i/inflation.md). The [principal](../p/principal.md) [value](../v/value.md) of TIPS increases with [inflation](../i/inflation.md) and decreases with [deflation](../d/deflation.md), as measured by the Consumer Price [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (CPI). Here, we [will](../w/will.md) delve into the fundamental aspects of TIPS, their benefits, how they work, and their significance in a diversified investment portfolio.

## What are TIPS?

Introduced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 1997, TIPS are government securities indexed to [inflation](../i/inflation.md). They are designed to provide a [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against [inflation](../i/inflation.md) [risk](../r/risk.md), as their [principal](../p/principal.md) [value](../v/value.md) adjusts in line with changing [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rates. The securities [offer](../o/offer.md) a [fixed interest rate](../f/fixed_interest_rate.md), but the actual [interest](../i/interest.md) payments can vary because they are applied to the adjusted [principal](../p/principal.md).

### Key Features of TIPS

1. **[Inflation](../i/inflation.md)-[Indexing](../i/indexing.md)**: TIPS are uniquely indexed to the Consumer Price [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (CPI). This means the [principal](../p/principal.md) [value](../v/value.md) of TIPS adjusts with [inflation](../i/inflation.md) or [deflation](../d/deflation.md).
2. **[Fixed Interest Rate](../f/fixed_interest_rate.md)**: While the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) remains constant, the amount paid in [interest](../i/interest.md) can vary because the [interest](../i/interest.md) is applied to the [inflation](../i/inflation.md)-adjusted [principal](../p/principal.md).
3. **[Maturity](../m/maturity.md) Terms**: TIPS are available in terms of 5, 10, and 30 years.
4. **Government-Backed**: Like other [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) securities, TIPS are considered one of the safest investments because they are backed by the full faith and [credit](../c/credit.md) of the U.S. government.

## How Do TIPS Work?

### Principal Adjustment

The [principal](../p/principal.md) of TIPS adjusts with [inflation](../i/inflation.md) as measured by the CPI. If [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rises, the [principal](../p/principal.md) increases, and conversely, if [deflation](../d/deflation.md) occurs, the [principal](../p/principal.md) decreases. This adjustment happens semiannually.

For example, if an [investor](../i/investor.md) holds a $1,000 TIPS and the CPI indicates a 2% [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rate, the [principal](../p/principal.md) [will](../w/will.md) be adjusted to $1,020 after one year.

### Interest Payments

The [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) on TIPS is fixed, but because it is applied to the [inflation](../i/inflation.md)-adjusted [principal](../p/principal.md), the [interest](../i/interest.md) payments can fluctuate. For instance, if the [fixed interest rate](../f/fixed_interest_rate.md) is 1% and the adjusted [principal](../p/principal.md) is $1,020, the annual [interest](../i/interest.md) [payment](../p/payment.md) would be $10.20 instead of the original $10 (based on the unadjusted $1,000 [principal](../p/principal.md)).

### Example Calculation

Let's break down a simplified example:

- Initial [Principal](../p/principal.md): $1,000
- TIPS [Fixed Interest Rate](../f/fixed_interest_rate.md): 1%
- [Inflation](../i/inflation.md) Rate (CPI Adjustment): 2%

After one year:
- New [Principal](../p/principal.md) = $1,000 * 1.02 = $1,020
- Annual [Interest](../i/interest.md) [Payment](../p/payment.md) = $1,020 * 0.01 = $10.20

Over time, as [inflation](../i/inflation.md) accumulates, the adjustments can significantly affect the [principal](../p/principal.md) and [interest](../i/interest.md) payments, safeguarding the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md).

## Benefits of Investing in TIPS

### Protection Against Inflation

The primary benefit of TIPS is their ability to protect against [inflation](../i/inflation.md). Since the [principal](../p/principal.md) is adjusted according to the CPI, TIPS ensure that the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) is maintained even in periods of rising [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

### Safety and Security

As [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) securities, TIPS are subject to the lowest [default risk](../d/default_risk.md). They are a highly secure [investment vehicle](../i/investment_vehicle.md), suitable for [risk-averse](../r/risk-averse.md) investors seeking stability.

### Diversification

Including TIPS in an investment portfolio can [offer](../o/offer.md) [diversification benefits](../d/diversification_benefits.md). They tend to exhibit different [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md) characteristics compared to [stocks](../s/stock.md) and conventional bonds, potentially improving the [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted returns of a portfolio.

### Tax Considerations

[Interest](../i/interest.md) [income](../i/income.md) and [principal](../p/principal.md) adjustments on TIPS are subject to federal tax but exempt from state and local [taxes](../t/taxes.md). However, the [inflation](../i/inflation.md) adjustment is taxed as [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md), which could result in a higher tax bill even if the [investor](../i/investor.md) does not sell the TIPS.

## TIPS Market and Trading

### Primary Market

Investors can buy TIPS directly from the [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) through TreasuryDirect, in primary auctions where the government issues new securities. The auction process allows investors to place competitive or non-competitive bids.

- **Non-competitive bids**: Investors agree to accept the [yield](../y/yield.md) determined at the auction, ensuring they receive the [security](../s/security.md).
- **Competitive bids**: Investors specify the [yield](../y/yield.md) they are willing to accept, and the bids with the lowest yields win.

### Secondary Market

TIPS can also be bought and sold in the [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md) through brokers and dealers. Prices in the [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md) fluctuate based on [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, [inflation](../i/inflation.md) expectations, and other economic factors.

### TIPS ETFs and Mutual Funds

For investors who prefer more [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and easier access to TIPS, [exchange](../e/exchange.md)-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds that specialize in TIPS are available. These funds allow investors to [gain](../g/gain.md) exposure to a diversified portfolio of TIPS without needing to purchase individual securities.

## Federal Reserve and TIPS

The Federal Reserve monitors [inflation](../i/inflation.md) and adjusts [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) to manage economic stability. TIPS provide valuable insights into [market](../m/market.md) expectations of [inflation](../i/inflation.md). The difference between the [yield](../y/yield.md) on [nominal](../n/nominal.md) Treasury bonds and TIPS, known as the breakeven [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rate, reflects the [market](../m/market.md)'s [inflation](../i/inflation.md) expectations. This metric helps the Federal Reserve in making informed policy decisions.

## Risks of Investing in TIPS

### Interest Rate Risk

Like other bonds, the prices of TIPS can decline if [interest](../i/interest.md) rates rise. Although TIPS provide [inflation](../i/inflation.md) protection, they are not immune to [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) fluctuations.

### Inflation Measurement

TIPS are indexed to the CPI, which might not perfectly reflect an individual [investor](../i/investor.md)'s personal [inflation](../i/inflation.md) experience. Therefore, there might be disparities between the CPI and the actual [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rate affecting an [investor](../i/investor.md).

### Tax Considerations

The semiannual [inflation](../i/inflation.md) adjustments to the [principal](../p/principal.md) are taxed as [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md), which can lead to a higher [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md) even if the [investor](../i/investor.md) has not sold the TIPS. This phenomenon is often called "phantom [income](../i/income.md)."

## How to Invest in TIPS

### Direct Purchases from TreasuryDirect

Investors can purchase TIPS directly from the U.S. government through the TreasuryDirect website. This method is beneficial for those who want to [hold](../h/hold.md) TIPS to [maturity](../m/maturity.md) and avoid brokerage fees.

### Brokerage Accounts

TIPS can also be purchased through brokerage accounts. This method provides more flexibility to buy and sell TIPS in the [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md).

### Mutual Funds and ETFs

[Investing](../i/investing.md) in mutual funds or ETFs that focus on TIPS can provide [diversification](../d/diversification.md) and easier management of investments. These funds manage a portfolio of TIPS on behalf of investors.

## Conclusion

Treasury [Inflation-Protected Securities](../i/inflation-protected_securities.md) (TIPS) [offer](../o/offer.md) a unique and valuable addition to an [investor](../i/investor.md)â€™s portfolio, providing essential protection against the eroding effects of [inflation](../i/inflation.md). By adjusting the [principal](../p/principal.md) [value](../v/value.md) with the changing [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rate, TIPS ensure that the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) remains intact. Their safety, backed by the U.S. government, along with their [inflation](../i/inflation.md)-protection characteristics, makes them an attractive option for [risk-averse](../r/risk-averse.md) investors and those seeking to diversify their investment portfolios.

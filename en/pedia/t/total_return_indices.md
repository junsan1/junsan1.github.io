# Total Return Indices

**Total Return Indices (TRI)** are financial indices that measure the performance of a group of assets, such as stocks, bonds, or other investment vehicles, including both price changes and income generated from dividends or interest payments. They present a more comprehensive perspective of investment returns compared to price indices, which only consider the price changes of the assets.

## Components and Calculation

### Price Change
At the core of any financial index is the measurement of price movements of the included assets. This component reflects the appreciation or depreciation in the value of each asset over time. 

#### Calculation Formula
For an individual asset:
```math
Price Change = (Price at End of Period - Price at Start of Period) / Price at Start of Period
```

For an index with multiple assets:
```math
Index Price Change = Σ (Weight of Asset * Price Change of Asset)
```

### Income (Dividends/Interest)
TRIs include income generated from the assets in the form of dividends (for stocks) or interest (for bonds and other debt instruments).

#### Calculation
For stock indices, dividends per share are included.
For bond indices, it is often calculated as:
```math
Income = Σ (Interest Payments or Coupon Payments received)
```
This income in TRI is assumed to be reinvested into the index.

### Total Return Calculation
The combination of price changes and income yields the total return.
```math
Total Return = Price Change + Income
```

To track the performance continuously, daily total return values can be used.

### Example: S&P 500 Total Return Index (SPXTR)
One of the most cited TRIs is the S&P 500 Total Return Index. It incorporates dividends paid by the constituents of the S&P 500, assuming they are reinvested into the index.

## Importance and Applications

### Investor Incentives
1. **Holistic Performance Measurement**: TRIs provide a complete view of investment performance, considering both capital gains and income.
2. **Benchmarking**: They serve as benchmarks for mutual funds, ETFs, and institutional portfolios, allowing for accurate performance comparisons.
3. **Risk Adjusted Return Analysis**: Investors can better understand the risk and return profile of an investment strategy including income components.

### Derivatives and Structured Products
Total return indices are used as underlyings for various financial products like futures, options, and structured products.

## Types of Total Return Indices

### Equity TRIs
These include dividends from underlying stocks. Examples include:
- **MSCI World Total Return Index**: Tracks [global equities](../g/global_equities.md) including dividends.
- **FTSE 100 Total Return Index**: Considers UK stocks with reinvested dividends.

### Bond TRIs
These focus on fixed-income securities considering reinvested interest.
- **Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Total Return Index**

### Commodity TRIs
Total Return Commodity Indices take into account the price fluctuations and the collateral yield.
- **[Bloomberg](../b/bloomberg.md) Commodity Total Return Index**

## Factors Influencing Total Return Indices

### Dividend Policies
The amount and frequency of dividends by constituent companies impact the total returns.

### Tax Considerations
Taxes on dividends or interest impact the net income that can be reinvested.

### Market Conditions
[Economic cycles](../e/economic_cycles.md), interest rates, and market volatility impact the price changes and yields of assets included in TRIs.

## Benefits and Limitations

### Benefits
- **Comprehensive Performance Insight**: By considering both capital gains and income, TRIs provide a true picture of investment returns.
- **Better for Long-Term Analysis**: Suitable for long-term performance tracking where reinvesting income is a practice.

### Limitations
- **Complexity in Calculation**: Requires tracking dividends, interest, and their reinvestment, increasing complexity.
- **Variation Across Regions**: Different tax laws and market practices impact the comparability of international TRIs.

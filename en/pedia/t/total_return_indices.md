# Total Return Indices

**[Total Return](../t/total_return.md) Indices (TRI)** are financial indices that measure the performance of a group of assets, such as [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, or other investment vehicles, including both price changes and [income](../i/income.md) generated from dividends or [interest](../i/interest.md) payments. They present a more comprehensive perspective of investment returns compared to price indices, which only consider the price changes of the assets.

## Components and Calculation

### Price Change
At the core of any financial [index](../i/index_instrument.md) is the measurement of price movements of the included assets. This component reflects the appreciation or [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) in the [value](../v/value.md) of each [asset](../a/asset.md) over time. 

#### Calculation Formula
For an individual [asset](../a/asset.md):
```math
Price Change = (Price at End of Period - Price at Start of Period) / Price at Start of Period
```

For an [index](../i/index_instrument.md) with [multiple](../m/multiple.md) assets:
```math
[Index](../i/index_instrument.md) Price Change = Σ (Weight of [Asset](../a/asset.md) * Price Change of [Asset](../a/asset.md))
```

### Income (Dividends/Interest)
TRIs include [income](../i/income.md) generated from the assets in the form of dividends (for [stocks](../s/stock.md)) or [interest](../i/interest.md) (for bonds and other [debt](../d/debt.md) instruments).

#### Calculation
For stock indices, dividends per share are included.
For [bond](../b/bond.md) indices, it is often calculated as:
```math
[Income](../i/income.md) = Σ ([Interest](../i/interest.md) Payments or Coupon Payments received)
```
This [income](../i/income.md) in TRI is assumed to be reinvested into the [index](../i/index_instrument.md).

### Total Return Calculation
The combination of price changes and [income](../i/income.md) yields the [total return](../t/total_return.md).
```math
[Total Return](../t/total_return.md) = Price Change + [Income](../i/income.md)
```

To track the performance continuously, daily [total return](../t/total_return.md) values can be used.

### Example: S&P 500 Total Return Index (SPXTR)
One of the most cited TRIs is the S&P 500 [Total Return Index](../t/total_return_index.md). It incorporates dividends paid by the constituents of the S&P 500, assuming they are reinvested into the [index](../i/index_instrument.md).

## Importance and Applications

### Investor Incentives
1. **Holistic Performance Measurement**: TRIs provide a complete view of investment performance, considering both [capital](../c/capital.md) gains and [income](../i/income.md).
2. **Benchmarking**: They serve as benchmarks for mutual funds, ETFs, and institutional portfolios, allowing for accurate performance comparisons.
3. **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Adjusted [Return](../r/return.md) Analysis**: Investors can better understand the [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md) profile of an [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) including [income](../i/income.md) components.

### Derivatives and Structured Products
[Total return](../t/total_return.md) indices are used as underlyings for various financial products like [futures](../f/futures.md), [options](../o/options.md), and structured products.

## Types of Total Return Indices

### Equity TRIs
These include dividends from [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md). Examples include:
- **MSCI World [Total Return Index](../t/total_return_index.md)**: Tracks [global equities](../g/global_equities.md) including dividends.
- **FTSE 100 [Total Return Index](../t/total_return_index.md)**: Considers UK [stocks](../s/stock.md) with reinvested dividends.

### Bond TRIs
These focus on fixed-[income](../i/income.md) securities considering reinvested [interest](../i/interest.md).
- **Barclays U.S. Aggregate [Bond](../b/bond.md) [Total Return Index](../t/total_return_index.md)**

### Commodity TRIs
[Total Return](../t/total_return.md) [Commodity](../c/commodity.md) Indices take into account the price fluctuations and the [collateral](../c/collateral.md) [yield](../y/yield.md).
- **[Bloomberg](../b/bloomberg.md) [Commodity](../c/commodity.md) [Total Return Index](../t/total_return_index.md)**

## Factors Influencing Total Return Indices

### Dividend Policies
The amount and frequency of dividends by constituent companies impact the total returns.

### Tax Considerations
[Taxes](../t/taxes.md) on dividends or [interest](../i/interest.md) impact the net [income](../i/income.md) that can be reinvested.

### Market Conditions
[Economic cycles](../e/economic_cycles.md), [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, and [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) impact the price changes and yields of assets included in TRIs.

## Benefits and Limitations

### Benefits
- **Comprehensive Performance Insight**: By considering both [capital](../c/capital.md) gains and [income](../i/income.md), TRIs provide a true picture of investment returns.
- **Better for Long-Term Analysis**: Suitable for long-term performance tracking where reinvesting [income](../i/income.md) is a practice.

### Limitations
- **Complexity in Calculation**: Requires tracking dividends, [interest](../i/interest.md), and their [reinvestment](../r/reinvestment.md), increasing complexity.
- **Variation Across Regions**: Different tax laws and [market](../m/market.md) practices impact the comparability of international TRIs.

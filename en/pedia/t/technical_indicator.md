# Technical Indicators

Technical indicators are mathematical calculations based on the price, [volume](../v/volume.md), or [open interest](../o/open_interest.md) of a [security](../s/security.md) or contract. By analyzing historical data, these indicators help traders forecast future price movements. They are a crucial part of [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md), used extensively in [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), including [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md). This document provides a detailed examination of common technical indicators, their mathematical formulas, and their application in trading.

## Types of Technical Indicators

### 1. Moving Averages

#### Simple Moving Average (SMA)

**Description:** The Simple Moving Average (SMA) is calculated by averaging a set number of past closing prices. It smooths out price data to identify the direction of the [trend](../t/trend.md).

**Formula:** 
\[ \text{SMA}(n) = \frac{P_1 + P_2 + ... + P_n}{n} \]
Where:
- \( n \) = number of periods
- \( P_i \) = price at each period

**Application:** Used to identify [trend](../t/trend.md) direction. A common strategy is to use two SMAs (a short-term and a long-term) and generate buy/sell signals based on crossovers.

#### Exponential Moving Average (EMA)

**Description:** The Exponential Moving Average (EMA), unlike the SMA, gives more weight to recent prices, making it more responsive to new information.

**Formula:**
\[ \text{EMA}_t = P_t \cdot k + \text{EMA}_{t-1} \cdot (1 - k) \]
Where:
- \( P_t \) = current price
- \( k = \frac{2}{n+1} \) (smoothing [factor](../f/factor.md))
- \( n \) = number of periods

**Application:** Similar to SMA, but used when a [trader](../t/trader.md) needs faster signal generation and less lag.

### 2. Momentum Indicators

#### Relative Strength Index (RSI)

**Description:** The [Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index.md) (RSI) measures the speed and change of price movements. It oscillates between 0 and 100.

**Formula:**
\[ \text{RSI} = 100 - \frac{100}{1 + RS} \]
\[ \text{RS} = \frac{\text{Average [Gain](../g/gain.md)}}{\text{Average Loss}} \]

**Application:** RSI values above 70 may indicate [overbought](../o/overbought.md) conditions, while values below 30 may indicate [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions.

#### Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)

**Description:** The MACD is a [momentum](../m/momentum.md) [oscillator](../o/oscillator.md) that follows trends. It shows the relationship between two moving averages of a [security](../s/security.md)’s price.

**Formula:**
\[ \text{MACD} = \text{EMA}_{12} - \text{EMA}_{26} \]
\[ \text{Signal Line} = \text{EMA}_9 \text{ of MACD} \]

**Application:** When the MACD line crosses above the signal line, it generates a buy signal. Conversely, when it crosses below, it generates a sell signal.

### 3. Volatility Indicators

#### Bollinger Bands

**Description:** [Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_band.md) consist of a middle band (SMA), an upper band (SMA + 2 standard deviations), and a lower band (SMA - 2 standard deviations).

**Formula:**
\[ \text{Upper Band} = \text{SMA}(n) + 2 \cdot \text{SD}(n) \]
\[ \text{Lower Band} = \text{SMA}(n) - 2 \cdot \text{SD}(n) \]

**Application:** Prices tend to bounce within the bands. When prices exceed the bands, it implies [overbought](../o/overbought.md)/[oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions.

### 4. Volume Indicators

#### On-Balance Volume (OBV)

**Description:** OBV uses [volume](../v/volume.md) flow to predict stock price movements. It adds [volume](../v/volume.md) on up days and subtracts [volume](../v/volume.md) on down days.

**Formula:**
\[ \text{OBV}_t = \begin{cases} 
    \text{OBV}_{t-1} + V_t & \text{if } P_t > P_{t-1} \\
    \text{OBV}_{t-1} - V_t & \text{if } P_t < P_{t-1} \\
    \text{OBV}_{t-1} & \text{if } P_t = P_{t-1} 
\end{cases}
\]
Where:
- \( P_t \) = current price
- \( V_t \) = [volume](../v/volume.md)

**Application:** [Divergence](../d/divergence.md) between OBV and price can indicate potential reversals.

### 5. Trend Indicators

#### Average Directional Index (ADX)

**Description:** ADX quantifies the strength of a [trend](../t/trend.md). It combines positive directional movement (+DI) and negative directional movement (-DI).

**Formula:**
\[ \text{ADX} = 100 \cdot \text{EMA}_{n} \left( \frac{|\text{+DI} - \text{-DI}|}{\text{+DI} + \text{-DI}} \right) \]

**Application:** ADX values above 25 indicate a strong [trend](../t/trend.md), while below 20 indicate a weak [trend](../t/trend.md).

### 6. Custom Indicators

Traders can also create custom indicators by combining different existing indicators or by developing completely new ones using programming languages. For [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), platforms like MetaTrader, [Amibroker](../a/amibroker.md), and [NinjaTrader](../n/ninjatrader.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) functionalities to develop custom technical indicators using languages like MQL, AFL, and C#.

# Theta Hedging

## Introduction to Theta Hedging

[Theta](../t/theta.md) hedging is a strategy used primarily in [options](../o/options.md) trading to manage the risks associated with the passage of time. [Theta](../t/theta.md) represents the rate at which the price of an [options contract](../o/options_contract.md) decreases as time progresses, holding all other factors constant. This concept is part of the famous "[Greeks](../g/greeks.md)" in [options](../o/options.md) trading, including [Delta](../d/delta.md), [Gamma](../g/gamma.md), [Vega](../v/vega.md), and [Rho](../r/rho.md), each providing different measurements of risks. [Theta](../t/theta.md) hedging specifically addresses the [risk](../r/risk.md) related to the decay in the [value](../v/value.md) of [options](../o/options.md) due to the time [factor](../f/factor.md).

## Understanding Theta in Options

[Theta](../t/theta.md) (Θ) is known as the [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) of [options](../o/options.md). It measures the sensitivity of the option's price to the passage of time. For example, if an option has a [Theta](../t/theta.md) of -0.05, it means that the option's price [will](../w/will.md) decrease by $0.05 each day, holding other factors constant.

Key Aspects of [Theta](../t/theta.md):
- **Negative [Theta](../t/theta.md)**: Both call and [put options](../p/put_options.md) generally have negative [theta](../t/theta.md), which means they lose [value](../v/value.md) as time goes by.
- **At-the-[Money](../m/money.md) [Options](../o/options.md)**: [Theta](../t/theta.md) is highest for at-the-[money](../m/money.md) [options](../o/options.md) and decreases as you move deeper in or out of the [money](../m/money.md).
- **Time to Expiration**: [Theta](../t/theta.md) increases as the option approaches expiration because the impact of [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) is more significant as expiry nears.

## Purpose of Theta Hedging

The primary purpose of [theta](../t/theta.md) hedging is to mitigate the losses that occur due to [time decay](../t/time_decay.md). Traders who [hold](../h/hold.md) long [options](../o/options.md) positions, such as long calls or long puts, are particularly exposed to [theta](../t/theta.md) decay. As time goes by, the [value](../v/value.md) of these [options](../o/options.md) declines, even if the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) does not move significantly. [Theta](../t/theta.md) [hedging strategies](../h/hedging_strategies.md) aim to counteract this loss in [value](../v/value.md).

## Strategies for Theta Hedging

### 1. **Calendar Spreads**

Calendar [spreads](../s/spreads.md), also known as time [spreads](../s/spreads.md), involve buying and selling [options](../o/options.md) with different expiration dates but the same [strike price](../s/strike_price.md). This strategy profits from the difference in [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) between the short-term and long-term [options](../o/options.md).

For example:
- **[Long Calendar Spread](../l/long_calendar_spread.md)**: Buy a long-term [call option](../c/call_option.md) and sell a short-term [call option](../c/call_option.md) with the same [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).
- This spread [will](../w/will.md) benefit from [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) differences; as the shorter-term option decays faster, the spread [value](../v/value.md) widens.

### 2. **Diagonal Spreads**

Diagonal [spreads](../s/spreads.md) are similar to calendar [spreads](../s/spreads.md) but involve [options](../o/options.md) with different strike prices and expiration dates. This strategy allows for adjustments in [strike price](../s/strike_price.md), providing more flexibility in managing [risk](../r/risk.md).

Example setup:
- **Long Diagonal Spread**: Buy a long-term [call option](../c/call_option.md) at a lower [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) and sell a short-term [call option](../c/call_option.md) at a higher [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).
- This benefits from both the [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) difference and potential movement in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

### 3. **Iron Condors**

Iron condors involve four [options](../o/options.md): selling a lower strike put, buying a higher strike put, selling a higher strike call, and buying an even higher strike call. This strategy profits from low [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and [time decay](../t/time_decay.md).

Example breakdown:
- **Sell a lower strike put** (`P1`).
- **Buy a higher strike put** (`P2`).
- **Sell a higher strike call** (`C1`).
- **Buy an even higher strike call** (`C2`).

This setup creates a [profit](../p/profit.md) zone where the [options](../o/options.md) can collectively decay in [value](../v/value.md), benefiting the [trader](../t/trader.md).

### 4. **Butterfly Spreads**

Butterfly [spreads](../s/spreads.md) involve three strike prices. A [trader](../t/trader.md) buys two [options](../o/options.md) at the outer strikes and sells two [options](../o/options.md) at the middle strike. This strategy profits from [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) and low [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

Example:
- **Buy a lower strike call** (`C1`).
- **Sell two middle strike calls** (`C2`).
- **Buy a higher strike call** (`C3`).

The maximum [profit](../p/profit.md) occurs if the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) is near the middle strike at expiration.

## Real-World Application

Companies and financial institutions use [theta](../t/theta.md) hedging techniques to minimize the risks associated with their [options](../o/options.md) portfolios. One notable application is by [market](../m/market.md)-making firms who provide [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) in the [options](../o/options.md) markets.

### Case Study: Chicago Trading Company (CTC)
[Chicago Trading Company](https://www.chicagotrading.com/)

Chicago Trading Company, a [proprietary trading](../p/proprietary_trading.md) [firm](../f/firm.md), employs various [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) strategies, including [theta](../t/theta.md) hedging. Their traders actively manage the [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) [risk](../r/risk.md) in their portfolios by implementing sophisticated [hedging strategies](../h/hedging_strategies.md) such as calendar [spreads](../s/spreads.md) and iron condors. This allows them to provide consistent [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) in the markets while minimizing exposure to unfavorable [time decay](../t/time_decay.md).

## Key Takeaways

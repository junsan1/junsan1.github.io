# Trading Strategies

Trading strategies are systematic methodologies or plans designed to achieve profitable returns by executing trades in financial markets. These strategies can be based on [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md), [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md), or a combination of both. They can be automated using [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) systems or executed manually by traders. Below, we delve into various trading strategies, their underlying principles, the markets they are applied to, and specific examples.

## Types of Trading Strategies

### 1. Trend Following

[Trend following](../t/trend_following.md) is a strategy that seeks to capitalize on the momentum of existing market trends. Traders using this strategy believe that prices that have been rising or falling for a particular period will continue to do so. Key tools for [trend following](../t/trend_following.md) include moving averages, trendlines, and various [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) like the Average Directional Index (ADX).

- **Moving Averages**: Simple (SMA) and Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) are widely used to identify the direction of the trend.
- **Trendlines**: Drawing lines that connect significant price points helps to visualize the trend.
- **Indicators**: ADX, Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), and Relative Strength Index (RSI) are commonly used indicators.

### 2. Mean Reversion

[Mean reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md) is based on the concept that asset prices will tend to revert to their historical average or mean price after departing from it. This strategy assumes markets oscillate around a mean value and aims to capitalize on extreme price movements, expecting a correction.

- **[Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md)**: Bands plotted two standard deviations away from a simple moving average can indicate overbought or oversold conditions.
- **RSI**: Used to identify potentially overbought (above 70) or oversold (below 30) conditions.

### 3. Arbitrage

[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) involves taking advantage of price discrepancies between different markets or instruments. This typically involves buying a security in one market and simultaneously selling it in another at a higher price, pocketing the difference.

- **Statistical [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**: Uses sophisticated mathematical models to identify [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) opportunities.
- **Merger [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**: Exploits price differences that arise before a merger or acquisition is completed.

### 4. Market Making

Market making involves providing liquidity to the market by placing bid and ask orders. Market makers profit from the spread between the buy and sell prices. This strategy is prevalent in high-frequency trading (HFT) where speed is crucial.

- **[Order Book Analysis](../o/order_book_analysis.md)**: Market makers analyze the order book to manage their positions and maintain liquidity.

### 5. Momentum Trading

[Momentum trading](../m/momentum_trading.md) is similar to [trend following](../t/trend_following.md) but focuses more on the volume and velocity of price movements. Traders seek to enter a trade when the momentum of the asset price is strong and ride the trend until signs of a reversal appear.

- **[Momentum Indicators](../m/momentum_indicators.md)**: Tools like the MACD and RSI help in identifying the strength and direction of momentum.

### 6. Swing Trading

[Swing trading](../s/swing_trading.md) seeks to capture gains within one to several days by taking advantage of market swings or oscillations. This strategy often involves [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) to determine entry and exit points.

- **Technical Patterns**: Patterns like head and shoulders, double tops/bottoms, and flags are used to predict potential swings.

### 7. Scalping

Scalping is a high-frequency trading strategy aiming for small profits on a high volume of trades, often holding positions for just seconds or minutes. Scalpers need access to higher execution speeds and lower transaction costs.

- **Tick Charts**: Used for analyzing very short-term price movements.
- **Level II Quotes**: Provide a deeper look into the order flow and market depth.

### 8. Pair Trading

Pair trading involves taking positions in two correlated assets with the aim of profiting from the relative movement between the two. This market-neutral strategy does not depend on the direction of the market.

- **[Correlation Analysis](../c/correlation_analysis.md)**: Used to identify pairs of securities that move together.

## Market-Specific Strategies

### Equity Markets

Equity markets provide ample opportunities for different trading strategies due to high liquidity and diverse instruments. 

- **Dividend Capture**: Involves buying a stock just before the ex-dividend date to capture the dividend and then selling it.
- **[Sector Rotation](../s/sector_rotation.md)**: Involves shifting investments from one sector to another to capitalize on different phases of the economic cycle.

### Forex Markets

Forex markets are highly liquid and operate 24/7, offering opportunities for various trading strategies.

- **[Carry Trade](../c/carry_trade.md)**: Involves borrowing in a currency with a low-interest rate and investing in a currency with a higher interest rate.
- **News Trading**: Taking advantage of the high volatility that news and economic releases bring to forex markets.

### Commodity Markets

Commodity markets involve trading in physical assets like gold, silver, oil, and agricultural products.

- **Seasonal Trading**: Based on historical seasonal patterns that certain commodities tend to follow.
- **[Spread Trading](../s/spread_trading.md)**: Involves trading the price difference between two related commodities.

### Cryptocurrency Markets

Cryptocurrency markets are known for their high volatility and are accessible 24/7, making them attractive for a wide range of strategies.

- **ICO Investing**: Involves investing in initial coin offerings with the expectation of significant returns.
- **Hodling**: Long-term buy-and-hold strategy that rides the overall growth of the cryptocurrency market.

## Algorithmic Trading and Automation

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), or algo trading, involves using computer programs to execute trades based on pre-defined criteria, providing several advantages like speed, accuracy, and the ability to back-test strategies.

### Popular Algorithmic Trading Strategies

- **High-Frequency Trading (HFT)**: Involves making thousands of trades per second, leveraging ultra-low latency and complex algorithms.
- **[Quantitative Trading](../q/quantitative_trading.md)**: Uses mathematical models to make trading decisions, including statistical [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) and [momentum trading](../m/momentum_trading.md).
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Utilize artificial intelligence to improve and optimize trading strategies over time.

# Trading Strategies

Trading strategies are systematic methodologies or plans designed to achieve profitable returns by executing trades in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). These strategies can be based on [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md), [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md), or a combination of both. They can be automated using [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) systems or executed manually by traders. Below, we delve into various trading strategies, their [underlying](../u/underlying.md) principles, the markets they are applied to, and specific examples.

## Types of Trading Strategies

### 1. Trend Following

[Trend following](../t/trend_following.md) is a strategy that seeks to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on the [momentum](../m/momentum.md) of existing [market](../m/market.md) trends. Traders using this strategy believe that prices that have been rising or falling for a particular period [will](../w/will.md) continue to do so. Key tools for [trend following](../t/trend_following.md) include moving averages, trendlines, and various [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) like the [Average Directional Index](../a/average_directional_index_(adx).md) (ADX).

- **Moving Averages**: Simple (SMA) and Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) are widely used to identify the direction of the [trend](../t/trend.md).
- **Trendlines**: Drawing lines that connect significant price points helps to visualize the [trend](../t/trend.md).
- **Indicators**: ADX, Moving Average Convergence [Divergence](../d/divergence.md) (MACD), and [Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (RSI) are commonly used indicators.

### 2. Mean Reversion

[Mean reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md) is based on the concept that [asset](../a/asset.md) prices [will](../w/will.md) tend to revert to their historical average or mean price after departing from it. This strategy assumes markets oscillate around a mean [value](../v/value.md) and aims to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on extreme price movements, expecting a [correction](../c/correction.md).

- **[Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md)**: Bands plotted two standard deviations away from a simple moving average can indicate [overbought](../o/overbought.md) or [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions.
- **RSI**: Used to identify potentially [overbought](../o/overbought.md) (above 70) or [oversold](../o/oversold.md) (below 30) conditions.

### 3. Arbitrage

[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) involves taking advantage of price discrepancies between different markets or instruments. This typically involves buying a [security](../s/security.md) in one [market](../m/market.md) and simultaneously selling it in another at a higher price, pocketing the difference.

- **Statistical [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**: Uses sophisticated [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md) to identify [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) opportunities.
- **[Merger](../m/merger.md) [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**: Exploits price differences that arise before a [merger](../m/merger.md) or [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) is completed.

### 4. Market Making

[Market](../m/market.md) making involves providing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) to the [market](../m/market.md) by placing [bid and ask](../b/bid_and_ask.md) orders. [Market](../m/market.md) makers [profit](../p/profit.md) from the spread between the buy and sell prices. This strategy is prevalent in high-frequency trading (HFT) where speed is crucial.

- **[Order Book Analysis](../o/order_book_analysis.md)**: [Market](../m/market.md) makers analyze the [order book](../o/order_book.md) to manage their positions and maintain [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).

### 5. Momentum Trading

[Momentum trading](../m/momentum_trading.md) is similar to [trend following](../t/trend_following.md) but focuses more on the [volume](../v/volume.md) and velocity of price movements. Traders seek to enter a [trade](../t/trade.md) when the [momentum](../m/momentum.md) of the [asset](../a/asset.md) price is strong and ride the [trend](../t/trend.md) until signs of a [reversal](../r/reversal.md) appear.

- **[Momentum Indicators](../m/momentum_indicators.md)**: Tools like the MACD and RSI help in identifying the strength and direction of [momentum](../m/momentum.md).

### 6. Swing Trading

[Swing trading](../s/swing_trading.md) seeks to capture gains within one to several days by taking advantage of [market](../m/market.md) swings or oscillations. This strategy often involves [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) to determine entry and exit points.

- **Technical Patterns**: Patterns like head and shoulders, double tops/bottoms, and flags are used to predict potential swings.

### 7. Scalping

[Scalping](../s/scalping.md) is a high-frequency [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) aiming for small profits on a high [volume](../v/volume.md) of trades, often holding positions for just seconds or minutes. Scalpers need access to higher [execution](../e/execution.md) speeds and lower [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md).

- **[Tick](../t/tick.md) Charts**: Used for analyzing very short-term price movements.
- **Level II Quotes**: Provide a deeper look into the [order](../o/order.md) flow and [market depth](../m/market_depth.md).

### 8. Pair Trading

Pair trading involves taking positions in two correlated assets with the aim of profiting from the relative movement between the two. This [market](../m/market.md)-[neutral](../n/neutral.md) strategy does not depend on the direction of the [market](../m/market.md).

- **[Correlation Analysis](../c/correlation_analysis.md)**: Used to identify pairs of securities that move together.

## Market-Specific Strategies

### Equity Markets

[Equity](../e/equity.md) markets provide ample opportunities for different trading strategies due to high [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and diverse instruments. 

- **[Dividend](../d/dividend.md) Capture**: Involves buying a stock just before the [ex-dividend](../e/ex-dividend.md) date to capture the [dividend](../d/dividend.md) and then selling it.
- **[Sector Rotation](../s/sector_rotation.md)**: Involves shifting investments from one sector to another to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on different phases of the [economic cycle](../e/economic_cycle.md).

### Forex Markets

Forex markets are highly [liquid](../l/liquid.md) and operate 24/7, [offering](../o/offering.md) opportunities for various trading strategies.

- **[Carry Trade](../c/carry_trade.md)**: Involves borrowing in a [currency](../c/currency.md) with a low-[interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) and [investing](../i/investing.md) in a [currency](../c/currency.md) with a higher [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md).
- **News Trading**: Taking advantage of the high [volatility](../v/volatility.md) that news and economic releases bring to forex markets.

### Commodity Markets

[Commodity](../c/commodity.md) markets involve trading in physical assets like gold, silver, oil, and agricultural products.

- **Seasonal Trading**: Based on historical seasonal patterns that certain commodities tend to follow.
- **[Spread Trading](../s/spread_trading.md)**: Involves trading the price difference between two related commodities.

### Cryptocurrency Markets

Cryptocurrency markets are known for their high [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and are accessible 24/7, making them attractive for a wide [range](../r/range.md) of strategies.

- **ICO [Investing](../i/investing.md)**: Involves [investing](../i/investing.md) in initial coin offerings with the expectation of significant returns.
- **Hodling**: Long-term buy-and-[hold](../h/hold.md) strategy that rides the overall growth of the cryptocurrency [market](../m/market.md).

## Algorithmic Trading and Automation

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), or algo trading, involves using computer programs to execute trades based on pre-defined criteria, providing several advantages like speed, accuracy, and the ability to back-test strategies.

### Popular Algorithmic Trading Strategies

- **High-Frequency Trading (HFT)**: Involves making thousands of trades per second, leveraging ultra-low latency and complex algorithms.
- **[Quantitative Trading](../q/quantitative_trading.md)**: Uses [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md) to make trading decisions, including statistical [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) and [momentum trading](../m/momentum_trading.md).
- **Machine [Learning Algorithms](../l/learning_algorithms_in_trading.md)**: Utilize [artificial intelligence](../a/artificial_intelligence_in_trading.md) to improve and optimize trading strategies over time.

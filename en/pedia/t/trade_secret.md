# Trade Secret

In the world of [business](../b/business.md) and [finance](../f/finance.md), a [trade](../t/trade.md) secret refers to any practice, design, formula, process, or any information that is not generally known or reasonably ascertainable by others, by which a [business](../b/business.md) can obtain an economic advantage over competitors or customers. [Trade](../t/trade.md) secrets are a type of intellectual property but unlike patents, they do not require public [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md).

## Definition and Characteristics

A [trade](../t/trade.md) secret is any confidential [business](../b/business.md) information that provides a company with a competitive edge. According to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), a [trade](../t/trade.md) secret can include sales methods, [distribution](../d/distribution.md) methods, consumer profiles, advertising strategies, lists of suppliers and clients, and [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) processes. 

For information to be considered a [trade](../t/trade.md) secret, it must meet the following criteria:
1. The information must be secret.
2. It must have commercial [value](../v/value.md) because it is secret.
3. The rightful holder of the information must take reasonable steps to keep it secret.

## Types of Trade Secrets

### Formulas and Recipes

One of the most classic examples of a [trade](../t/trade.md) secret is the formula for Coca-Cola. This formula has been kept secret since the company’s inception in the late 19th century. Similarly, the recipe for KFC's fried chicken is another well-guarded [trade](../t/trade.md) secret.

### Processes and Techniques

Companies often keep [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) processes and techniques as [trade](../t/trade.md) secrets to maintain a [competitive advantage](../c/competitive_advantage.md) over other players in the [market](../m/market.md). For example, the methods used by a tech company to produce its high-[efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) microchips or a pharmaceutical company's proprietary drug synthesis process.

### Customer Lists

A [customer](../c/customer.md) list is also considered a [trade](../t/trade.md) secret as it provides an economic advantage by giving a company more efficient access to key [market](../m/market.md) players.

### Business Plans and Strategies

Businesses may also keep their [business](../b/business.md) plans, strategies, and financial information secret to prevent competitors from gaining insights that could diminish their [competitive advantage](../c/competitive_advantage.md).

## Legal Framework

The protection of [trade](../t/trade.md) secrets varies by jurisdiction but generally falls under unfair competition and intellectual property laws. 

### United States

In the United States, the primary federal statute governing [trade](../t/trade.md) secrets is the Defend [Trade](../t/trade.md) Secrets Act (DTSA) of 2016. This act gives an owner of a [trade](../t/trade.md) secret the right to sue in federal court when that secret has been misappropriated. 

### European Union

The [European Union](../e/european_union_(eu).md) has its [Trade](../t/trade.md) Secrets Directive, which harmonizes the laws on [trade](../t/trade.md) secrets across EU member states. Implemented in 2016, it provides definitions and rules for the unlawful [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md), use, and [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) of [trade](../t/trade.md) secrets.

### International Agreements

[Trade](../t/trade.md) secrets are also covered under the Agreement on [Trade](../t/trade.md)-Related Aspects of Intellectual [Property Rights](../p/property_rights.md) (TRIPS Agreement), which establishes minimum standards for the protection and enforcement of intellectual [property rights](../p/property_rights.md), including [trade](../t/trade.md) secrets, among its member countries.

## Measures to Protect Trade Secrets

### Physical Security

Securing physical assets and documents that contain [trade](../t/trade.md) secrets is a basic yet critical measure. This could include locked file cabinets, secure office spaces, and surveillance systems.

### Digital Security

In today’s technology-driven world, protecting digital information is equally important. Encryption, firewalls, and secure access controls are methods used to protect digital [trade](../t/trade.md) secrets.

### Legal Agreements

Non-[disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) agreements (NDAs) are commonly used to protect [trade](../t/trade.md) secrets. These agreements legally bind parties to confidentiality regarding specific information. Employment contracts often include clauses protecting [trade](../t/trade.md) secrets even after an employee leaves the company.

### Internal Policies

Developing and implementing rigorous internal policies can effectively safeguard [trade](../t/trade.md) secrets. These policies may involve regular training for employees on the importance of maintaining confidentiality and the potential consequences of [trade](../t/trade.md) secret theft.

## Misappropriation of Trade Secrets

Misappropriation refers to the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) of a [trade](../t/trade.md) secret by someone who knows or should know that the [trade](../t/trade.md) secret was acquired by improper means. Improper means can include theft, bribery, misrepresentation, and breach of a duty to maintain secrecy.

### Famous Cases

#### Uber vs. Waymo

One of the most high-profile [trade](../t/trade.md) secret misappropriation cases in recent years involved Uber and Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. Waymo accused Uber of stealing its self-driving car technology. The suit was settled in 2018 with Uber agreeing to pay Waymo $245 million.

#### DuPont vs. Kolon Industries

DuPont filed a lawsuit against Kolon Industries alleging that Kolon had stolen its [trade](../t/trade.md) secrets related to Kevlar, a high-strength fiber used in various applications. In 2011, a jury awarded DuPont $919.9 million in damages.

## Impact of Trade Secret Theft

[Trade](../t/trade.md) secret theft can have devastating consequences for businesses. It can lead to loss of [competitive advantage](../c/competitive_advantage.md), financial losses, and damage to reputation. Moreover, the cost of litigation in [trade](../t/trade.md) secret cases is often substantial.

## Emerging Trends

### Big Data and Analytics

The rise of [big data](../b/big_data_in_trading.md) and analytics is a double-edged sword for [trade](../t/trade.md) secrets. On one hand, they provide companies with more information to develop [trade](../t/trade.md) secrets. On the other hand, they make it easier for [trade](../t/trade.md) secrets to be leaked or stolen.

### Cybersecurity

As businesses increasingly move online, cybersecurity has become paramount in protecting [trade](../t/trade.md) secrets. Advanced threats, such as cyber espionage, make [robust](../r/robust.md) cybersecurity measures essential.

### Globalization

[Globalization](../g/globalization.md) has made it easier for [trade](../t/trade.md) secrets to be misappropriated by foreign actors. Countries are increasingly cooperating to address [trade](../t/trade.md) secret theft, but differences in legal frameworks can complicate these efforts.

# Tax-Sheltered Annuity

A Tax-Sheltered Annuity (TSA), also known as a [403(b) plan](../1/403(b)_plan.md), is a type of retirement plan that allows employees of public schools, tax-exempt organizations, and certain ministers to invest pre-tax [earnings](../e/earnings.md) toward retirement. These plans share similarities with the widely known 401(k) plans and [offer](../o/offer.md) significant tax advantages to participants. This article [will](../w/will.md) delve into the intricacies of Tax-Sheltered Annuities, highlighting their benefits, eligibility requirements, contribution limits, and [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) rules.

## Overview

A TSA is designed to provide employees a way to save for retirement while benefiting from immediate tax deferral. These plans were established under section 403(b) of the Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Code, hence the alternative name. Contributions to a TSA are made through salary deferrals, reducing the employee’s [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md), and thus, [offering](../o/offering.md) an immediate tax advantage. Additionally, the investments grow [tax-deferred](../t/tax_deferred.md) until the proceeds are withdrawn, typically upon retirement.

## Eligibility

Eligibility for a Tax-Sheltered Annuity is limited to certain types of employers and employees, including:
- Employees of public school systems (teachers, administrators, etc.)
- Employees of tax-exempt organizations under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Code, such as hospitals, charitable organizations, and some religious organizations
- Ministers employed by eligible tax-exempt organizations or those who are self-employed

## Contribution Limits

The IRS sets contribution limits for TSAs, which are adjusted periodically for [inflation](../i/inflation.md). As of the latest guidelines, the basic employee contribution limit for a [403(b) plan](../1/403(b)_plan.md) is $22,500 per year (for individuals under age 50). Participants aged 50 and over can make additional "catch-up" contributions, raising the limit by $7,500, for a total of $30,000 annually. Beyond this, some plans [offer](../o/offer.md) a special catch-up [provision](../p/provision.md) for employees with 15 or more years of service with the same employer, potentially allowing for even higher contributions.

## Types of Investments

TSAs can [hold](../h/hold.md) a variety of investment [options](../o/options.md), mainly including:
- Annuities offered by [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies
- Mutual funds

These investment vehicles enable employees to diversify their retirement savings and potentially generate better returns over time. It is crucial to evaluate each investment's fees, risks, and performance history to make informed decisions.

## Tax Benefits

The primary tax benefits of a TSA are:
- Pre-tax Contributions: Contributions are made on a pre-tax [basis](../b/basis.md), reducing an employee’s current [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md). This deferral can lower immediate [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md).
- [Tax-Deferred](../t/tax_deferred.md) Growth: Investment gains, dividends, and [interest](../i/interest.md) within the TSA grow [tax-deferred](../t/tax_deferred.md), meaning [taxes](../t/taxes.md) are paid only upon [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md), typically in retirement when the participant might be in a lower tax bracket.

## Withdrawals and Distributions

Withdrawals from a Tax-Sheltered Annuity are subject to specific rules and penalties:
- **Qualified Distributions:** Generally, withdrawals can begin at age 59 ½ without incurring a 10% early [withdrawal penalty](../w/withdrawal_penalty.md). These distributions are taxed as [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md).
- **Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs):** The IRS mandates that TSA participants start taking required minimum distributions by April 1 following the year they reach age 72 (or 70 ½ if they reached that age before Jan 1, 2020), and annually thereafter.
- **Hardship Withdrawals:** Some plans permit hardship withdrawals before age 59 ½ under severe financial hardship conditions, although these withdrawals may still be subject to penalties and [taxes](../t/taxes.md).

## Loan Provisions

Many 403(b) plans include [loan](../l/loan.md) provisions, allowing participants to borrow from their accounts. The IRS permits plan loans up to the lesser of $50,000 or 50% of the vested [account balance](../a/account_balance.md). Loans must be repaid with [interest](../i/interest.md), typically within five years, although the term can extend if the [loan](../l/loan.md) is for purchasing a primary residence. Failure to repay the [loan](../l/loan.md) as stipulated can result in the balance being treated as a taxable [distribution](../d/distribution.md), with applicable penalties.

## Selection of Annuity Contracts

When opting for an annuity product within a TSA, participants have several considerations:
- **Fixed Annuities:** These annuities [offer](../o/offer.md) guaranteed returns and fixed periodic payments. They are considered lower-[risk](../r/risk.md) and suitable for those seeking stable [income](../i/income.md) in retirement.
- **Variable Annuities:** Variable annuities provide returns based on the performance of [underlying](../u/underlying.md) investments (such as mutual funds). They carry higher [risk](../r/risk.md) but [offer](../o/offer.md) the potential for greater returns compared to fixed annuities.
- **Indexed Annuities:** These annuities are linked to the performance of [market](../m/market.md) indices (like the S&P 500). They [offer](../o/offer.md) a balance between fixed and variable annuities, with potential for higher returns linked to [market](../m/market.md) performance and a level of [principal](../p/principal.md) protection.

It is important for participants to thoroughly review annuity contracts, paying close attention to fees, surrender charges, and the credibility of the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) provider.

## Plan Administration and Compliance

Employers [offering](../o/offering.md) TSA plans must adhere to strict administrative and compliance requirements, including:
- **Plan Document:** Employers must maintain a written plan document that outlines the terms and conditions of the [403(b) plan](../1/403(b)_plan.md).
- **Employee Notification:** Employers are required to inform eligible employees about the plan, including how to enroll and the benefits available.
- **Annual Reporting:** Compliance with IRS regulations mandates annual reporting using Form 5500, detailing the plan’s financial status and operational data.

Employers may engage third-party administrators (TPAs) to [handle](../h/handle.md) the administrative duties and ensure compliance with IRS regulations, thereby reducing the burden on [in-house](../i/in-house.md) staff.

## Comparing 403(b) Plans and 401(k) Plans

While 403(b) and 401(k) plans share several similarities, there are noteworthy distinctions:
- **Eligible Employers:** 401(k) plans are typically offered by for-[profit](../p/profit.md) companies, whereas 403(b) plans are exclusive to public schools, non-profits, and certain ministers.
- **Investment [Options](../o/options.md):** 403(b) plans are often limited to annuities and mutual funds, whereas 401(k) plans tend to [offer](../o/offer.md) a broader [range](../r/range.md) of investment choices.
- **Special Catch-Up [Provision](../p/provision.md):** 403(b) plans may allow participants with 15 or more years of service an additional catch-up contribution, not available in 401(k) plans.

Both plan types provide [robust](../r/robust.md) avenues for retirement savings, and participants should evaluate their specific circumstances, employer offerings, and retirement goals when deciding between the two.

## Conclusion

Tax-Sheltered Annuities [offer](../o/offer.md) a powerful tool for employees of public schools, non-profits, and certain religious organizations to save for retirement with considerable tax advantages. Understanding the rules, benefits, and investment [options](../o/options.md) of TSAs can help participants make the most of their retirement savings. Whether through fixed, variable, or indexed annuities, or mutual funds, employees can tailor their TSA to align with their financial goals and [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md). Employers, meanwhile, must ensure diligent administration and compliance to sustain the benefits of these plans for their workforce.

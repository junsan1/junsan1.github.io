This document [will](../w/will.md) delve into various aspects of TIAA, including its history, product offerings, investment strategies, and overall impact on the financial [industry](../i/industry.md).

## History of TIAA

TIAA was founded by Andrew Carnegie in 1918. Despite the economic challenges posed by World War I, Carnegie saw the need for a secure and stable retirement system for teachers—a profession he held in high regard. He provided an initial [endowment](../e/endowment.md) to establish TIAA, aimed at creating a reliable pension system to ensure that educators could retire with dignity and financial [security](../s/security.md).

Early on, TIAA primarily offered fixed annuities, which provided a stable and predictable stream of [income](../i/income.md) for retirees. This conservative approach ensured that retirement [income](../i/income.md) was secure and not subject to [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md). Over the decades, TIAA expanded its investment strategies to better meet the evolving needs of its participants.

## Product Offerings

TIAA provides a comprehensive suite of financial products, each tailored to address specific individual and institutional needs. The primary product categories include retirement plans, investment products, and [insurance](../i/insurance.md) solutions.

- **403(b) Plans:** A type of [tax-advantaged](../t/tax-advantaged.md) retirement plan for employees of public schools and tax-exempt organizations. Similar to 401(k) plans, 403(b) plans [offer](../o/offer.md) employees the option to defer a portion of their salary to a retirement account.
- **457 Plans:** [Deferred compensation](../d/deferred_compensation.md) plans available to state and local public employees, and certain non-[profit](../p/profit.md) employees. Contributions are made on a pre-tax [basis](../b/basis.md), and the investments grow [tax-deferred](../t/tax_deferred.md).
- **IRAs (Individual Retirement Accounts):** TIAA offers both Traditional and Roth IRAs, giving individuals the flexibility to choose the tax treatment that best suits their retirement needs.

## Investment Strategies

TIAA employs several strategic approaches to manage and grow its clients' investments. Key strategies include:

### Diversification

[Diversification](../d/diversification.md) is a cornerstone of TIAA's investment philosophy. By spreading investments across various [asset](../a/asset.md) classes—such as equities, [fixed income](../f/fixed_income.md), [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), and alternative investments—TIAA seeks to mitigate [risk](../r/risk.md) and enhance returns. The goal is to construct a well-balanced portfolio that can endure [market](../m/market.md) fluctuations and provide steady growth over time.

### Active vs. Passive Management

TIAA employs both active and passive [investment management](../i/investment_management.md) strategies:

- **Passive Management:** This approach seeks to replicate the performance of a specific [index](../i/index.md), such as the S&P 500. Passively managed funds typically have lower expenses and are designed to match the returns of the [index](../i/index.md) they track.

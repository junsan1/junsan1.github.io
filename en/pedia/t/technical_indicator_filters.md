# Technical Indicator Filters

Technical indicator filters are crucial tools in the world of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) (also known as algo-trading or electronic trading). These filters leverage statistical methodologies and data analytics to aid traders in making more informed decisions. By integrating [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md), traders can filter out market noise to pinpoint the most promising trading opportunities.

## Understanding Technical Indicator Filters

Technical indicator filters are algorithms that analyze historical market data, such as price and volume, to identify patterns and trends. These patterns help traders forecast future market movements. Generally, [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) can be categorized into three main types:

1. **[Trend Indicators](../t/trend_indicators.md)**: These help identify the direction of the market. Examples include Moving Averages (SMA and EMA) and the Average Directional Index (ADX).
2. **[Momentum Indicators](../m/momentum_indicators.md)**: These measure the rate of change in the price of an asset. Examples include the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD).
3. **Volatility Indicators**: These assess the degree of price variation over a given period. Examples include [Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md) and the Average True Range (ATR).

By leveraging these [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) in algo-[trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), a trading system can automatically generate buy or sell signals based on pre-defined criteria, enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of the trading process.

## Types of Technical Indicator Filters

### Moving Averages (MA)
Moving averages are among the simplest and most commonly used technical indicator filters. By averaging asset prices over a specified period, these indicators smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends.

- **Simple Moving Average (SMA)**: This is calculated by adding up the closing prices over a specific period and dividing by the number of periods.
- **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**: This gives more weight to recent prices, making it more responsive to new information.

#### Example of Implementation:
```python
def SMA(prices, period):
    return sum(prices[-period:]) / period

def EMA(prices, period):
    ema = []
    k = 2 / (period + 1)
    ema.append(prices[0])  # starting with the first price for simplicity
    for price in prices[1:]:
        ema.append(price * k + ema[-1] * (1 - k))
    return ema
```

### Relative Strength Index (RSI)
The RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It ranges from 0 to 100 and is typically used to identify overbought or oversold conditions.

- Levels above 70 often indicate an overbought condition.
- Levels below 30 often indicate an oversold condition.

#### Example of Implementation:
```python
def RSI(prices, period=14):
    deltas = [prices[i] - prices[i-1] for i in range(1, len(prices))]
    seed = deltas[:period]
    
    up = sum([x for x in seed if x > 0]) / period
    down = -sum([x for x in seed if x < 0]) / period
    rs = up / down
    
    rsi = [100 - 100 / (1 + rs)]
    
    for delta in deltas[period:]:
        if delta > 0:
            up_val = delta
            down_val = 0
        else:
            up_val = 0
            down_val = -delta
            
        up = (up * (period - 1) + up_val) / period
        down = (down * (period - 1) + down_val) / period
        
        rs = up / down
        rsi.append(100 - 100 / (1 + rs))
        
    return rsi
```

### Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
The MACD is a momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a securityâ€™s price. It's calculated by subtracting the 26-period EMA from the 12-period EMA.

- **MACD Line** = 12-period EMA - 26-period EMA
- **Signal Line** = 9-period EMA of the MACD Line
- **Histogram** = MACD Line - Signal Line

#### Example of Implementation:
```python
def MACD(prices, short_period=12, long_period=26, signal_period=9):
    short_ema = EMA(prices, short_period)
    long_ema = EMA(prices, long_period)
    macd_line = [short - long for short, long in zip(short_ema, long_ema)]
    signal_line = EMA(macd_line, signal_period)
    histogram = [macd - signal for macd, signal in zip(macd_line, signal_line)]
    
    return macd_line, signal_line, histogram
```

### Bollinger Bands
[Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md) are volatility bands placed above and below a moving average. They consist of:

- A middle band being a simple moving average.
- An upper band at an MA plus twice the daily standard deviation.
- A lower band at an MA minus twice the daily standard deviation.

#### Example of Implementation:
```python
import numpy as np

def Bollinger_Bands(prices, period=20, num_of_sd=2):
    sma = SMA(prices, period)
    rolling_std = np.std(prices[-period:])
    
    upper_band = sma + (rolling_std * num_of_sd)
    lower_band = sma - (rolling_std * num_of_sd)
    
    return upper_band, sma, lower_band
```

### Average True Range (ATR)
The ATR measures market volatility by decomposing the entire range of an asset price for a given period. The true range is:

- **True Range**: Maximum of (High - Low, High - Previous Close, Previous Close - Low)
- **ATR**: Average of the True Range over the specified period.

#### Example of Implementation:
```python
def ATR(highs, lows, closes, period=14):
    tr_list = [max(h-l, abs(h-pc), abs(l-pc)) for h, l, pc in zip(highs, lows, closes[1:])]
    atr = [sum(tr_list[:period]) / period]
    
    for tr in tr_list[period:]:
        atr.append((atr[-1] * (period - 1) + tr) / period)
        
    return atr
```

## Practical Applications

### Entry and Exit Signals
Technical indicator filters are primarily used for generating entry and exit signals in algo-[trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md). For instance, if the MACD line crosses above the Signal line, it might generate a buy signal, whereas a cross below might generate a sell signal.

### Risk Management
[Technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) are also employed in [risk management](../r/risk_management.md). For example, [Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md) can help identify volatility and thereby determine stop-loss levels, ensuring that potential losses are minimized.

### Portfolio Optimization
Advanced [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) can aid in [portfolio optimization](../p/portfolio_optimization.md) by evaluating the strength of different assets in the portfolio, thus helping to reallocate capital towards higher-performing assets.

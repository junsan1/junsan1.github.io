# Technical Indicator Filters

Technical [indicator](../i/indicator.md) filters are crucial tools in the world of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) (also known as algo-trading or electronic trading). These filters [leverage](../l/leverage.md) statistical methodologies and [data analytics](../d/data_analytics.md) to aid traders in making more informed decisions. By integrating [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md), traders can filter out [market](../m/market.md) [noise](../n/noise.md) to pinpoint the most promising trading opportunities.

## Understanding Technical Indicator Filters

Technical [indicator](../i/indicator.md) filters are algorithms that analyze historical [market](../m/market.md) data, such as price and [volume](../v/volume.md), to identify patterns and trends. These patterns help traders forecast future [market](../m/market.md) movements. Generally, [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) can be categorized into three main types:

1. **[Trend Indicators](../t/trend_indicators.md)**: These help identify the direction of the [market](../m/market.md). Examples include Moving Averages (SMA and EMA) and the [Average Directional Index](../a/average_directional_index_(adx).md) (ADX).
2. **[Momentum Indicators](../m/momentum_indicators.md)**: These measure the rate of change in the price of an [asset](../a/asset.md). Examples include the [Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (RSI) and the Moving Average Convergence [Divergence](../d/divergence.md) (MACD).
3. **[Volatility](../v/volatility.md) Indicators**: These assess the degree of price variation over a given period. Examples include [Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md) and the [Average True Range](../a/average_true_range_(atr).md) (ATR).

By leveraging these [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) in algo-[trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), a trading system can automatically generate buy or sell signals based on pre-defined criteria, enhancing the effectiveness and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) of the trading process.

## Types of Technical Indicator Filters

### Moving Averages (MA)
Moving averages are among the simplest and most commonly used technical [indicator](../i/indicator.md) filters. By averaging [asset](../a/asset.md) prices over a specified period, these indicators smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends.

- **Simple Moving Average (SMA)**: This is calculated by adding up the closing prices over a specific period and dividing by the number of periods.
- **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**: This gives more weight to recent prices, making it more responsive to new information.

#### Example of Implementation:
```python
def SMA(prices, period):
    [return](../r/return.md) sum(prices[-period:]) / period

def EMA(prices, period):
    ema = []
    k = 2 / (period + 1)
    ema.append(prices[0])  # starting with the first price for simplicity
    for price in prices[1:]:
        ema.append(price * k + ema[-1] * (1 - k))
    [return](../r/return.md) ema
```

### Relative Strength Index (RSI)
The RSI is a [momentum](../m/momentum.md) [oscillator](../o/oscillator.md) that measures the speed and change of price movements. It ranges from 0 to 100 and is typically used to identify [overbought](../o/overbought.md) or [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions.

- Levels above 70 often indicate an [overbought](../o/overbought.md) condition.
- Levels below 30 often indicate an [oversold](../o/oversold.md) condition.

#### Example of Implementation:
```python
def RSI(prices, period=14):
    deltas = [prices[i] - prices[i-1] for i in [range](../r/range.md)(1, len(prices))]
    seed = deltas[:period]
    
    up = sum([x for x in seed if x > 0]) / period
    down = -sum([x for x in seed if x < 0]) / period
    rs = up / down
    
    rsi = [100 - 100 / (1 + rs)]
    
    for [delta](../d/delta.md) in deltas[period:]:
        if [delta](../d/delta.md) > 0:
            up_val = [delta](../d/delta.md)
            down_val = 0
        else:
            up_val = 0
            down_val = -[delta](../d/delta.md)
            
        up = (up * (period - 1) + up_val) / period
        down = (down * (period - 1) + down_val) / period
        
        rs = up / down
        rsi.append(100 - 100 / (1 + rs))
        
    [return](../r/return.md) rsi
```

### Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
The MACD is a [momentum](../m/momentum.md) [indicator](../i/indicator.md) that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a [security](../s/security.md)â€™s price. It's calculated by subtracting the 26-period EMA from the 12-period EMA.

- **MACD Line** = 12-period EMA - 26-period EMA
- **Signal Line** = 9-period EMA of the MACD Line
- **[Histogram](../h/histogram.md)** = MACD Line - Signal Line

#### Example of Implementation:
```python
def MACD(prices, short_period=12, long_period=26, signal_period=9):
    short_ema = EMA(prices, short_period)
    long_ema = EMA(prices, long_period)
    macd_line = [short - long for short, long in zip(short_ema, long_ema)]
    signal_line = EMA(macd_line, signal_period)
    [histogram](../h/histogram.md) = [macd - signal for macd, signal in zip(macd_line, signal_line)]
    
    [return](../r/return.md) macd_line, signal_line, [histogram](../h/histogram.md)
```

### Bollinger Bands
[Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md) are [volatility](../v/volatility.md) bands placed above and below a moving average. They consist of:

- A middle band being a simple moving average.
- An upper band at an MA plus twice the daily [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md).
- A lower band at an MA minus twice the daily [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md).

#### Example of Implementation:
```python
[import](../i/import.md) numpy as np

def Bollinger_Bands(prices, period=20, num_of_sd=2):
    sma = SMA(prices, period)
    rolling_std = np.std(prices[-period:])
    
    upper_band = sma + (rolling_std * num_of_sd)
    lower_band = sma - (rolling_std * num_of_sd)
    
    [return](../r/return.md) upper_band, sma, lower_band
```

### Average True Range (ATR)
The ATR measures [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) by decomposing the entire [range](../r/range.md) of an [asset](../a/asset.md) price for a given period. The true [range](../r/range.md) is:

- **True [Range](../r/range.md)**: Maximum of (High - Low, High - Previous Close, Previous Close - Low)
- **ATR**: Average of the True [Range](../r/range.md) over the specified period.

#### Example of Implementation:
```python
def ATR(highs, lows, closes, period=14):
    tr_list = [max(h-l, abs(h-pc), abs(l-pc)) for h, l, pc in zip(highs, lows, closes[1:])]
    atr = [sum(tr_list[:period]) / period]
    
    for tr in tr_list[period:]:
        atr.append((atr[-1] * (period - 1) + tr) / period)
        
    [return](../r/return.md) atr
```

## Practical Applications

### Entry and Exit Signals
Technical [indicator](../i/indicator.md) filters are primarily used for generating entry and exit signals in algo-[trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md). For instance, if the MACD line crosses above the Signal line, it might generate a buy signal, whereas a cross below might generate a sell signal.

### Risk Management
[Technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) are also employed in [risk management](../r/risk_management.md). For example, [Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md) can help identify [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and thereby determine stop-loss levels, ensuring that potential losses are minimized.

### Portfolio Optimization
Advanced [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) can aid in [portfolio optimization](../p/portfolio_optimization.md) by evaluating the strength of different assets in the portfolio, thus helping to reallocate [capital](../c/capital.md) towards higher-performing assets.

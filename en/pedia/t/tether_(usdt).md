# Tether (USDT)

Tether (USDT) is among the most significant and widely-used stablecoins in the cryptocurrency [market](../m/market.md). It was designed with the aim of minimizing the [volatility](../v/volatility.md) characteristic of cryptocurrencies like [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) and [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md), by [pegging](../p/pegging.md) its [value](../v/value.md) to a stable [asset](../a/asset.md), typically the US dollar. Here, we delve deeply into the meaning, structure, and various uses of Tether (USDT) in the crypto world.

## What is Tether (USDT)?

Tether (USDT) is a type of [digital currency](../d/digital_currency.md) known as a stablecoin. Unlike other cryptocurrencies that experience price [volatility](../v/volatility.md) due to [market](../m/market.md) fluctuations, Tether is designed to maintain a consistent [value](../v/value.md) by being pegged to fiat currencies such as the US dollar. Each USDT token is intended to be backed by one US dollar held in reserve by the company behind Tether, thus providing a stable [value](../v/value.md) [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md).

Tether was introduced in 2014 by a Hong Kong-based company known as Tether Limited, a subsidiary of iFinex, which also owns the cryptocurrency [exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Bitfinex](../b/bitfinex.md). The creation of Tether aimed to facilitate transactions between cryptocurrency exchanges by providing a stable alternative to fiat currencies.

## How Does Tether (USDT) Work?

Tether operates on [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology, like most cryptocurrencies but distinguishes itself by leveraging a different mechanism to maintain stability. Here's a breakdown:

### Pegging and Reserves
The main feature of Tether is its 1:1 peg to the US dollar. This means that for every USDT issued, Tether Limited claims to [hold](../h/hold.md) one US dollar in reserve. These reserves supposedly include traditional [currency](../c/currency.md) and [cash equivalents](../c/cash_equivalents.md) but remain a topic of contention and legal scrutiny.

### Blockchain Protocols
Tether (USDT) was initially launched on the [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) via the Omni Layer Protocol. However, as technology evolved and the need for higher [transaction](../t/transaction.md) [throughput](../t/throughput.md) arose, Tether expanded its operations to be compatible with [multiple](../m/multiple.md) blockchains. Today, USDT can be found on [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) (as an ERC-20 token), TRON (as a TRC-20 token), and other blockchains like Algorand, [EOS](../e/eos.md), [Liquid](../l/liquid.md) Network, and [Bitcoin Cash](../b/bitcoin_cash.md)â€™s SLP.

### Issuance and Redemption
Users can obtain USDT tokens via crypto exchanges or through Tether Limited directly. The process of [redemption](../r/redemption.md), or converting USDT back to fiat [currency](../c/currency.md), is intended to be just as straightforward: users [tender](../t/tender.md) their USDT tokens to Tether Limited, which then redeems them for the equivalent amount of US dollars, thereby destroying the redeemed USDT tokens.

## Uses of Tether (USDT)

### 1. Trading and Arbitrage
Tether is predominantly used on cryptocurrency exchanges for trading and [arbitrage opportunities](../a/arbitrage_opportunities.md). USDT provides a stable [asset](../a/asset.md) to [trade](../t/trade.md) against other volatile cryptocurrencies without the need to convert to [fiat money](../f/fiat_money.md), which can be time-consuming and incur extra fees. This facilitates easier and faster [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) across different exchanges.

### 2. Safe Haven
Investors often convert their volatile crypto assets to Tether during periods of high [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md). By moving their [holdings](../h/holdings.md) to USDT, they can avoid potential losses while staying within the crypto ecosystem, allowing them to quickly re-enter the [market](../m/market.md) when conditions stabilize.

### 3. Remittances
Tether's stable [value](../v/value.md) and fast [transaction](../t/transaction.md) speeds make it ideal for cross-border remittances. Sending USDT incurs lower [transaction fees](../t/transaction_fees.md) compared to traditional methods like SWIFT transfers. Additionally, recipients can convert USDT to their local [currency](../c/currency.md) at local crypto exchanges or utilize it within the cryptocurrency [market](../m/market.md).

### 4. Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
USDT plays a critical role in the burgeoning DeFi space. Many DeFi protocols use stablecoins to provide [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), [collateral](../c/collateral.md) for loans, or as a [medium of exchange](../m/medium_of_exchange.md). Tether's wide acceptance and stable [value](../v/value.md) make it a preferred choice for engaging in DeFi activities such as [yield](../y/yield.md) farming, staking, and lending.

### 5. Payment Solutions
Several merchants and platforms have begun accepting USDT as a form of [payment](../p/payment.md). This is especially useful for international transactions, enabling faster and cheaper cross-border payments compared to traditional banking systems.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite its widespread use, Tether has been at the center of several controversies:

### Lack of Transparency
One of the main criticisms against Tether is the lack of [transparency](../t/transparency.md) regarding its reserves. For a long time, there was skepticism about whether Tether Limited had sufficient reserves to back all issued USDT tokens. Although the company has since released audit reports to alleviate concerns, skepticism remains.

### Legal Issues
Tether Limited and its associated parties have been involved in various legal challenges. In 2019, the New York Attorney General's office accused Tether and [Bitfinex](../b/bitfinex.md) of covering up losses amounting to $850 million.

### Market Manipulation Allegations
Tether has faced allegations of [market manipulation](../m/market_manipulation.md), particularly regarding the 2017 [bull](../b/bull.md) run. Critics argue that Tether was used to inflate the prices of cryptocurrencies, including [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md).

## Future Outlook

The future of Tether (USDT) holds both promise and [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md). Regulatory scrutiny is likely to increase, and ongoing developments in central [bank](../b/bank.md) digital currencies (CBDCs) might affect Tether's [market](../m/market.md) position. Nonetheless, its role in facilitating transactions and serving as a stable [asset](../a/asset.md) within the volatile crypto [market](../m/market.md) remains indispensable.

# Tax Reform Act of 1986

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA) is a significant piece of legislation in the history of United States tax policy. Enacted on October 22, 1986, it represented one of the most comprehensive overhauls of the U.S. tax system since the inception of the federal income tax. The Act aimed to simplify the income tax code, broaden the tax base, and eliminate many tax shelters and preferences. The effort was a bipartisan one, spearheaded by President Ronald Reagan, with significant contributions from both Democrats and Republicans.

## Key Objectives

The primary goals of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 were:
1. **Simplify the Tax Code:** The Act sought to make the tax system easier to understand and more equitable.
2. **Broaden the Tax Base:** By eliminating numerous deductions and loopholes, the Act intended to create a broader tax base.
3. **Ensure Revenue Neutrality:** The legislation aimed to restructure the tax code without significantly changing the overall tax revenue.

## Major Provisions

### Individual Income Tax

1. **Rate Reduction:** The Act reduced the marginal tax rates on individual income. The highest marginal rate was cut from 50% to 28%, and the lowest rate was increased from 11% to 15%.
2. **Standard Deduction and Personal Exemption:** The standard deduction was increased to $5,000 for married couples filing jointly and $3,000 for single filers. Additionally, the personal exemption was increased to $2,000.
3. **Elimination of Many Deductions and Credits:** The Act eliminated the deductibility of certain expenses, including consumer interest, state and local sales taxes, and miscellaneous itemized deductions. However, it retained and adjusted the home mortgage interest and charitable contribution deductions.
4. **Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT):** The AMT was expanded to ensure that high-income earners paid a minimum level of tax, despite claiming various deductions and credits.

### Corporate Income Tax

1. **Rate Reduction:** The corporate tax rate was reduced from 46% to 34%.
2. **Limitations on Corporate Deductions:** The Act limited the deductibility of interest on debt and certain types of corporate expenses.
3. **Investment Tax Credit:** The Investment Tax Credit was eliminated, which previously allowed businesses to reduce their tax liability in return for certain investments.
4. **Foreign Earnings:** The Act changed how foreign earnings of U.S. corporations were taxed, moving towards addressing the issue of tax deferrals and tax havens.

### Capital Gains

The Act aligned the tax rate on capital gains with the tax rate on ordinary income, simplifying the tax treatment of different types of income.

## Impact on Different Sectors

### Real Estate

The elimination of certain tax shelters significantly impacted the real estate market. For instance, the removal of the deduction for rental property losses affected investors substantially. However, the retention of the home mortgage interest deduction helped mitigate some negative impacts on the housing market.

### Investment and Financial Sectors

By eliminating the Investment Tax Credit and certain deductions for interest and capital losses, the Act aimed to increase the equity of taxation on different types of investments. The alignment of capital gains tax with ordinary income tax rates simplified investment decisions and tax planning activities.

### Corporate Sector

The reduction in corporate tax rates was well-received, though the limitation on interest deductions presented challenges for heavily leveraged companies. Additionally, changes to foreign earnings taxation pushed companies to reconsider their international taxation strategies.

## Long-term Effects

### Economic Growth

The reduction in marginal tax rates on individual and corporate income was intended to promote economic growth by increasing disposable income and incentives for investment.

### Tax Compliance and Administration

By simplifying the tax code and eliminating numerous deductions, the Act aimed to reduce tax evasion and improve compliance rates. Over time, it became evident that while some complexities were reduced, new complexities arose, particularly in interpreting and implementing the changes.

### Budget Deficit

Initially designed to be revenue-neutral, the Act led to a reduction in tax revenues, contributing to increasing budget deficits in the following years. Subsequent administrations had to tackle these deficits, leading to further changes in the tax code.

## Criticisms and Challenges

While the Tax Reform Act of 1986 achieved several of its intended goals, it was not without criticism:

1. **Equity Issues:** Critics argued that the reduction in top marginal tax rates primarily benefited high-income earners, potentially increasing income inequality.
2. **Complexity:** Despite efforts to simplify the tax code, the Act introduced new complexities, particularly in the treatment of different types of income and deductions.
3. **Revenue Concerns:** The anticipated revenue neutrality did not fully materialize, contributing to budget deficits and necessitating future fiscal adjustments.

## Conclusion

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 stands as a landmark in U.S. tax policy. By radically restructuring the tax code, it aimed to create a fairer, simpler, and more efficient system. While it succeeded in many respects, the Act's long-term impact, both positive and negative, continues to be a subject of analysis and debate among policymakers and economists. The legacy of the Act highlights the complexities inherent in comprehensive tax reform and underscores the ongoing challenges in balancing equity, simplicity, and revenue needs in tax policy.

# Title Search

## Definition
A title search is a thorough examination of public records to determine and confirm a property's legal ownership and to find out what claims or liens may exist against the property.

## Key Aspects

### 2. Scope
- Typically covers a period of 50-60 years of ownership history
- May go back further if significant issues are found

### 3. Conducted By
- Title companies
- [Real estate](../r/real_estate.md) attorneys
- Professional title searchers

## Process Components

   - Verify legal description and address
   - Confirm property boundaries

2. **Ownership History**

## Importance in Financial Transactions

### 1. Mortgage Lending

2. **Potential Delays**
   - Issues found may delay closing and affect [financing](../f/financing.md)
   - Can impact timelines in [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) deals

3. **Property [Valuation](../v/valuation.md)**

# Technical Analysis Methods

## Introduction

[Technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) is a method used in trading to evaluate securities and attempt to forecast their future price movements by analyzing historical market data, primarily price, and volume. It is a cornerstone of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), where strategies are designed and implemented using computational power to make trading decisions. [Technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) relies on various indicators and [chart patterns](../c/chart_patterns.md) to identify trends and potential reversal points. Below is an in-depth look at several of the most widely used [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) methods.

## Moving Averages

### Simple Moving Average (SMA)

A Simple Moving Average calculates the mean of a selected range of prices by the number of periods in that range. It is commonly used to smooth out price data to identify the direction of a trend.

Example Formula:
```
SMA = (P1 + P2 + P3 + ... + Pn) / n
```
Where `P` is the price and `n` is the number of periods.

SMA's primary use is in trend identification. When the price crosses above the SMA, it can be a signal to buy, and when it crosses below, it indicates a potential sell signal.

### Exponential Moving Average (EMA)

The Exponential Moving Average gives more weight to the most recent prices, reducing the lag compared to the SMA. It responds more quickly to recent price changes.

Example Formula:
```
EMA_today = (Price_today * (2 / (n + 1))) + (EMA_yesterday * (1 - (2 / (n + 1))))
```

The EMA is particularly useful for capturing short-term momentum and is widely used in conjunction with other indicators like the MACD.

## Oscillators

### Relative Strength Index (RSI)

The RSI measures the speed and change of price movements, oscillating between 0 and 100. It is generally used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in a market. 

Example Formula:
```
RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))
RS = Average Gain / Average Loss
```

An RSI above 70 indicates overbought conditions, while an RSI below 30 indicates oversold conditions.

### Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)

The MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a securityâ€™s price. It consists of the MACD line, the signal line, and a histogram.

Example Calculation:
```
MACD Line = 12-day EMA - 26-day EMA
Signal Line = 9-day EMA of MACD Line
Histogram = MACD Line - Signal Line
```

Crossovers between the MACD line and the signal line are used to generate buy and sell signals.

## Chart Patterns

### Head and Shoulders

The [Head and Shoulders pattern](../h/head_and_shoulders_pattern.md) is a reversal pattern that signals the end of an uptrend. It consists of three peaks: a higher peak (head) between two lower peaks (shoulders).

The key levels include:
- Left Shoulder: The first peak, followed by a decline.
- Head: A higher peak, followed by a decline.
- Right Shoulder: A lower peak, followed by a decline.

When the price breaks below the neckline (the level connecting the lows of the troughs on either side of the head), it signals a [trend reversal](../t/trend_reversal.md).

### Double Top and Double Bottom

These are [reversal patterns](../r/reversal_patterns.md) that indicate a change in trend. The Double Top looks like an "M" and occurs after an uptrend. The price hits a high, retraces, and then hits a similar high before declining.

The Double Bottom looks like a "W" and occurs after a downtrend. The price hits a low, retraces, and then hits a similar low before rising.

## Volume Indicators

### On-Balance Volume (OBV)

OBV uses volume flow to predict changes in stock price. It is a cumulative total of volume by adding volume on up days and subtracting it on down days.

Example Calculation:
```
OBV = Previous OBV + Current Day's Volume [If closing price is higher than the previous day's closing price]
OBV = Previous OBV - Current Day's Volume [If closing price is lower than the previous day's closing price]
```

A rising OBV indicates increasing buying pressure, while a falling OBV indicates increasing selling pressure.

### Volume-Price Trend (VPT)

VPT measures the strength of a price trend by multiplying volume by the percentage change in price.

Example Calculation:
```
VPT = Previous VPT + (Volume * [(Current Close - Previous Close) / Previous Close])
```

A rising VPT line along with a price uptrend confirms the strength of the trend, while a diverging VPT indicates potential weakness.

## Advanced Technical Indicators

### Bollinger Bands

[Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md) consist of a middle band (usually a 20-day SMA) and two outer bands that are two standard deviations away from the middle band.

Example Parameters:
- Middle Band: 20-day SMA
- Upper Band: 20-day SMA + (2 * Standard Deviation)
- Lower Band: 20-day SMA - (2 * Standard Deviation)

Price movement toward the outer bands can indicate overbought or oversold conditions. The squeeze (when the bands are close together) indicates low volatility and potential breakout points.

### Ichimoku Cloud

The [Ichimoku Cloud](../i/ichimoku_cloud.md) provides information on [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels, momentum, and trend direction. It consists of five lines: Tenkan-sen, Kijun-sen, Senkou Span A, Senkou Span B, and Chikou Span.

Example Components:
- Tenkan-sen = (Highest High + Lowest Low) / 2 calculated over the last 9 periods
- Kijun-sen = (Highest High + Lowest Low) / 2 calculated over the last 26 periods
- Senkou Span A = (Tenkan-sen + Kijun-sen) / 2 plotted 26 periods ahead
- Senkou Span B = (Highest High + Lowest Low) / 2 calculated over the last 52 periods, plotted 26 periods ahead
- Chikou Span = Closing price plotted 26 periods back

The cloud, or Kumo, defines [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels, and crossovers between the price and the Kumo can indicate potential buy or sell signals.

## Algorithmic Implementation

Implementing [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) involves coding these indicators and strategies in programming languages such as Python, R, or using trading platforms like MetaTrader.

### Example in Python: SMA Crossover Strategy

Below is a simple example of implementing an SMA crossover strategy using Python and the pandas library.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import yfinance as yf

# Fetching historical data
data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2021-01-01', end='2022-01-01')
data['SMA_Short'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
data['SMA_Long'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Generating signals
data['Signal'] = 0
data['Signal'][50:] = np.where(data['SMA_Short'][50:] > data['SMA_Long'][50:], 1, -1)

# Trading strategy
data['Position'] = data['Signal'].shift()
data['Returns'] = data['Close'].pct_change()
data['Strategy_Returns'] = data['Returns'] * data['Position']

# Cumulative returns
cumulative_strategy_returns = (data['Strategy_Returns'] + 1).cumprod() - 1
print(cumulative_strategy_returns.tail(1))
```

### Example in R: RSI-Based Trading Strategy

Below is a simple example of implementing an RSI-based trading strategy using R and the quantmod package.

```R
library(quantmod)

# Fetching historical data
getSymbols("AAPL", src = "yahoo", from = "2021-01-01", to = "2022-01-01")
data <- Cl(AAPL)

# Calculating RSI
rsi <- RSI(data, n = 14)

# Generating signals
signal <- ifelse(rsi < 30, 1, ifelse(rsi > 70, -1, 0))

# Trading strategy
position <- Lag(signal)
returns <- diff(log(data))
strategy_returns <- returns * position

# Cumulative returns
cumulative_strategy_returns <- cumprod(1 + strategy_returns) - 1
print(tail(cumulative_strategy_returns, 1))
```

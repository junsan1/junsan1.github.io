# Title Insurance

Title [insurance](../i/insurance.md) is a form of [indemnity insurance](../i/indemnity_insurance.md) predominantly found in the United States, which insures against financial loss from defects in title to [real property](../r/real_property.md) and from the invalidity or unenforceability of [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) loans. The primary purpose of title [insurance](../i/insurance.md) is to protect an owner's or a [lender](../l/lender.md)'s financial [interest](../i/interest.md) in [real property](../r/real_property.md) against losses due to title defects, liens, or other issues with the property title.

## Overview

Title [insurance](../i/insurance.md) is unique among [insurance](../i/insurance.md) products in that it functions retroactively, [offering](../o/offering.md) protection against past events that could affect the future interests of property owners or lenders. Unlike other forms of [insurance](../i/insurance.md) which apply to future potential risks, title [insurance](../i/insurance.md) covers issues that occurred before the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) policy was purchased.

### Types of Title Insurance

There are two main types of title [insurance](../i/insurance.md) policies: Owner's Policy and [Lender](../l/lender.md)'s Policy.

#### Owner's Policy
An Owner's Policy protects the property buyer. It insures the buyer against title defects that could affect their ownership rights, such as errors in public records, unknown liens, or forged documents.

#### Lender's Policy
A [Lender](../l/lender.md)'s Policy, also known as a [loan](../l/loan.md) policy, is generally required by lenders when a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) is taken out on a property. It protects the [lender](../l/lender.md)’s [interest](../i/interest.md) in the property against title defects that could impair their [security](../s/security.md) [interest](../i/interest.md).

### Key Components of Title Insurance

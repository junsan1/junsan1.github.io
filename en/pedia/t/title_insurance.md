# Title Insurance

Title insurance is a form of indemnity insurance predominantly found in the United States, which insures against financial loss from defects in title to real property and from the invalidity or unenforceability of mortgage loans. The primary purpose of title insurance is to protect an owner's or a lender's financial interest in real property against losses due to title defects, liens, or other issues with the property title.

## Overview

Title insurance is unique among insurance products in that it functions retroactively, offering protection against past events that could affect the future interests of property owners or lenders. Unlike other forms of insurance which apply to future potential risks, title insurance covers issues that occurred before the insurance policy was purchased.

### Types of Title Insurance

There are two main types of title insurance policies: Owner's Policy and Lender's Policy.

#### Owner's Policy
An Owner's Policy protects the property buyer. It insures the buyer against title defects that could affect their ownership rights, such as errors in public records, unknown liens, or forged documents.

#### Lender's Policy
A Lender's Policy, also known as a loan policy, is generally required by lenders when a mortgage is taken out on a property. It protects the lender’s interest in the property against title defects that could impair their security interest.

### Key Components of Title Insurance

- **Title Search**: A thorough examination of public records to establish the history of the property’s title and identify any issues or defects.
- **Title Examination**: Analysis by a title company or attorney to confirm the property title's history and identify any issues.
- **Title Commitment**: A preliminary report providing information about the property's title status and outlining conditions that must be met for the policy to be issued.
- **Turnaround Time**: The period required to perform a title search and examination, typically lasting a few days to several weeks.
- **Premium**: A one-time fee paid at closing for acquiring title insurance.

### Coverage

Title insurance policies provide several types of coverage, including:

- **Defective Title**: Protection against defects like errors or omissions in deeds, mistakes in examining records, forgery, or undisclosed heirs.
- **Liens and Encumbrances**: Coverage for pre-existing liens or encumbrances that were not discovered during the initial title search.
- **Boundary Disputes and Survey Issues**: Protection against boundary disputes and issues arising from inaccurate surveys.

### Exclusions

While title insurance offers extensive protection, there are certain exclusions typically found in policies:

- **Known Issues**: Problems disclosed in the title commitment that are not corrected prior to the policy issue.
- **Governmental Regulations**: Issues related to zoning, land use, and other government regulations.
- **Boundary Discrepancies**: Disputes arising from property boundary lines unless specifically covered in an enhanced policy.
- **Illegal Practices**: Acts or interests arising post-policy that are illegal, fraudulent, or otherwise in violation of the law.

## Importance in Real Estate Transactions

Title insurance plays a crucial role in ensuring smooth and secure real estate transactions. It provides peace of mind for both buyers and lenders by mitigating financial risks associated with title defects.

- **Buyer Protection**: Ensures that buyers are acquiring a property free of legal encumbrances and defects.

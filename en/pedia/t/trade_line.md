# Trade Line

[Trade](../t/trade.md) lines, also known as "tradelines," are the accounts [listed](../l/listed.md) on a [credit report](../c/credit_report.md). These accounts could be [credit](../c/credit.md) cards, personal loans, auto loans, mortgages, or any other type of [credit](../c/credit.md) extended to an individual or a [business](../b/business.md) by a financial institution or [lender](../l/lender.md). Each tradeline contains detailed information about the account such as the [creditor](../c/creditor.md)'s name, the type of account, the balance, the [payment](../p/payment.md) history, and the account's status. In the context of a [credit report](../c/credit_report.md), tradelines play a critical role in determining one's [credit score](../c/credit_score.md) and overall [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md). 

## Importance in Credit Scoring

Tradelines are fundamental in the calculation of [credit](../c/credit.md) scores, such as the [FICO score](../f/fico_score.md) or [VantageScore](../v/vantagescore.md). These scores are used by lenders to assess the [risk](../r/risk.md) of lending [money](../m/money.md) to borrowers. Key elements from the tradelines that impact [credit](../c/credit.md) scores include:

1. **[Payment](../p/payment.md) History:** This is the most significant [factor](../f/factor.md) and tracks whether payments have been made on time.
2. **[Credit](../c/credit.md) Utilization:** This measures the ratio of the current balance to the [credit limit](../c/credit_limit.md) and ideally should be kept below 30%.
3. **Age of [Credit](../c/credit.md) Accounts:** Older accounts positively impact scores, indicating long-term, responsible [credit](../c/credit.md) use.
4. **Types of [Credit](../c/credit.md):** A mix of different types of [credit](../c/credit.md) (revolving, installment, etc.) can be beneficial to the [credit score](../c/credit_score.md).
5. **Recent [Credit](../c/credit.md) Inquiries:** Numerous recent hard inquiries can negatively impact a score as it may indicate [financial distress](../f/financial_distress.md) or high-[risk](../r/risk.md) behavior.

## Structure of a Tradeline

Each tradeline on a [credit report](../c/credit_report.md) includes [multiple](../m/multiple.md) fields that provide a detailed history of the [credit](../c/credit.md) account. Key components include:

- **[Lender](../l/lender.md) Information:** The name and contact information of the financial institution or [lender](../l/lender.md).
- **Account Type:** Describes whether the account is a [credit card](../c/credit_card.md), [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md), auto [loan](../l/loan.md), etc.
- **Account Status:** Indicates if the account is [open](../o/open.md), closed, or in collections.
- **Date Opened:** The month and year the account was initially opened.
- **[Credit Limit](../c/credit_limit.md) or [Loan](../l/loan.md) Amount:** The maximum amount that can be borrowed on the [credit](../c/credit.md) account.
- **Current Balance:** The outstanding balance currently owed.
- **[Payment](../p/payment.md) History:** A timeline of payments made, showing on-time payments, late payments, or missed payments.
- **Date of Last Activity:** Date of the most recent [transaction](../t/transaction.md) or update on the account.

## Types of Tradelines

There are several different types of tradelines that may appear on a [credit report](../c/credit_report.md):

1. **[Revolving Credit](../r/revolving_credit.md)**: Accounts like [credit](../c/credit.md) cards or lines of [credit](../c/credit.md), which allow the borrower to borrow up to a specified limit and repay over an indefinite period.
2. **Installment Loans**: Loans such as mortgages, auto loans, and student loans, which are repaid with regular installment payments over a specific period.
3. **[Open](../o/open.md) Accounts**: Accounts that must be paid in full each month, like charge cards.
4. **Retail Accounts**: Similar to [revolving credit](../r/revolving_credit.md) but typically offered by specific retail establishments and often used for purchasing goods on [credit](../c/credit.md) within that store or chain.

## Tradeline Management

4. **[Credit](../c/credit.md) Line Increases:** Requesting an increase in [credit limit](../c/credit_limit.md) on existing revolving accounts to decrease the utilization ratio.

# Tax-Deductible Interest

[Interest](../i/interest.md) is the cost of borrowing [money](../m/money.md), and it can be a significant [expense](../e/expense.md) for both individuals and businesses. Understanding what [interest](../i/interest.md) is tax-deductible and how to claim it can save [money](../m/money.md) and optimize financial strategies. Below, we explore various aspects of tax-deductible [interest](../i/interest.md), including its definition, the types of [interest](../i/interest.md) that may be deductible, specific rules and limitations, and how it applies to different entities such as individuals and businesses.

## Definition and Overview

Tax-deductible [interest](../i/interest.md) refers to the portion of [interest](../i/interest.md) payments on certain types of loans and debts that can be deducted from [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md), thereby reducing the overall [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md). The specifics of what [interest](../i/interest.md) is tax-deductible depend on the country's tax laws, and in this detailed explanation, we [will](../w/will.md) focus on U.S. tax law for illustrative purposes.

## Types of Tax-Deductible Interest

Several types of [interest](../i/interest.md) may be deductible, including:

### 1. Mortgage Interest

[Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) is one of the most common types of tax-deductible [interest](../i/interest.md) for individuals. Homeowners can deduct the [interest](../i/interest.md) paid on qualified [home](../h/home.md) loans, subject to certain conditions and limitations.

**Key Points:**
- **Qualified [Home](../h/home.md) Loans:** Includes mortgages for a primary residence and a second [home](../h/home.md).
- **[Loan](../l/loan.md) Amount Caps:** There are caps on the [loan](../l/loan.md) amount for which the [interest](../i/interest.md) is deductible. For loans taken out after December 15, 2017, [interest](../i/interest.md) on up to $750,000 of [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [debt](../d/debt.md) is deductible.
- **Points Paid:** Points paid to reduce the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) on the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) may also be deductible, subject to specific criteria.
- **[Home Equity](../h/home_equity.md) Loans:** [Interest](../i/interest.md) on [home equity](../h/home_equity.md) loans may be deductible if the [loan](../l/loan.md) is used to buy, build, or substantially improve the [home](../h/home.md) that secures the [loan](../l/loan.md).

### 2. Student Loan Interest

[Interest](../i/interest.md) paid on student loans used for qualified education expenses may be tax-deductible.

**Key Points:**
- **[Income](../i/income.md) Limitations:** There are [income](../i/income.md) phase-out ranges that limit the [deduction](../d/deduction.md) for higher-[income](../i/income.md) taxpayers.
- **Maximum [Deduction](../d/deduction.md):** The maximum [deduction](../d/deduction.md) is $2,500 per year.
- **Qualified Loans:** The [loan](../l/loan.md) must be taken out solely to pay for qualified education expenses.

### 3. Investment Interest

Individuals who borrow [money](../m/money.md) to invest in property that generates [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md), such as [stocks](../s/stock.md) or bonds, may deduct the [interest](../i/interest.md) as an investment [interest expense](../i/interest_expense.md).

**Key Points:**
- **[Deduction](../d/deduction.md) Limit:** The [deduction](../d/deduction.md) is limited to the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md)'s net [investment income](../i/investment_income.md) for the year.
- **Carryforward:** Any disallowed investment [interest expense](../i/interest_expense.md) can be carried forward to future years.

### 4. Business Interest

Businesses can generally deduct [interest](../i/interest.md) paid on [business](../b/business.md) loans.

**Key Points:**
- **[Business](../b/business.md) Purpose:** The [loan](../l/loan.md) must be directly related to the [business](../b/business.md) operations.
- **[Interest](../i/interest.md) Limitation Rules:** Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, [interest](../i/interest.md) deductions may be limited for larger businesses, generally limiting the [deduction](../d/deduction.md) to 30% of adjusted [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md).
- **CarryForward Rules:** Disallowed [interest](../i/interest.md) can be carried forward.

## Rules and Limitations

Tax-deductible [interest](../i/interest.md) is subject to various rules and limitations, some of which include:

### 1. Documentation

Proper documentation is essential for claiming [interest](../i/interest.md) deductions. Taxpayers must provide documentation, such as [loan](../l/loan.md) agreements, statements showing the amount of [interest](../i/interest.md) paid, and proof of the use of [loan](../l/loan.md) proceeds.

### 2. Loan Purposes

[Interest](../i/interest.md) is generally deductible if the [loan](../l/loan.md) proceeds are used for a deductible purpose. Personal [interest](../i/interest.md), such as [interest](../i/interest.md) on [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) [debt](../d/debt.md) used for personal expenses, is usually not deductible.

### 3. Itemized Deductions

For individuals, some [interest](../i/interest.md) deductions, such as [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [interest](../i/interest.md), may only be claimed if the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) itemizes deductions on Schedule A of Form 1040.

### 4. Limitations Based on Income

Some [interest](../i/interest.md) deductions, such as student [loan](../l/loan.md) [interest](../i/interest.md), are subject to [income](../i/income.md) limitations that may phase them out entirely for higher-[income](../i/income.md) taxpayers.

### 5. Calculation Methods

Various calculation methods apply for different types of [interest](../i/interest.md) deductions. For example, calculating investment [interest expense](../i/interest_expense.md) requires determining net [investment income](../i/investment_income.md).

## Practical Applications

### Individual Taxpayers

For individual taxpayers, understanding and properly applying [interest](../i/interest.md) deductions is crucial for optimizing tax savings. Below are practical steps to consider:

1. **Review [Loan](../l/loan.md) Agreements:** Identify [interest](../i/interest.md) payments related to qualified loans such as mortgages, student loans, and investment loans.
2. **Keep Records:** Maintain documentation for all [interest](../i/interest.md) payments and the use of [loan](../l/loan.md) proceeds.

1. **Identify [Business](../b/business.md) Loans:** Ensure the [interest](../i/interest.md) on loans taken out for [business](../b/business.md) purposes is properly recorded.

3. **Documentation and Compliance:** Maintain thorough documentation and ensure compliance with tax regulations to avoid disallowed [interest](../i/interest.md) deductions.

## Changes in Tax Laws

### Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA)

# Triangle Patterns

In the realm of trading, [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) serves as a significant tool for traders to forecast future price movements based on historical data. Among various [chart patterns](../c/chart_patterns.md) that traders analyze, [triangle](../t/triangle.md) patterns [hold](../h/hold.md) a special place due to their frequent occurrence and reliable predictive power. [Triangle](../t/triangle.md) patterns are considered [continuation patterns](../c/continuation_patterns.md), which means they suggest that the existing [trend](../t/trend.md) is likely to continue once the pattern is complete. However, they can also indicate potential reversals, which adds an element of complexity to their interpretation. This document provides an exhaustive look at [triangle](../t/triangle.md) patterns in trading, their types, formation, significance, and how to effectively [trade](../t/trade.md) them.

### What are Triangle Patterns?

[Triangle](../t/triangle.md) patterns are a form of chart pattern used in [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) that depict a pause in the prevailing [trend](../t/trend.md) followed by a potential continuation. They are formed when the price of an [asset](../a/asset.md) makes smaller and smaller swings over time, creating a triangular shape on the chart. Traders look at these patterns to make informed decisions about entering or exiting positions based on the anticipated price movements.

### Types of Triangle Patterns

[Triangle](../t/triangle.md) patterns are generally classified into three main categories:

1. **Symmetrical [Triangle](../t/triangle.md)**
2. **[Ascending Triangle](../a/ascending_triangle.md)**
3. **[Descending Triangle](../d/descending_triangle.md)**

#### Symmetrical Triangle

A symmetrical [triangle](../t/triangle.md) is formed when the price consolidates in such a way that it creates two converging trendlines with similar slopes. The upper [trendline](../t/trendline.md) connects the series of lower highs, and the lower [trendline](../t/trendline.md) connects the series of higher lows. The result is a symmetrical, or [triangle](../t/triangle.md)-like, pattern.

Key features of Symmetrical Triangles:
- Both trendlines (resistance and support) slope towards each other.
- The pattern typically forms during a period of [consolidation](../c/consolidation.md) before the price breaks out.
- [Volume](../v/volume.md) usually decreases during the formation and increases during the [breakout](../b/breakout.md).

How to Identify:
- Identify at least two highs and two lows that are moving towards each other.
- Draw trendlines to connect the highs and the lows.

[Trading Strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md):
- Enter a [trade](../t/trade.md) when the price breaks out from the symmetrical [triangle](../t/triangle.md) in the direction of the existing [trend](../t/trend.md).
- Place a [stop-loss order](../s/stop-loss_order.md) just outside the opposite side of the [triangle](../t/triangle.md) to protect against false breakouts.
- Measure the height of the [triangle](../t/triangle.md) at its widest point and project that distance from the [breakout](../b/breakout.md) point to set a target price.

#### Ascending Triangle

An [ascending triangle](../a/ascending_triangle.md) is a bullish pattern that signifies an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md). It is formed by a horizontal resistance line (peaks) and an upward sloping support line (higher lows). This pattern indicates that buyers are gradually gaining strength, as they are able to push the price higher each time it falls to the support line.

Key features of Ascending Triangles:
- The resistance line remains flat while the support line slopes upwards.
- The pattern generally forms during an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md) as a continuation pattern.
- [Volume](../v/volume.md) typically decreases as the pattern forms and increases on the [breakout](../b/breakout.md).

How to Identify:
- Identify a flat-top resistance through at least two highs.
- Identify a rising support line through at least two lows.

[Trading Strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md):
- Enter a [trade](../t/trade.md) when the price breaks above the horizontal resistance line.
- Place a [stop-loss order](../s/stop-loss_order.md) slightly below the ascending support line.
- Project the height of the [triangle](../t/triangle.md) from the [breakout](../b/breakout.md) point to set a target price.

#### Descending Triangle

A [descending triangle](../d/descending_triangle.md) has the opposite structure of an [ascending triangle](../a/ascending_triangle.md) and is considered bearish. It is identified by a horizontal support line (troughs) and a downward sloping resistance line (lower highs). This pattern suggests that sellers are overpowering buyers as they manage to push the price lower each time it rallies to the resistance line.

Key features of Descending Triangles:
- The support line remains flat while the resistance line slopes downwards.
- The pattern generally forms during a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md) as a continuation pattern.
- [Volume](../v/volume.md) usually diminishes during the formation and spikes during the [breakout](../b/breakout.md).

How to Identify:
- Identify a flat-bottom support through at least two lows.
- Identify a falling resistance line through at least two highs.

[Trading Strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md):
- Enter a [trade](../t/trade.md) when the price breaks below the horizontal support line.
- Place a [stop-loss order](../s/stop-loss_order.md) slightly above the descending resistance line.
- Project the height of the [triangle](../t/triangle.md) from the [breakout](../b/breakout.md) point to set a target price.

### Importance of Volume in Triangle Patterns

[Volume](../v/volume.md) plays a crucial role in confirming the validity of [triangle](../t/triangle.md) patterns. Generally, [volume](../v/volume.md) tends to decrease as the pattern forms, indicating a period of [consolidation](../c/consolidation.md) or indecision. However, when the price breaks out of the [triangle](../t/triangle.md), traders look for a significant increase in [volume](../v/volume.md) to confirm the [breakout](../b/breakout.md)'s legitimacy. Low [volume](../v/volume.md) breakouts are more prone to failure, which means the anticipated [trend](../t/trend.md) continuation or [reversal](../r/reversal.md) may not occur.

### False Breakouts

One of the challenges in trading [triangle](../t/triangle.md) patterns is dealing with false breakouts. A [false breakout](../f/false_breakout.md) occurs when the price breaks through the [trendline](../t/trendline.md) but fails to sustain the movement, resulting in a [reversal](../r/reversal.md) back into the [triangle](../t/triangle.md). False breakouts can lead to losses if not properly managed. To mitigate this [risk](../r/risk.md), traders can employ the following strategies:
- Wait for a [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) close beyond the [trendline](../t/trendline.md) before entering a [trade](../t/trade.md).
- Use [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md) to protect against unexpected reversals.
- Combine [triangle](../t/triangle.md) pattern analysis with other [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) for confirmation.

### Combining with Other Indicators

While [triangle](../t/triangle.md) patterns are powerful on their own, combining them with other [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) can enhance their reliability. Some popular indicators include:
- **Moving Averages:** Moving averages can help identify the overall [trend](../t/trend.md) direction. A crossover of moving averages can provide additional confirmation for entering or exiting trades.
- **[Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (RSI):** RSI can indicate [overbought](../o/overbought.md) or [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions, helping traders avoid entering trades just as a [trend](../t/trend.md) is about to reverse.
- **MACD (Moving Average Convergence [Divergence](../d/divergence.md)):** MACD can provide insights into [momentum](../m/momentum.md) and potential [trend](../t/trend.md) reversals, complementing the signals from [triangle](../t/triangle.md) patterns.

### Practical Example: Trading a Symmetrical Triangle with Moving Averages

Let's walk through an example of trading a symmetrical [triangle](../t/triangle.md) pattern with the help of moving averages.

1. **Identify the [Triangle](../t/triangle.md) Pattern:**
   - On the price chart, identify at least two highs and two lows converging to form a symmetrical [triangle](../t/triangle.md).

2. **Confirm with Moving Averages:**
   - Add a 50-period and a 200-period moving average to the chart.
   - Ensure that the moving averages are aligned with the prevailing [trend](../t/trend.md). For instance, if the [50-period moving average](../1/50-period_moving_average.md) is above the 200-period moving average, the [trend](../t/trend.md) is bullish.

3. **Monitor [Volume](../v/volume.md):**
   - Observe the [volume](../v/volume.md) as the [triangle](../t/triangle.md) pattern forms. Ideally, it should decrease, indicating [consolidation](../c/consolidation.md).

4. **Entering the [Trade](../t/trade.md):**
   - Wait for a [breakout](../b/breakout.md) from the symmetrical [triangle](../t/triangle.md). If the price breaks above the upper [trendline](../t/trendline.md), it confirms a bullish [breakout](../b/breakout.md).
   - Place a buy [order](../o/order.md) just above the [breakout](../b/breakout.md) point.

5. **Setting Stop-Loss and Target:**
   - Place a [stop-loss order](../s/stop-loss_order.md) just below the lower [trendline](../t/trendline.md) to protect against false breakouts.
   - Measure the height of the [triangle](../t/triangle.md) at its widest point and project it from the [breakout](../b/breakout.md) point to set a target price.

By combining the symmetrical [triangle](../t/triangle.md) pattern with moving averages, traders can [gain](../g/gain.md) more confidence in their [trade](../t/trade.md) decisions and improve the likelihood of success.

### Conclusion

[Triangle](../t/triangle.md) patterns are valuable tools in the arsenal of technical traders. Whether symmetrical, ascending, or descending, these patterns provide insights into potential price movements that can help traders make informed decisions. By understanding how to identify and [trade](../t/trade.md) [triangle](../t/triangle.md) patterns while considering [volume](../v/volume.md), false breakouts, and additional [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md), traders can enhance their proficiency in [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) and increase their chances of trading success.

## What is Tax Liability?

## Categories of Tax Liability

For corporations, it includes all profits generated from [business activities](../b/business_activities.md).

### 2. Payroll Tax Liability

### 3. Sales Tax Liability

### 4. Property Tax Liability

[Property tax](../p/property_tax.md) is levied on [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) based on the [value](../v/value.md) of the property. This is often collected by local governments.

The rates can vary depending on whether the [asset](../a/asset.md) is held short-term or long-term.

## Calculating Tax Liability

The process of calculating tax [liability](../l/liability.md) is intricate and depends on various factors including [income](../i/income.md) level, type of [income](../i/income.md), applicable tax rates, deductions, and credits. Here are the basic steps:

1. **Determine [Gross Income](../g/gross_income.md):** Begin with all sources of [income](../i/income.md).
2. **Adjust [Gross Income](../g/gross_income.md):** Apply any adjustments to [income](../i/income.md) to reach Adjusted [Gross Income](../g/gross_income.md) (AGI).
3. **Subtract Deductions:** Deduct either the [standard deduction](../s/standard_deduction.md) or itemized deductions from AGI.
4. **Apply Tax Rates:** Use the applicable [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md) schedules based on the [filing status](../f/filing_status.md) (single, [married filing jointly](../m/married_filing_jointly.md), etc.) to compute preliminary tax [liability](../l/liability.md).
5. **Subtract Credits:** Apply any tax credits to further reduce the tax [liability](../l/liability.md).
6. **Add Other [Taxes](../t/taxes.md):** Include any additional [taxes](../t/taxes.md) such as [self-employment](../s/self-employment.md) tax, alternative minimum tax, etc.

## Methods to Manage and Reduce Tax Liability

There are numerous strategies to manage and reduce tax [liability](../l/liability.md):

- **Tax Deductions:** Reducing [gross income](../g/gross_income.md) through allowable deductions such as [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [interest](../i/interest.md), state [taxes](../t/taxes.md), and charitable donations.
- **Tax Credits:** Utilizing credits like the [Earned Income](../e/earned_income.md) [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md) (EITC), [Child Tax Credit](../c/child_tax_credit.md), and education credits.
- **Retirement Contributions:** Contributions to retirement accounts such as 401(k)s and IRAs can reduce [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md).
- **[Capital](../c/capital.md) Losses:** Offsetting [capital](../c/capital.md) gains with [capital](../c/capital.md) losses to lower [capital gains tax](../c/capital_gains_tax.md) [liability](../l/liability.md).
- **[Tax-Deferred](../t/tax_deferred.md) Accounts:** Utilizing [tax-deferred](../t/tax_deferred.md) investment accounts can delay the tax [liability](../l/liability.md).

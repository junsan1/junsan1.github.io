# Taxable Income

Taxable [income](../i/income.md) refers to the portion of an individual’s or a company’s [income](../i/income.md) that is subject to [income tax](../i/income_tax.md) by the government. It encompasses all [income](../i/income.md) sources, including wages, salaries, bonuses, [interest](../i/interest.md), and dividends, but allows for deductions and exemptions to arrive at the net amount that is subject to [taxation](../t/taxation.md). Understanding taxable [income](../i/income.md) is paramount for both individuals and businesses as it determines the final [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md). Here, we’ll delve into various aspects of taxable [income](../i/income.md), providing a comprehensive overview.

## Sources of Taxable Income

### Wages and Salaries

For the majority of individuals, wages and salaries constitute the [principal](../p/principal.md) source of taxable [income](../i/income.md). This includes not only the [base pay](../b/base_pay.md) but also bonuses, commissions, and tips. In the United States, employers are required to withhold federal and state [income](../i/income.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) from employees’ paychecks based on the information provided on Form W-4.

### Business Income

For self-employed individuals and [business](../b/business.md) owners, profits from a [business](../b/business.md) operational activity are considered taxable [income](../i/income.md). This is calculated as total [revenue](../r/revenue.md) minus allowable [business](../b/business.md) expenses. Types of [business](../b/business.md) entities, such as sole proprietorships, partnerships, and corporations, each have specific tax reporting requirements.

### Investment Income

[Investment income](../i/investment_income.md) includes [earnings](../e/earnings.md) from various investment vehicles such as [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), and mutual funds. This [income](../i/income.md) can take several forms:
- **[Interest](../i/interest.md) [Income](../i/income.md):** [Earnings](../e/earnings.md) from savings accounts, certificates of [deposit](../d/deposit.md) (CDs), and bonds.
- **[Dividend](../d/dividend.md) [Income](../i/income.md):** Periodic payments received from [equity](../e/equity.md) investments in corporations.
- **[Capital](../c/capital.md) Gains:** Profits from the [sale](../s/sale.md) of assets or investments, which can be short-term (held for less than a year) or long-term (held for more than a year).

### Rental Income

[Income](../i/income.md) received from renting out property is also taxable. Landlords can deduct specific expenses related to the upkeep and management of the rental property to reduce their taxable rental [income](../i/income.md).

### Retirement Income

Distributions from retirement accounts such as 401(k)s, IRAs, and pensions contribute to taxable [income](../i/income.md). The extent of [taxation](../t/taxation.md) depends on whether these contributions were made with pre-tax or post-tax dollars.

## Deductions and Exemptions

### Standard Deduction

The [standard deduction](../s/standard_deduction.md) is a fixed dollar amount that reduces the [income](../i/income.md) on which you are taxed. The Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Service (IRS) adjusts this figure annually for [inflation](../i/inflation.md). In the U.S., the [standard deduction](../s/standard_deduction.md) varies depending on [filing status](../f/filing_status.md) (single, [married filing jointly](../m/married_filing_jointly.md), [head of household](../h/head_of_household.md)).

### Itemized Deductions

Itemized deductions allow taxpayers to deduct various eligible expenses from their taxable [income](../i/income.md). Common itemized deductions include:
- **Medical and Dental Expenses:** Expenses exceeding a certain percentage of adjusted [gross income](../g/gross_income.md) (AGI).
- **State and Local [Taxes](../t/taxes.md):** Including property [taxes](../t/taxes.md) and [income](../i/income.md) or sales [taxes](../t/taxes.md).
- **[Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [Interest](../i/interest.md):** [Interest](../i/interest.md) paid on [home](../h/home.md) loans.
- **Charitable Contributions:** Donations to qualified organizations.

### Personal Exemptions

Historically, personal exemptions allowed taxpayers to deduct a specific amount for each [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) and dependent claimed on the [tax return](../t/tax_return.md). However, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated personal exemptions until at least 2025.

## Tax Credits

Unlike deductions, which reduce taxable [income](../i/income.md), tax credits directly reduce the amount of tax owed. Examples of popular tax credits include:
- **[Earned Income](../e/earned_income.md) [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md) (EITC):** For low to moderate-[income](../i/income.md) workers.
- **[Child Tax Credit](../c/child_tax_credit.md):** For each qualifying child under a certain age.
- **Education Credits:** Such as the American Opportunity [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md) (AOTC) and the [Lifetime Learning Credit](../l/lifetime_learning_credit.md) (LLC).

## Adjustments to Income

Adjustments to [income](../i/income.md), also known as “above-the-line” deductions, are subtracted from [gross income](../g/gross_income.md) to calculate AGI. Common adjustments include:
- **Retirement Contributions:** To traditional IRAs or self-employed retirement plans.
- **Health Savings Accounts (HSAs):** Contributions to HSAs.
- **Student [Loan](../l/loan.md) [Interest](../i/interest.md):** Deductible [interest](../i/interest.md) paid on qualified student loans.

## Tax Brackets and Rates

Taxable [income](../i/income.md) is subject to tax according to the [tax brackets](../t/tax_brackets.md) and rates established by the government. In [progressive tax](../p/progressive_tax.md) systems like that of the U.S., [income](../i/income.md) is taxed at increasing rates as [income](../i/income.md) rises:
- **[Federal Income](../f/federal_income.md) Tax Rates:** The U.S. has a seven-bracket system, with rates ranging from 10% to 37% as of 2021.
- **State [Income](../i/income.md) [Taxes](../t/taxes.md):** Each state may have its own tax system ranging from no [income tax](../i/income_tax.md) to flat or [progressive tax](../p/progressive_tax.md) rates.

## Filing Status

An individual’s taxable [income](../i/income.md) can vary significantly based on their [filing status](../f/filing_status.md), which is used to determine eligibility for various deductions and credits. Common filing statuses include:
- **Single:** Individual not married at the end of the tax year.
- **[Married Filing Jointly](../m/married_filing_jointly.md):** Married couple filing a combined [return](../r/return.md).
- **[Married Filing Separately](../m/married_filing_separately.md):** Married individuals filing separate returns.
- **[Head of Household](../h/head_of_household.md):** Unmarried individual supporting a dependent.
- **Qualifying Widow(er):** Surviving spouse with a dependent child.

## Special Considerations

### Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)

The AMT is an alternative tax system designed to ensure that high-[income](../i/income.md) individuals and corporations pay a minimum level of tax. It recalculates [income tax](../i/income_tax.md) after adding certain tax preference items to regular taxable [income](../i/income.md).

### Taxable vs. Nontaxable Income

Some [income](../i/income.md) is not subject to tax and must be distinguished from taxable [income](../i/income.md). Examples include:
- **Gifts and Inheritances:** Generally, not taxable to the recipient.
- **[Life Insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) Proceeds:** Not taxable if received due to the death of the insured.
- **[Municipal Bond](../m/municipal_bond.md) [Interest](../i/interest.md):** [Interest](../i/interest.md) earned on bonds issued by state and local governments is typically [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md).

### Strategies for Managing Taxable Income

[Tax planning](../t/tax_planning.md) strategies aim to minimize taxable [income](../i/income.md) and maximize available deductions and credits. Strategies include:
- **Retirement Account Contributions:** Utilize [tax-advantaged](../t/tax-advantaged.md) retirement accounts.
- **[Tax Loss Harvesting](../t/tax_loss_harvesting.md):** Offsetting [capital](../c/capital.md) gains with [capital](../c/capital.md) losses.
- **Charitable Giving:** Donating appreciated assets to reduce [capital](../c/capital.md) gains [taxes](../t/taxes.md).
- **[Income](../i/income.md) Shifting:** Shifting [income](../i/income.md) to family members in lower [tax brackets](../t/tax_brackets.md).

## Conclusion

Understanding taxable [income](../i/income.md) is crucial for efficient [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md) and compliance with tax regulations. By being aware of various sources of [income](../i/income.md), deductions, adjustments, and credits, individuals and businesses can optimize their tax liabilities and make informed financial decisions. Accurate record-keeping and staying informed about changing tax laws [will](../w/will.md) further ensure that taxpayers fully understand their [obligations](../o/obligation.md) and opportunities within the regulatory framework.

# Tier 1 Common Capital Ratio

The Tier 1 Common [Capital](../c/capital.md) Ratio is a financial metric used primarily by banks to measure their core [equity](../e/equity.md) [capital](../c/capital.md) compared to their total [risk-weighted assets](../r/risk-weighted_assets.md). This ratio is a vital component in assessing a [bank](../b/bank.md)'s [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and its ability to absorb losses in times of financial stress. It emerged from the [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md) accords, a global, voluntary regulatory framework on [bank capital](../b/bank_capital.md) adequacy, [stress testing](../s/stress_testing.md), and [market](../m/market.md) [liquidity risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md).

## Core Components

1. **Core [Equity](../e/equity.md) [Capital](../c/capital.md)**: Also referred to as "Common [Equity](../e/equity.md) Tier 1 (CET1) [Capital](../c/capital.md)," this consists mainly of common [shares](../s/shares.md), [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md), and reserves. It is the highest quality of [capital](../c/capital.md) as it is fully available to absorb losses.

2. **[Risk-Weighted Assets](../r/risk-weighted_assets.md) (RWA)**: These are a [bank](../b/bank.md)’s assets [weighted](../w/weighted.md) by [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) according to a formula determined by regulatory authorities. Different types of assets are given different weights based on their [risk](../r/risk.md) profile. For instance, loans to other financial institutions may have a lower [risk](../r/risk.md)-weight compared to consumer loans.

## Importance of the Ratio

The Tier 1 Common [Capital](../c/capital.md) Ratio plays a critical role in several areas:

- **Regulatory Requirement**: Banks are required to maintain a minimum level of this ratio. As of [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md) guidelines, the minimum required Tier 1 Common [Capital](../c/capital.md) Ratio is 4.5%. Regulatory bodies like the Federal Reserve in the United States may set their own requirements above this minimum.
  
- **Financial Stability**: A higher ratio suggests a higher capacity for a [bank](../b/bank.md) to withstand financial shocks without threatening its [solvency](../s/solvency.md). 

- **[Investor](../i/investor.md) Confidence**: Investors look at this ratio as an [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of a [bank](../b/bank.md)’s financial robustness. A higher ratio can lead to increased [investor](../i/investor.md) confidence.

## Calculating Tier 1 Common Capital Ratio

\[ \text{Tier 1 Common Capital Ratio} = \frac{\text{Common Equity Tier 1 Capital}}{\text{[Risk-Weighted Assets](../r/risk-weighted_assets.md)}} \]

Where:
- **Common [Equity](../e/equity.md) [Tier 1 Capital](../t/tier_1_capital.md) (CET1)** includes [common stock](../c/common_stock.md), [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md), and other [comprehensive income](../c/comprehensive_income.md).
- **[Risk-Weighted Assets](../r/risk-weighted_assets.md) (RWA)** are calculated by assigning different [risk](../r/risk.md) weights to different [asset](../a/asset.md) categories.

### Example Calculation

Let's assume a [bank](../b/bank.md) has CET1 [Capital](../c/capital.md) of $50 million and RWAs of $400 million. The Tier 1 Common [Capital](../c/capital.md) Ratio would be:

\[ \frac{ 50\text{ million} }{ 400\text{ million} } = 0.125 \text{ or } 12.5\% \]

This 12.5% ratio is well above any regulatory minimums, suggesting strong [capital](../c/capital.md) adequacy.

## Basel III and the Ratio

[Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md) introduced several enhancements to the existing regulatory framework with a strong emphasis on improving the quality of regulatory [capital](../c/capital.md). Key [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md) reforms include:

- **Higher [Capital](../c/capital.md) Requirements**: Increased the minimum Tier 1 Common [Capital](../c/capital.md) Ratio from 2.5% (under [Basel II](../b/basel_ii.md)) to 4.5%.
- **[Capital](../c/capital.md) Conservation Buffer**: Introduced an additional buffer of 2.5%, effectively increasing the ratio requirement to 7%.
- **Countercyclical Buffer**: Up to an additional 2.5% during periods of high [credit](../c/credit.md) growth.

## Key Components of CET1 Capital

1. **Common [Shares](../s/shares.md)**: [Equity](../e/equity.md) [shares](../s/shares.md) that represent ownership in the company.
2. **[Retained Earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md)**: Profits that have been reinvested into the company rather than paid out as dividends.
3. **Other Reserves**: Includes items like the [surplus](../s/surplus.md) of share [premium](../p/premium.md) and other eligible reserves.

## Challenges in Maintaining the Ratio

1. **Economic Downturns**: Adverse [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md) can erode [asset](../a/asset.md) quality, thereby increasing RWAs and reducing the ratio.
2. **Regulatory Changes**: Changes in regulations can affect the calculation of CET1 and RWAs.
3. **Operational Risks**: Unforeseen events like [fraud](../f/fraud.md) or management failures can impact a [bank](../b/bank.md)'s [capital](../c/capital.md) negatively.

## Global Examples

### JP Morgan Chase

JP Morgan Chase maintains a strong Tier 1 Common [Capital](../c/capital.md) Ratio as part of its [robust](../r/robust.md) [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) framework. More information can be found on their [Investor Relations page](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/ir).

### HSBC

HSBC also keeps track of its Tier 1 Common [Capital](../c/capital.md) Ratio to ensure compliance with global regulatory standards. Detailed [capital](../c/capital.md) adequacy metrics are available on their [Investor Relations website](https://www.hsbc.com/investors).

## Conclusion

The Tier 1 Common [Capital](../c/capital.md) Ratio is instrumental in ensuring the stability and [solvency](../s/solvency.md) of banks. It provides a clear [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of a [bank](../b/bank.md)'s ability to withstand financial challenges by maintaining adequate [capital](../c/capital.md) reserves. As global financial environments become increasingly complex, the role of such regulatory measures becomes even more critical in maintaining systemic stability and safeguarding the interests of depositors and investors.

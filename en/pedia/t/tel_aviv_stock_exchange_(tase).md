# Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE)

The Tel Aviv Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (TASE), located in Tel Aviv, Israel, is one of the primary stock exchanges in the Middle East and serves as a fundamental cornerstone of the Israeli [economy](../e/economy.md). TASE facilitates the trading of various financial instruments including [stocks](../s/stock.md), corporate bonds, government bonds, [exchange](../e/exchange.md)-traded funds (ETFs), and [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) such as [options](../o/options.md) and [futures](../f/futures.md).

## History and Development

TASE was established in 1953, evolving from the informal arrangements of trading in securities that took place in the early days of Israel's independence. The organization was initially created to serve as a centralized and regulated marketplace for trading financial securities, addressing the need for transparent pricing and regulatory oversight. Over the decades, TASE has grown significantly in terms of both the number and [value](../v/value.md) of securities traded.

TASE has consistently modernized its [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) and [trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md) to meet international standards and practices. One of the notable milestones was the implementation of the Tel Aviv Continuous Trading (TACT) system in 1997, which enabled continuous trading throughout the trading day.

# Tracker Fund

A tracker [fund](../f/fund.md), also known as an [index fund](../i/index_fund.md), is a type of [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md) or [exchange](../e/exchange.md)-traded [fund](../f/fund.md) (ETF) designed to replicate the performance of a specific [index](../i/index_instrument.md). These funds are constructed to track the components of a [market index](../m/market_index.md), such as the S&P 500, FTSE 100, or other recognized benchmarks, with the objective of matching their returns as closely as possible.

## What is a Tracker Fund?

A tracker [fund](../f/fund.md) is a passive [investment vehicle](../i/investment_vehicle.md) that aims to mirror the performance of a particular [index](../i/index_instrument.md). This is in contrast to actively managed funds, where [fund](../f/fund.md) managers make decisions on which securities to buy and sell in an attempt to [outperform](../o/outperform.md) the [market](../m/market.md). In a tracker [fund](../f/fund.md), the [fund manager](../f/fund_manager.md)'s role is mostly limited to ensuring that the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s portfolio closely matches the composition of the chosen [index](../i/index_instrument.md).

### Characteristics of Tracker Funds

- **Passivity**: The primary goal is to replicate the performance of an [index](../i/index_instrument.md) rather than [outperform](../o/outperform.md) it.
- **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: By replicating an entire [index](../i/index_instrument.md), tracker funds [offer](../o/offer.md) broad [market exposure](../m/market_exposure.md) and diversify [risk](../r/risk.md) across various sectors and securities.
- **Lower Costs**: Because they are passively managed, tracker funds generally have lower management fees compared to actively managed funds.
- **[Transparency](../t/transparency.md)**: Since the [holdings](../h/holdings.md) of the [fund](../f/fund.md) reflect the [index](../i/index_instrument.md), investors have a clear understanding of what securities are included in the portfolio.

## How Tracker Funds Work

Tracker funds follow the construction of their target [index](../i/index_instrument.md) as closely as possible. Here's how they generally operate:

### Fund Creation and Management

1. **[Index](../i/index_instrument.md) Selection**: The first step is selecting an [index](../i/index_instrument.md) that the [fund](../f/fund.md) [will](../w/will.md) track. This could be a broad [market index](../m/market_index.md) like the S&P 500 or a sector-specific [index](../i/index_instrument.md).

2. **Duplication of [Holdings](../h/holdings.md)**: The [fund manager](../f/fund_manager.md) purchases the securities that make up the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) in the same proportions. If the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) undergoes changes, the [fund manager](../f/fund_manager.md) adjusts the [holdings](../h/holdings.md) accordingly.

3. **[Rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md)**: Indices periodically rebalance, meaning they add or remove certain securities or adjust the weightings of existing securities. Tracker funds adjust their portfolios to mirror these changes.

### Trade Execution

1. **[Market](../m/market.md) Orders**: When an [investor](../i/investor.md) buys [shares](../s/shares.md) in a tracker [fund](../f/fund.md), the [fund](../f/fund.md) itself typically buys [shares](../s/shares.md) of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md) securities to reflect this investment.
 
2. **Dividends and [Income](../i/income.md)**: If the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) securities pay dividends, these are usually passed on to the tracker [fund](../f/fund.md)'s investors, either as additional [shares](../s/shares.md) or cash.

3. **[Expense Ratio](../e/expense_ratio.md)**: While tracker funds have lower costs, they still incur some expenses, such as management fees, administrative costs, and trading commissions. These are represented by the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s [expense ratio](../e/expense_ratio.md), which is a percentage of the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s average assets.

4. **[Tracking Error](../t/tracking_error.md)**: This is the difference between the performance of the tracker [fund](../f/fund.md) and the performance of the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) it aims to replicate. A lower [tracking error](../t/tracking_error.md) indicates a better-performing tracker [fund](../f/fund.md).

## Examples of Tracker Funds

### Vanguard 500 Index Fund (VFINX)

One of the earliest and most well-known tracker funds is the Vanguard 500 [Index Fund](../i/index_fund.md), which aims to replicate the performance of the S&P 500 [index](../i/index_instrument.md). Vanguard is renowned for its low-cost [index](../i/index_instrument.md) funds and this particular [fund](../f/fund.md) is popular among investors because of its [diversification](../d/diversification.md) and low fees.

### SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)

SPY is another prominent tracker [fund](../f/fund.md) that aims to mirror the performance of the S&P 500. It is an ETF, meaning it trades like a stock on the stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md), [offering](../o/offering.md) high [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and allowing investors to buy and sell throughout the trading day.

### iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM)

This ETF is designed to track the performance of the MSCI Emerging Markets [Index](../i/index_instrument.md), which includes companies from emerging economies across the globe. It provides investors with exposure to growth markets that have higher risks but also potentially higher rewards.

### Fidelity ZERO Large Cap Index Fund (FNILX)

A unique [offering](../o/offering.md) from Fidelity, this tracker [fund](../f/fund.md) aims to replicate the Fidelity U.S. Large Cap [Index](../i/index_instrument.md). It is noted for having zero management fees, making it an attractive option for cost-conscious investors.

## Advantages of Tracker Funds

### Cost Efficiency

One of the most significant benefits of tracker funds is their cost [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md). The reduced need for [active management](../a/active_management.md) and research means that these funds can [offer](../o/offer.md) lower [expense](../e/expense.md) ratios, which benefits investors by keeping more of their returns.

### Simplified Investment

Tracker funds provide an easy way to [gain](../g/gain.md) broad [market exposure](../m/market_exposure.md) without requiring the [investor](../i/investor.md) to actively manage their portfolio or make extensive individual stock selections.

### Risk Diversification

By holding a diversified set of securities, tracker funds spread [risk](../r/risk.md) across various industries and companies, reducing the potential impact of poor performance by any single [security](../s/security.md).

### Consistent Performance

Given that tracker funds aim to replicate an [index](../i/index_instrument.md) rather than [outperform](../o/outperform.md) it, investors often find them to have more predictable and consistent performance over time. This can provide a level of stability in an otherwise volatile [market](../m/market.md).

## Potential Drawbacks

### Lack of Flexibility

Since tracker funds are designed to follow an [index](../i/index_instrument.md), there is no flexibility for the [fund manager](../f/fund_manager.md) to make adjustments based on [market](../m/market.md) conditions or insights, which might be seen as a limitation for some investors.

### Exposure to Market Downturns

While [diversification](../d/diversification.md) helps mitigate [risk](../r/risk.md), tracker funds are still exposed to overall [market](../m/market.md) downturns. If the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) they follow declines, the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s [value](../v/value.md) [will](../w/will.md) also drop.

### Tracking Error

Although often minor, [tracking error](../t/tracking_error.md) can occur and may result in performance slightly different from the target [index](../i/index_instrument.md).

## Conclusion

Tracker funds are an attractive investment option for those looking to achieve [market](../m/market.md) returns with low costs and low effort. By providing broad [market exposure](../m/market_exposure.md), [diversification](../d/diversification.md), and cost-[efficiency](../e/efficiency.md), they serve as a fundamental tool for both novice and seasoned investors. Despite some limitations, the advantages often outweigh the drawbacks, making tracker funds a key component in many investment strategies. Exploring different tracker funds and understanding their respective indices and [expense](../e/expense.md) ratios can help investors make well-informed decisions that align with their financial goals.

# Trend Following Models

## Introduction

[Trend following](../t/trend_following.md) is a strategy that aims to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on the continuation of existing [market](../m/market.md) trends. Whether the [market](../m/market.md) is bullish or bearish, [trend](../t/trend.md)-following models seek to enter trades at opportune times to follow the direction of the [market](../m/market.md). This method has stood the test of time, consistently producing substantial returns for those who have mastered its application.

## Core Concept

At its heart, [trend following](../t/trend_following.md) relies on the belief that prices [will](../w/will.md) continue to move in the same direction they have been moving rather than reversing course. This approach contrasts with [mean reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md) strategies, which bet that prices [will](../w/will.md) [return](../r/return.md) to a long-term average.

## Key Components

### Market Data

To effectively build and execute a [trend](../t/trend.md)-following strategy, accurate and timely [market](../m/market.md) data is crucial. Traders need access to:

- Price data
- [Volume](../v/volume.md) data
- Historical data

### Indicators

Indicators are essential tools in identifying trends. Some popular indicators include:

- Moving Averages (MA): Averages of price over a specified number of periods.
- [Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (RSI): Measures the speed and change of price movements.
- Moving Average Convergence [Divergence](../d/divergence.md) (MACD): Shows the relationship between two moving averages.

### Algorithms

Algorithms are at the core of [trend following](../t/trend_following.md) in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). These are rule-based systems designed to automatically implement the [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md).

## Trend Following Models

### Moving Average Crossover

**Description**: 
This model uses two moving averages of different time periods. A buy signal is generated when the shorter-term moving average crosses above the longer-term moving average. Conversely, a sell signal is generated when the shorter-term moving average crosses below the longer-term moving average.

**Code Example**:
```python
def moving_average_crossover(prices, short_window, long_window):
    short_ma = prices.rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1).mean()
    long_ma = prices.rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1).mean()

    signals = pd.DataFrame([index](../i/index_instrument.md)=prices.[index](../i/index_instrument.md))
    signals['signal'] = 0.0
    signals['short_ma'] = short_ma
    signals['long_ma'] = long_ma
    signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(signals['short_ma'][short_window:] > signals['long_ma'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)
    signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()

    [return](../r/return.md) signals
```

### Bollinger Bands

**Description**:
[Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md) consist of a middle band (simple moving average) and two outer bands that are calculated using standard deviations. When the price hits the lower band, a buy signal is generated. When the price hits the upper band, a sell signal is generated.

**Code Example**:
```python
def bollinger_bands(prices, window, num_std_dev):
    rolling_mean = prices.rolling(window=window).mean()
    rolling_std = prices.rolling(window=window).std()
    
    upper_band = rolling_mean + (rolling_std * num_std_dev)
    lower_band = rolling_mean - (rolling_std * num_std_dev)
    
    signals = pd.DataFrame([index](../i/index_instrument.md)=prices.[index](../i/index_instrument.md))
    signals['price'] = prices
    signals['upper_band'] = upper_band
    signals['lower_band'] = lower_band
    signals['rolling_mean'] = rolling_mean
    
    signals['buy_signal'] = np.where(prices < lower_band, 1.0, 0.0)
    signals['sell_signal'] = np.where(prices > upper_band, -1.0, 0.0)
    
    [return](../r/return.md) signals
```

### Relative Strength Index (RSI)

**Description**:
The RSI is a [momentum](../m/momentum.md) [oscillator](../o/oscillator.md) that measures the speed and change of price movements. It ranges from 0 to 100 and is typically used to identify [overbought](../o/overbought.md) or [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions. An RSI above 70 indicates [overbought](../o/overbought.md), while an RSI below 30 indicates [oversold](../o/oversold.md).

**Code Example**:
```python
def relative_strength_index(prices, window):
    [delta](../d/delta.md) = prices.diff()
    [gain](../g/gain.md) = ([delta](../d/delta.md).where([delta](../d/delta.md) > 0, 0)).fillna(0)
    loss = (-[delta](../d/delta.md).where([delta](../d/delta.md) < 0, 0)).fillna(0)

    avg_gain = [gain](../g/gain.md).rolling(window=window, min_periods=1).mean()
    avg_loss = loss.rolling(window=window, min_periods=1).mean()

    rs = avg_gain / avg_loss
    rsi = 100 - (100 / (1 + rs))
    
    signals = pd.DataFrame([index](../i/index_instrument.md)=prices.[index](../i/index_instrument.md))
    signals['price'] = prices
    signals['rsi'] = rsi

    signals['buy_signal'] = np.where(rsi < 30, 1.0, 0.0)
    signals['sell_signal'] = np.where(rsi > 70, -1.0, 0.0)

    [return](../r/return.md) signals
```

## Risk Management

Effective [trend](../t/trend.md)-following involves [robust](../r/robust.md) [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) techniques, including:

- **Stop Losses**: Setting predetermined levels to close out losing trades to prevent excessive losses.
- **[Position Sizing](../p/position_sizing.md)**: Determining the size of each [trade](../t/trade.md) based [on account](../o/on_account.md) size and [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md).

## Conclusion

[Trend](../t/trend.md)-following models are foundational strategies in the world of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). By understanding and implementing different types of [trend](../t/trend.md)-following models, such as Moving Average Crossover, [Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md), and RSI, traders can make informed decisions and potentially [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on existing [market](../m/market.md) trends.

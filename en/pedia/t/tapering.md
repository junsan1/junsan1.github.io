# Tapering

Tapering is a term used in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) to refer to the gradual winding down of central [bank](../b/bank.md) activities that aim to stimulate the [economy](../e/economy.md). This is achieved primarily through the reduction of the pace at which a central [bank](../b/bank.md), such as the Federal Reserve in the United States, purchases government securities or other financial instruments. The overall purpose of tapering is to eventually halt these purchases, normalization of monetary conditions, and prevention of runaway [inflation](../i/inflation.md) among other factors.

## Background

### Quantitative Easing

To understand tapering, it's essential to have a grasp of [Quantitative Easing](../q/quantitative_easing.md) (QE). QE is a non-traditional [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) tool used by central banks to stimulate the [economy](../e/economy.md) when standard monetary policies (such as cutting [interest](../i/interest.md) rates) become ineffective. Central banks implement QE by buying large quantities of government bonds and other securities, thereby increasing the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) and lowering [interest](../i/interest.md) rates to encourage borrowing and investment.

### Origins of Tapering

The concept of tapering gained significant attention in 2013 when the Federal Reserve, under the [leadership](../l/leadership.md) of Chairman [Ben Bernanke](../b/ben_bernanke.md), announced plans to gradually reduce the rate of QE. This idea was initially communicated in May 2013 and reiterated in June of the same year, leading to widespread [market](../m/market.md) reactions. The announcement became popularly known as the "[Taper Tantrum](../t/taper_tantrum.md)."

## Objectives of Tapering

Tapering aims to achieve several key objectives:

1. **Normalization of [Monetary Policy](../m/monetary_policy.md)**: Central banks use tapering to gradually transition from an accommodative (easy-[money](../m/money.md)) policy stance to a more normalized policy environment.
   
2. **Controlling [Inflation](../i/inflation.md)**: Excessive [asset](../a/asset.md) purchases can lead to heightened [inflation](../i/inflation.md). Tapering helps to mitigate the [risk](../r/risk.md) by reducing [asset](../a/asset.md) purchases progressively.
   
3. **Ensuring Financial Stability**: Continued large-scale [asset](../a/asset.md) purchases can create [asset](../a/asset.md) [bubbles](../b/bubble.md) and financial imbalances. Gradual reduction helps to manage these risks.

4. **Guiding [Market](../m/market.md) Expectations**: Tapering provides a transparent and predictable roadmap for investors and businesses, aiding in better decision-making.

## Mechanisms of Tapering

### Communication and Forward Guidance

Central banks usually start with clear communication strategies to prepare the [market](../m/market.md) for tapering. Forward [guidance](../g/guidance.md) involves explaining the [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md) that [warrant](../w/warrant.md) policy changes and outlining the expected path for tapering. Clear communication is critical to avoid [market](../m/market.md) disruptions and to manage [investor](../i/investor.md) expectations.

### Gradual Reduction

Once the forward [guidance](../g/guidance.md) is established, central banks typically reduce [asset](../a/asset.md) purchases in small, incremental steps. For example, the Federal Reserve might reduce its monthly [asset](../a/asset.md) purchases by $10 billion. This approach helps to minimize [market](../m/market.md) shocks and allows for the flexibility to pause or reverse tapering if [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md) change.

### Monitoring Economic Indicators

Throughout the tapering process, central banks closely monitor [key economic indicators](../k/key_economic_indicators.md) such as [inflation](../i/inflation.md), [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md), and GDP growth. Continuous evaluation ensures that tapering actions align with the evolving economic landscape. If indicators suggest a need for further stimulation, tapering can be adjusted accordingly.

## Case Studies

### The Federal Reserve (2013-2014)

The most well-known instance of tapering is the Federal Reserve's decision in 2013-2014. Reacting to an improving U.S. [economy](../e/economy.md) and [labor market](../l/labor_market.md), the Fed began to reduce its $85 billion monthly [bond](../b/bond.md)-buying program. By December 2013, the Fed announced a reduction of $10 billion per month. The gradual process continued until the [bond](../b/bond.md)-buying program was completely halted in October 2014.

### European Central Bank (ECB)

The European Central [Bank](../b/bank.md) (ECB) also utilized tapering to wind down its [Asset](../a/asset.md) Purchase Programme (APP). In October 2017, the ECB announced plans to reduce its purchases from €60 billion to €30 billion per month, starting in January 2018. By December 2018, the net purchases were ended, although the ECB continued to reinvest [principal](../p/principal.md) payments from maturing securities.

## Tapering Challenges

### Market Reactions

One of the biggest challenges during tapering is managing [market](../m/market.md) reactions. Abrupt or poorly communicated tapering plans can lead to significant [volatility](../v/volatility.md) in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). The "[Taper Tantrum](../t/taper_tantrum.md)" is a prime example, where unexpected announcements led to sharp increases in [bond](../b/bond.md) yields and declines in [equity](../e/equity.md) markets.

### Economic Data Dependencies 

Tapering plans are highly dependent on economic data. A sudden downturn in [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md) could necessitate a pause or [reversal](../r/reversal.md) of tapering, complicating the normalization process.

### Political and Public Pressure

Central banks often face political and public pressure regarding tapering decisions. Politicians and the public may have conflicting views on the timing and pace of tapering, which can add another layer of complexity.

## Conclusion

Tapering is a critical tool used by central banks to manage the transition from accommodative monetary policies to more normalized conditions. While it involves significant challenges, including [market](../m/market.md) reactions and economic dependencies, careful planning and transparent communication can help to mitigate these risks. The ultimate goal of tapering is to ensure financial stability, control [inflation](../i/inflation.md), and provide a predictable path for future [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) actions.

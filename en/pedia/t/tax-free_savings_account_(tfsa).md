# Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA)

## Introduction
A [Tax-Free](../t/tax_free.md) [Savings Account](../s/savings_account.md) (TFSA) is a type of registered [savings account](../s/savings_account.md) available to Canadian residents aged 18 or older with a valid social [insurance](../i/insurance.md) number (SIN). Introduced by the Canadian government in 2009, the TFSA allows individuals to earn [investment income](../i/investment_income.md)—including [interest](../i/interest.md), dividends, and [capital](../c/capital.md) gains—[tax-free](../t/tax_free.md) in a wide [range](../r/range.md) of financial instruments. The primary advantage of a TFSA is that contributions to the account are not tax-deductible, but all withdrawals, including the investment growth, are [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md).

## Key Features

### Contribution Limits
The Canadian government sets a contribution limit for TFSAs each year. For instance:
- 2009 to 2012: $5,000 annually
- 2013 to 2014: $5,500 annually
- 2015: $10,000
- 2016 to 2018: $5,500 annually
- 2019 to present: $6,000 annually

These amounts accumulate over time, meaning if you haven't contributed in previous years, you can catch up by depositing up to your total accumulated limit.

### Types of Investments Allowed
A TFSA can [hold](../h/hold.md) various types of investments, including:
- Savings accounts
- Guaranteed Investment Certificates (GICs)
- Mutual funds
- Bonds
- [Stocks](../s/stock.md)
- [Exchange](../e/exchange.md)-Traded Funds (ETFs)

### Withdrawals
One of the compelling benefits of a TFSA is the flexibility of withdrawals. Any amount withdrawn from a TFSA can be re-contributed in a future year without impacting the contribution room of the year the [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) was made. This feature provides substantial flexibility for managing irregular [income](../i/income.md) flows or financial emergencies.

### Tax Treatment
Contributions made to a TFSA are not tax-deductible, but all [investment income](../i/investment_income.md) earned in the account is [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md). This includes:
- [Interest](../i/interest.md)
- Dividends
- [Capital](../c/capital.md) gains

Withdrawals are also [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md), which can be particularly advantageous for individuals in higher [tax brackets](../t/tax_brackets.md).

### Over-contribution Penalties
If you exceed your TFSA contribution limit, the Canada [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Agency (CRA) imposes a penalty tax of 1% per month on the excess amount until it is withdrawn or the new contribution room becomes available on January 1 of the following year.

## Benefits

### Tax Efficiency
As the [investment income](../i/investment_income.md) earned in a TFSA is not subject to tax, it is an excellent vehicle for [compounding](../c/compounding.md) growth. This characteristic is particularly beneficial for [long-term investments](../l/long-term_investments.md) where [compounding](../c/compounding.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) can significantly magnify the investment's [value](../v/value.md).

### Flexibility
The ability to withdraw [money](../m/money.md) at any time without incurring [taxes](../t/taxes.md) makes the TFSA a versatile financial tool for short-term goals and emergency funds. Moreover, the room freed up by withdrawals can be re-contributed in subsequent years.

### Supplemental Retirement Income
A TFSA can serve as a supplementary source of retirement [income](../i/income.md). Unlike Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs), withdrawals from a TFSA do not affect eligibility for benefits programs such as Old Age [Security](../s/security.md) (OAS) or the Guaranteed [Income](../i/income.md) Supplement (GIS).

### Estate Planning
Upon the account holder's death, a TFSA can be transferred to a [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md) or a spouse without tax consequences, making it a valuable tool for [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md).

## Common Strategies

### Maximizing Contribution Room
One of the most effective strategies is to maximize annual contributions. By doing so, one can fully exploit the benefits of [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md) growth.

### Asset Allocation
A TFSA can be an ideal location for high-growth assets that could [yield](../y/yield.md) substantial [capital](../c/capital.md) gains since all [earnings](../e/earnings.md) are [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md). Many investors prefer allocating more aggressive investment vehicles, such as [stocks](../s/stock.md) or ETFs, within their TFSA.

### Income Splitting
Couples often use TFSAs for [income](../i/income.md) splitting. One partner can contribute to the other's TFSA irrespective of their [income](../i/income.md), effectively sharing the tax advantages.

## Drawbacks

### Contribution Limits
The primary limitation of TFSAs is the contribution room, which might not be sufficient for high-net-worth individuals looking to shelter a substantial part of their investments from [taxes](../t/taxes.md).

### Record Keeping
TFSAs require meticulous record-keeping to ensure contributions do not exceed limits, especially when using [multiple](../m/multiple.md) TFSAs with different financial institutions.

### Penalties
Over-contributions attract punitive [taxes](../t/taxes.md), so it's crucial to be aware of your contribution limits and manage the account accordingly.

## Conclusion

Through [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md) investment growth, flexible [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) [options](../o/options.md), and various eligible investment types, the TFSA is well-suited for both short-term financial goals and long-term [retirement planning](../r/retirement_planning.md).

# Too Big to Fail

The term "Too Big to [Fail](../f/fail.md)" (TBTF) refers to financial institutions that are so large and interconnected that their failure would be disastrous to the overall [economy](../e/economy.md). This concept suggests that certain institutions are so critical to the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md) that they must receive government support during times of financial stress to prevent widespread economic fallout.

## Origins and History

### The 1980s and Early Usages

The phrase "Too Big to [Fail](../f/fail.md)" originated in the 1980s. It came into widespread usage after a Congressional hearing in 1984, which dealt with the rescue of Continental Illinois [National Bank](../n/national_bank.md) and [Trust Company](../t/trust_company.md), one of the largest commercial banks in the United States at that time. This event marked a significant moment in financial history when the government stepped in to prevent the collapse of a major institution, setting a precedent for future interventions.

### The Financial Crisis of 2007-2008

The concept of TBTF gained even more prominence during the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) of 2007-2008. The crisis saw the failure and subsequent [bailout](../b/bailout.md) of several major financial institutions, including [Lehman Brothers](../l/lehman_brothers.md), [Bear Stearns](../b/bear_stearns.md), American International Group (AIG), and others. These events highlighted the systemic risks posed by large, interconnected banks and increased public awareness and controversy over the TBTF doctrine.

## Core Principles of Too Big to Fail

### Systemic Risk

[Systemic risk](../s/systemic_risk.md) refers to the potential for the failure of one financial institution to trigger a chain reaction of negative consequences throughout the entire [financial system](../f/financial_system.md). TBTF institutions are seen as major sources of [systemic risk](../s/systemic_risk.md) due to their size, complexity, and interconnectedness with other financial entities and markets.

### Government Interventions

Government interventions, such as bailouts and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) injections, are often justified under the TBTF doctrine to prevent potential domino effects in the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md). These interventions can take various forms, including direct [capital](../c/capital.md) infusions, guarantees on deposits, and emergency loans from central banks.

### Moral Hazard

One of the significant criticisms of the TBTF doctrine is the [issue](../i/issue.md) of [moral hazard](../m/moral_hazard.md). When large institutions are bailed out, it creates an expectation of future rescues, encouraging risky behavior, and leading to financial irresponsibility. This phenomenon occurs because banks believe that they [will](../w/will.md) be saved in times of trouble, reducing their incentives to manage risks prudently.

## Prominent Too Big to Fail Cases

### Lehman Brothers

[Lehman Brothers](../l/lehman_brothers.md)' [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) in September 2008 is one of the most notable examples of a TBTF institution. The investment [bank](../b/bank.md)'s failure is often cited as a key moment in the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md), causing panic in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and leading to a cascade of failures and bailouts.

### American International Group (AIG)

AIG, a global [insurance](../i/insurance.md) giant, received a massive [bailout](../b/bailout.md) from the U.S. government in 2008. The company's collapse would have had severe repercussions for countless other financial entities due to its extensive involvement in [credit default swaps](../c/credit_default_swaps.md) and other complex financial products.

### Bear Stearns

In March 2008, investment [bank](../b/bank.md) [Bear Stearns](../b/bear_stearns.md) faced a [liquidity crisis](../l/liquidity_crisis.md) and was acquired by JPMorgan Chase with federal assistance to prevent its collapse. This event is considered one of the precursors to the larger crisis later that year.

## Regulatory Responses and Reforms

### Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act

In response to the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) and the issues posed by TBTF institutions, the U.S. Congress passed the [Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act](../d/dodd-frank_wall_street_reform_and_consumer_protection_act.md) in 2010. This legislation introduced numerous regulatory reforms aimed at reducing [systemic risk](../s/systemic_risk.md) and improving the oversight of large financial institutions.

Key provisions related to TBTF include:

- **Title I**: Establishes the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) to monitor [systemic risk](../s/systemic_risk.md) and identify TBTF institutions.
- **Title II**: Creates the Orderly [Liquidation](../l/liquidation.md) Authority (OLA) to facilitate the resolution of failing financial firms in a controlled manner.
- **[Volcker Rule](../v/volcker_rule.md)**: Restricts banks from engaging in certain types of speculative trading and limits their ownership of [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds and [private equity](../p/private_equity.md) funds.

### Basel III

[Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md) is an international regulatory framework developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. It aims to strengthen the regulation, supervision, and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) of banks globally. Key components relevant to TBTF include higher [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements, [leverage ratios](../l/leverage_ratios.md), and the introduction of [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) standards to enhance the resilience of large financial institutions.

## Critiques and Ongoing Challenges

### Effectiveness of Reforms

Despite the introduction of regulatory reforms, some critics argue that TBTF institutions remain a significant [risk](../r/risk.md) to the global [financial system](../f/financial_system.md). They contend that the measures taken have not sufficiently reduced the size and interconnectedness of these institutions or addressed the [moral hazard](../m/moral_hazard.md) [issue](../i/issue.md) adequately.

### Financial Innovation and Complexity

Financial innovation and the increasing complexity of financial products and markets pose ongoing challenges in managing TBTF risks. Innovations such as shadow banking, cryptocurrencies, and complex [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) can contribute to [systemic risk](../s/systemic_risk.md) and complicate regulatory oversight.

### Global Coordination

Given the interconnectedness of the global [financial system](../f/financial_system.md), coordinating regulatory responses across different jurisdictions remains a challenge. Differences in regulatory frameworks and enforcement can create inconsistencies that TBTF institutions may exploit.

## Notable Figures and Institutions

### Paul Volcker

Paul Volcker, former Chairman of the Federal Reserve, played a significant role in shaping the regulatory landscape post-crisis. The [Volcker Rule](../v/volcker_rule.md), part of the Dodd-Frank Act, is named after him and aims to limit speculative trading activities by banks.

### Ben Bernanke

[Ben Bernanke](../b/ben_bernanke.md), who served as Chairman of the Federal Reserve during the 2007-2008 crisis, was a central figure in navigating the TBTF challenges. His policies and decisions, including the [bailout](../b/bailout.md) of AIG and other institutions, were crucial in stabilizing the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md).

### Financial Stability Board (FSB)

The Financial Stability Board is an international body that monitors and makes recommendations about the global [financial system](../f/financial_system.md). Established in 2009, the FSB plays a key role in addressing the TBTF problem by developing standards and coordinating regulatory efforts among G20 countries.

## Contemporary Examples and Implications

### Latest Developments

As [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and institutions continue to evolve, the TBTF concept remains highly relevant. Recent events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have underscored the importance of closely monitoring and managing systemic risks associated with large financial institutions. Central banks and governments worldwide have had to implement unprecedented financial support measures to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic, reinforcing the TBTF [issue](../i/issue.md).

### Future Directions

Going forward, addressing the challenges posed by TBTF institutions [will](../w/will.md) require a multi-faceted approach, including:

- Continued enhancement of regulatory frameworks to keep pace with financial innovations.
- Increased international collaboration to ensure a cohesive and effective regulatory environment.
- Ongoing efforts to mitigate [moral hazard](../m/moral_hazard.md) by holding TBTF institutions accountable and promoting responsible [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices.

## Conclusion

The "Too Big to [Fail](../f/fail.md)" concept remains a central and controversial [issue](../i/issue.md) in the world of [finance](../f/finance.md). While significant progress has been made in addressing the systemic risks posed by large, interconnected institutions, challenges persist. Ensuring the stability of the global [financial system](../f/financial_system.md) requires continuous vigilance, effective regulation, and a commitment to preventing and managing the risks associated with TBTF entities.

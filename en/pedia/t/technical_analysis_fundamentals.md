# Technical Analysis Fundamentals

[Technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) is a method used to evaluate and forecast the future price movements of securities by analyzing past trading activity and price fluctuations. Unlike [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md), which focuses on evaluating a company’s [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) based on [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md), [earnings](../e/earnings.md), and [market](../m/market.md) position, [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) is solely concerned with the price movements and [volume](../v/volume.md) data of the [security](../s/security.md) being traded. Traders and investors use [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) to identify patterns and trends that can inform their trading decisions. Below are detailed explanations of key aspects of [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) fundamentals:

## Price Chart Basics

### Line Charts
A [line chart](../l/line_chart.md) is the simplest form of chart used in [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md). It connects closing prices of the [asset](../a/asset.md) over a specified period with a continuous line. The simplicity of the [line chart](../l/line_chart.md) makes it easy to visualize overall trends over time. 

### Bar Charts
Bar charts provide more information than line charts. Each bar represents the [open](../o/open.md), high, low, and close prices (OHLC) for a given time period. The top of the bar marks the highest price, the bottom marks the lowest price, and horizontal lines to the left and right indicate the [open](../o/open.md) and close prices, respectively.

### Candlestick Charts
[Candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) charts [offer](../o/offer.md) a visually intuitive presentation of price data. Each '[candlestick](../c/candlestick.md)' shows the [open](../o/open.md), high, low, and close for a specified period. The 'body' of the [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) shows the [open](../o/open.md) and close prices, while the 'wicks' or 'shadows' indicate the highs and lows. If the close price is higher than the [open](../o/open.md) price, the body is typically colored green or white; if the close price is lower, it is colored red or black.

## Trend Analysis

### Uptrends and Downtrends
An [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md) is characterized by prices moving in a generally upward direction, indicating more buyers than sellers. Conversely, a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md) involves prices moving downward, suggesting more sellers than buyers. These trends can be identified by drawing trendlines that connect the higher lows in an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md) or the lower highs in a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md).

### Sideways Trends
Sideways trends, also known as [consolidation](../c/consolidation.md) phases, occur when prices move horizontally within a narrow [range](../r/range.md). During these periods, neither buyers nor sellers have the upper hand, and the [security](../s/security.md) may be building [momentum](../m/momentum.md) for a future move.

## Support and Resistance Levels

### Support
[Support levels](../s/support_levels.md) are price points where a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md) can be expected to pause due to a concentration of buying [interest](../i/interest.md). A support level can be thought of as a 'floor' that the price typically does not fall below.

### Resistance
Resistance levels are price points where an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md) can be expected to pause due to a concentration of selling [interest](../i/interest.md). Like a ceiling, the price has difficulty moving above this level.

## Indicators and Oscillators

### Moving Averages
Moving averages smooth out price data to identify the direction of a [trend](../t/trend.md). The simple moving average (SMA) calculates the average price over a specific number of periods, while the exponential moving average (EMA) gives more weight to recent prices, making it more responsive to new information.

### Relative Strength Index (RSI)
The RSI measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate [overbought](../o/overbought.md) or [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions in the price of a [security](../s/security.md). The RSI ranges from 0 to 100, with readings above 70 indicating [overbought](../o/overbought.md) conditions and readings below 30 indicating [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions.

### Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
MACD is a [trend](../t/trend.md)-following [indicator](../i/indicator.md) that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a [security](../s/security.md)’s price. It consists of the MACD line (the difference between two EMAs), the signal line (an EMA of the MACD line), and a [histogram](../h/histogram.md) that shows the difference between MACD line and signal line.

## Chart Patterns

### Head and Shoulders
The [head and shoulders pattern](../h/head_and_shoulders_pattern.md) is a [reversal](../r/reversal.md) pattern that indicates a high probability of a price [trend reversal](../t/trend_reversal.md). It consists of three peaks: a higher peak (head) between two lower peaks (shoulders).

### Double Bottoms and Tops
A [double bottom](../d/double_bottom.md) is a bullish [reversal](../r/reversal.md) pattern that forms after a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md) and indicates the price is likely to start rising. Conversely, a [double top](../d/double_top.md) is a bearish [reversal](../r/reversal.md) pattern that forms after an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md), suggesting the price [will](../w/will.md) likely fall.

### Flags and Pennants
These short-term [continuation patterns](../c/continuation_patterns.md) indicate a brief [consolidation](../c/consolidation.md) before the previous [trend](../t/trend.md) resumes. Flags are shaped like parallelograms, while pennants have converging [trend](../t/trend.md) lines that resemble a small symmetrical [triangle](../t/triangle.md).

## Volume Analysis

### Volume Indicators
[Volume indicators](../v/volume_indicators.md) show the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) or contracts traded in a [security](../s/security.md) over a specific period. High trading [volume](../v/volume.md) often indicates strong [interest](../i/interest.md) in the [security](../s/security.md), either from buyers or sellers, while low [volume](../v/volume.md) suggests a lack of [interest](../i/interest.md).

### On-Balance Volume (OBV)
OBV is a cumulative [indicator](../i/indicator.md) that adds [volume](../v/volume.md) on up days and subtracts [volume](../v/volume.md) on down days. The theory is that OBV changes indicate institutional trading activity that can precede price changes.

### Accumulation/Distribution Line (A/D Line)
The A/D line uses [volume](../v/volume.md) to assess the strength of a price [trend](../t/trend.md). It is calculated by adding a portion of the period’s [volume](../v/volume.md) to a cumulative total, depending on where the price closed in relation to the [range](../r/range.md).

## Technical Analysis in Practice

### Combining Indicators
Many traders use a combination of different indicators and tools to make informed decisions. For instance, moving averages can be combined with the RSI or MACD to confirm trends and signal entry or exit points.

### Trading Strategies
[Technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) informs various [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), including [day trading](../d/day_trading.md), [swing trading](../s/swing_trading.md), and position trading. Each strategy has its own time frame and uses different tools to achieve its objectives.

### Software and Platforms
Utilizing software and trading platforms is essential for effective [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md). These tools [offer](../o/offer.md) advanced charting capabilities, a wide [range](../r/range.md) of indicators, and the ability to automate [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). Some popular platforms include MetaTrader, [TradeStation](../t/tradestation.md), and [Thinkorswim](../t/thinkorswim.md).

By understanding and applying the fundamentals of [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md), traders can make more informed decisions and improve their [trading performance](../t/trading_performance.md). Here are some companies that provide [advanced technical analysis](../a/advanced_technical_analysis.md) tools and platforms:

- [MetaTrader](https://www.metatrader4.com/)
- [TradeStation](https://www.tradestation.com/)
- [Thinkorswim](https://www.tdameritrade.com/tools-and-platforms/thinkorswim.page)

Understanding these principles sets the foundation for more advanced analysis techniques and strategy development in trading.

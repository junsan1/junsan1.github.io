# Technical Analysis Fundamentals

[Technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) is a method used to evaluate and forecast the future price movements of securities by analyzing past trading activity and price fluctuations. Unlike [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md), which focuses on evaluating a company’s intrinsic value based on financial statements, earnings, and market position, [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) is solely concerned with the price movements and volume data of the security being traded. Traders and investors use [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) to identify patterns and trends that can inform their trading decisions. Below are detailed explanations of key aspects of [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) fundamentals:

## Price Chart Basics

### Line Charts
A line chart is the simplest form of chart used in [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md). It connects closing prices of the asset over a specified period with a continuous line. The simplicity of the line chart makes it easy to visualize overall trends over time. 

### Bar Charts
Bar charts provide more information than line charts. Each bar represents the open, high, low, and close prices (OHLC) for a given time period. The top of the bar marks the highest price, the bottom marks the lowest price, and horizontal lines to the left and right indicate the open and close prices, respectively.

### Candlestick Charts
Candlestick charts offer a visually intuitive presentation of price data. Each 'candlestick' shows the open, high, low, and close for a specified period. The 'body' of the candlestick shows the open and close prices, while the 'wicks' or 'shadows' indicate the highs and lows. If the close price is higher than the open price, the body is typically colored green or white; if the close price is lower, it is colored red or black.

## Trend Analysis

### Uptrends and Downtrends
An uptrend is characterized by prices moving in a generally upward direction, indicating more buyers than sellers. Conversely, a downtrend involves prices moving downward, suggesting more sellers than buyers. These trends can be identified by drawing trendlines that connect the higher lows in an uptrend or the lower highs in a downtrend.

### Sideways Trends
Sideways trends, also known as consolidation phases, occur when prices move horizontally within a narrow range. During these periods, neither buyers nor sellers have the upper hand, and the security may be building momentum for a future move.

## Support and Resistance Levels

### Support
[Support levels](../s/support_levels.md) are price points where a downtrend can be expected to pause due to a concentration of buying interest. A support level can be thought of as a 'floor' that the price typically does not fall below.

### Resistance
Resistance levels are price points where an uptrend can be expected to pause due to a concentration of selling interest. Like a ceiling, the price has difficulty moving above this level.

## Indicators and Oscillators

### Moving Averages
Moving averages smooth out price data to identify the direction of a trend. The simple moving average (SMA) calculates the average price over a specific number of periods, while the exponential moving average (EMA) gives more weight to recent prices, making it more responsive to new information.

### Relative Strength Index (RSI)
The RSI measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a security. The RSI ranges from 0 to 100, with readings above 70 indicating overbought conditions and readings below 30 indicating oversold conditions.

### Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
MACD is a trend-following indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security’s price. It consists of the MACD line (the difference between two EMAs), the signal line (an EMA of the MACD line), and a histogram that shows the difference between MACD line and signal line.

## Chart Patterns

### Head and Shoulders
The [head and shoulders pattern](../h/head_and_shoulders_pattern.md) is a reversal pattern that indicates a high probability of a price [trend reversal](../t/trend_reversal.md). It consists of three peaks: a higher peak (head) between two lower peaks (shoulders).

### Double Bottoms and Tops
A double bottom is a bullish reversal pattern that forms after a downtrend and indicates the price is likely to start rising. Conversely, a double top is a bearish reversal pattern that forms after an uptrend, suggesting the price will likely fall.

### Flags and Pennants
These short-term [continuation patterns](../c/continuation_patterns.md) indicate a brief consolidation before the previous trend resumes. Flags are shaped like parallelograms, while pennants have converging trend lines that resemble a small symmetrical triangle.

## Volume Analysis

### Volume Indicators
[Volume indicators](../v/volume_indicators.md) show the number of shares or contracts traded in a security over a specific period. High trading volume often indicates strong interest in the security, either from buyers or sellers, while low volume suggests a lack of interest.

### On-Balance Volume (OBV)
OBV is a cumulative indicator that adds volume on up days and subtracts volume on down days. The theory is that OBV changes indicate institutional trading activity that can precede price changes.

### Accumulation/Distribution Line (A/D Line)
The A/D line uses volume to assess the strength of a price trend. It is calculated by adding a portion of the period’s volume to a cumulative total, depending on where the price closed in relation to the range.

## Technical Analysis in Practice

### Combining Indicators
Many traders use a combination of different indicators and tools to make informed decisions. For instance, moving averages can be combined with the RSI or MACD to confirm trends and signal entry or exit points.

### Trading Strategies
[Technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) informs various [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), including [day trading](../d/day_trading.md), [swing trading](../s/swing_trading.md), and position trading. Each strategy has its own time frame and uses different tools to achieve its objectives.

### Software and Platforms
Utilizing software and trading platforms is essential for effective [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md). These tools offer advanced charting capabilities, a wide range of indicators, and the ability to automate [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). Some popular platforms include MetaTrader, TradeStation, and Thinkorswim.

By understanding and applying the fundamentals of [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md), traders can make more informed decisions and improve their [trading performance](../t/trading_performance.md). Here are some companies that provide [advanced technical analysis](../a/advanced_technical_analysis.md) tools and platforms:

- [MetaTrader](https://www.metatrader4.com/)
- [TradeStation](https://www.tradestation.com/)
- [Thinkorswim](https://www.tdameritrade.com/tools-and-platforms/thinkorswim.page)

Understanding these principles sets the foundation for more advanced analysis techniques and strategy development in trading.

# Tomorrow Next (Tom Next)

The term "Tomorrow Next" (often abbreviated as "Tom Next") refers to a specific type of [foreign exchange](../f/foreign_exchange.md) (Forex) [swap](../s/swap.md) [transaction](../t/transaction.md). It is an essential concept in Forex trading, primarily used by financial institutions, traders, and investors to manage [currency](../c/currency.md) positions and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) efficiently.

## Definition

Tom Next [swap](../s/swap.md) transactions involve buying or selling a [currency](../c/currency.md) for delivery on the next [business](../b/business.md) day (i.e., tomorrow) and simultaneously selling or buying it back for delivery on the [business](../b/business.md) day after that (i.e., the day after tomorrow). This [swap](../s/swap.md) allows traders to extend their positions without taking [physical delivery](../p/physical_delivery_in_trading.md) of the [currency](../c/currency.md), thus managing their short-term [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) needs more effectively.

## Mechanics of Tom Next

### Steps Involved

1. **Initial [Transaction](../t/transaction.md)**: On the first day, the [trader](../t/trader.md) enters into an agreement to buy or sell a specific [currency](../c/currency.md) pair for delivery on the next [business](../b/business.md) day.
2. **Simultaneous Reverse [Transaction](../t/transaction.md)**: At the same time, the [trader](../t/trader.md) agrees to reverse the initial [transaction](../t/transaction.md) by selling or buying back the same [currency](../c/currency.md) pair for delivery on the subsequent [business](../b/business.md) day.

This effectively creates a net-zero position in terms of [currency](../c/currency.md) [holdings](../h/holdings.md) but allows the [trader](../t/trader.md) to maintain other [open](../o/open.md) positions or speculative bets.

### Example

Suppose a [trader](../t/trader.md) wants to [hold](../h/hold.md) a long position in EUR/USD overnight but doesn't want the [physical delivery](../p/physical_delivery_in_trading.md) of the [currency](../c/currency.md). They could:

- **Day 1 (Today)**: Enter into a contract to buy EUR/USD for settlement tomorrow.
- **Day 2 (Tomorrow)**: Simultaneously enter into a contract to sell the same amount of EUR/USD for settlement the day after tomorrow.

This sequence allows the [trader](../t/trader.md) to avoid [physical delivery](../p/physical_delivery_in_trading.md) while maintaining their exposure to the [currency](../c/currency.md) pair.

## Importance in Forex Trading

### Liquidity Management

Tom Next swaps are a critical tool for [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) management within the Forex [market](../m/market.md). They permit traders to roll over positions to the next trading day, thereby avoiding the complications of actual delivery.

### Arbitrage Opportunities

Tom Next swaps can also present [arbitrage opportunities](../a/arbitrage_opportunities.md), wherein traders can exploit differences in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates between currencies. This is particularly relevant in the context of the "[carry trade](../c/carry_trade.md)," a popular strategy whereby traders borrow in low-[interest](../i/interest.md)-rate currencies and invest in high-[interest](../i/interest.md)-rate currencies.

## Impact on Interest Rates and Forward Rates

### Interest Rate Differential

The [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) differential between two currencies in a [currency](../c/currency.md) pair plays a significant role in Tom Next transactions. The difference between the [interest](../i/interest.md) rates is reflected in the [swap](../s/swap.md) points, which indicate the cost or benefit of rolling over the position.

### Forward Rate Calculation

The [forward rate](../f/forward_rate.md) is adjusted based on the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) differential. This adjustment is crucial for Tom Next swaps, as it influences the pricing and profitability of these transactions.

## Key Players in Tom Next Market

### Financial Institutions

Banks and other financial institutions are the primary participants in the Tom Next [market](../m/market.md). They utilize these swaps to manage their own [currency](../c/currency.md) exposures and to provide [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) to their clients.

### Hedge Funds and Speculators

[Hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds and speculative traders also engage in Tom Next transactions to take advantage of short-term [market](../m/market.md) movements or to maintain their [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) without taking [physical delivery](../p/physical_delivery_in_trading.md) of currencies.

### Corporations

Corporations with international operations may use Tom Next swaps to manage their foreign [currency](../c/currency.md) [risk](../r/risk.md), ensuring they have the necessary [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) in the required currencies for their day-to-day operations.

### Risk Management

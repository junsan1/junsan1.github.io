# Tomorrow Next (Tom Next)

The term "Tomorrow Next" (often abbreviated as "Tom Next") refers to a specific type of foreign exchange (Forex) swap transaction. It is an essential concept in Forex trading, primarily used by financial institutions, traders, and investors to manage currency positions and liquidity efficiently.

## Definition

Tom Next swap transactions involve buying or selling a currency for delivery on the next business day (i.e., tomorrow) and simultaneously selling or buying it back for delivery on the business day after that (i.e., the day after tomorrow). This swap allows traders to extend their positions without taking physical delivery of the currency, thus managing their short-term liquidity needs more effectively.

## Mechanics of Tom Next

### Steps Involved

1. **Initial Transaction**: On the first day, the trader enters into an agreement to buy or sell a specific currency pair for delivery on the next business day.
2. **Simultaneous Reverse Transaction**: At the same time, the trader agrees to reverse the initial transaction by selling or buying back the same currency pair for delivery on the subsequent business day.

This effectively creates a net-zero position in terms of currency holdings but allows the trader to maintain other open positions or speculative bets.

### Example

Suppose a trader wants to hold a long position in EUR/USD overnight but doesn't want the physical delivery of the currency. They could:

- **Day 1 (Today)**: Enter into a contract to buy EUR/USD for settlement tomorrow.
- **Day 2 (Tomorrow)**: Simultaneously enter into a contract to sell the same amount of EUR/USD for settlement the day after tomorrow.

This sequence allows the trader to avoid physical delivery while maintaining their exposure to the currency pair.

## Importance in Forex Trading

### Liquidity Management

Tom Next swaps are a critical tool for liquidity management within the Forex market. They permit traders to roll over positions to the next trading day, thereby avoiding the complications of actual delivery.

### Arbitrage Opportunities

Tom Next swaps can also present arbitrage opportunities, wherein traders can exploit differences in interest rates between currencies. This is particularly relevant in the context of the "carry trade," a popular strategy whereby traders borrow in low-interest-rate currencies and invest in high-interest-rate currencies.

## Impact on Interest Rates and Forward Rates

### Interest Rate Differential

The interest rate differential between two currencies in a currency pair plays a significant role in Tom Next transactions. The difference between the interest rates is reflected in the swap points, which indicate the cost or benefit of rolling over the position.

### Forward Rate Calculation

The forward rate is adjusted based on the interest rate differential. This adjustment is crucial for Tom Next swaps, as it influences the pricing and profitability of these transactions.

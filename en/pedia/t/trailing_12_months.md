# Trailing 12 Months

Trailing 12 Months (TTM) is a financial metric used to evaluate a company's performance over the most recent 12-month period. This metric is particularly useful because it provides a more current view of a company's [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) than annual reports, which are often outdated by the time they are published. TTM is widely used in [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md) to gauge trends and compare performance over a rolling period.

## Understanding TTM

The TTM calculation sums up the financial data from the last four quarters, rather than relying on outdated annual reports. This rolling format helps investors, analysts, and stakeholders to make timely and more accurate assessments.

### Why TTM is Important

1. **Current Data:** It eliminates the time lag inherent in annual reporting. For instance, if today's date is September 15, 2023, the TTM would include financial data from September 2022 to August 2023.
   
2. **Seasonal Adjustment:** By including data from all four quarters, TTM helps adjust for seasonal variations and provides a normalized view of the company's operations.

3. **Benchmarking:** Investors often use TTM to compare different companies in the same [industry](../i/industry.md), align their performances, and identify trends.

4. **Smooths Out Anomalies:** It mitigates the impact of a single anomalous quarter, giving a more balanced view of the company’s performance.

## Calculation of TTM

To calculate TTM, one needs to sum up the values of relevant financial metrics over the last four quarters. The general formula is:

\[ \text{TTM} = Q_4 + Q_3 + Q_2 + Q_1 \]

Where \( Q_4 \) to \( Q_1 \) are the financial results from the most recent four quarters.

### Example Calculation

Consider a company with the following quarterly revenues:

- Q4: $10 million (most recent quarter)
- Q3: $8 million
- Q2: $9 million
- Q1: $7 million

TTM [Revenue](../r/revenue.md):

\[ \text{TTM} = 10 + 8 + 9 + 7 = 34 \text{ million dollars} \]

## Applications in Financial Metrics

TTM is not just restricted to [revenue](../r/revenue.md); it can be used with various financial metrics:

- **[Earnings](../e/earnings.md):** TTM [Earnings](../e/earnings.md) per Share (EPS), TTM [Earnings](../e/earnings.md) Before [Interest](../i/interest.md) and [Taxes](../t/taxes.md) (EBIT)
- **Cash Flows:** TTM operating [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md), free [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md)
- **Ratios:** Price to [Earnings](../e/earnings.md) (P/E) TTM, [Debt](../d/debt.md)-to-[Equity](../e/equity.md) (D/E) TTM

### TTM in Ratios

One of the most common uses of TTM is in calculating [financial ratios](../f/financial_ratios.md). 

1. **TTM PE Ratio:** This ratio is used to determine the [market value](../m/market_value.md) of a stock compared to the company's [earnings](../e/earnings.md) over the trailing 12 months.

\[ \text{TTM PE Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Share Price}}{\text{TTM [Earnings](../e/earnings.md) per Share (EPS)}} \]

2. **TTM [Dividend Yield](../d/dividend_yield.md):** This ratio indicates how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative to its stock price.

\[ \text{TTM [Dividend Yield](../d/dividend_yield.md)} = \frac{\text{TTM Dividends per Share}}{\text{Current Share Price}} \]

## TTM in Different Financial Statements

### Income Statement

The TTM figure can provide a comprehensive look at a company’s profitability over the last year, inclusive of any seasonal effects. 

- **TTM [Revenue](../r/revenue.md):** Summation of [revenue](../r/revenue.md) over the last four quarters.
- **TTM Net [Income](../i/income.md):** Summation of the net [income](../i/income.md) over the last four quarters.

### Balance Sheet

While balance sheets are mostly static and provide a snapshot at a specific point in time, combining [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) figures with TTM metrics from the [income statement](../i/income_statement.md) can [offer](../o/offer.md) valuable insights.

- **TTM ROE ([Return](../r/return.md) on [Equity](../e/equity.md)):**

\[ \text{TTM ROE} = \frac{\text{TTM Net Income}}{\text{Average [Shareholder](../s/shareholder.md)'s [Equity](../e/equity.md)}} \]

### Cash Flow Statement

TTM metrics derived from the [cash flow statement](../c/cash_flow_statement.md) give an idea of how much actual cash a company has generated over the last year.

- **TTM Operating [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md):** Summation of cash generated from operations over the last four quarters.
- **TTM Free [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md):** Summation of cash generated after [capital](../c/capital.md) expenditures over the last four quarters.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

1. **Recency:** TTM provides the latest available information for making well-informed decisions.
2. **[Trend Analysis](../t/trend_analysis.md):** Helps in identifying trends by [offering](../o/offering.md) a comprehensive look at financial data over a year-long period.
3. **Comparability:** Makes it easier to compare [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md) across companies on a more normalized [basis](../b/basis.md).

### Disadvantages

1. **Complexity:** Calculating TTM can be complex and time-consuming, especially when aggregating data for [multiple](../m/multiple.md) metrics.
2. **Data Availability:** Not all companies provide financials in a way that makes TTM calculations straightforward.
3. **Quarterly Inconsistencies:** Abrupt changes or significant events in a particular quarter may skew the TTM results.

## TTM and Financial Planning

### Forecasting

TTM metrics can be a vital tool for [financial forecasting](../f/financial_forecasting.md). By understanding recent performance trends, companies can better predict future performance.

### Budgeting

Using TTM in budgeting can help in setting more accurate and realistic financial goals. Organizations can adjust their budgets to reflect the latest operational realities.

### Valuation

Investment analysts frequently use TTM data for [business valuations](../b/business_valuations.md). Metrics like Price/[Earnings](../e/earnings.md) (P/E) ratio, when calculated with TTM [earnings](../e/earnings.md), [offer](../o/offer.md) a more up-to-date picture of a company’s [valuation](../v/valuation.md).

## Conclusion

Trailing 12 Months (TTM) is an invaluable metric in [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md), providing timely and accurate data that spans the most recent year. It addresses the shortcomings associated with static annual reporting, making it a preferred tool for investors, analysts, and financial planners. By using TTM, stakeholders can make more informed decisions, identify trends, and better understand a company's [financial health](../f/financial_health.md).

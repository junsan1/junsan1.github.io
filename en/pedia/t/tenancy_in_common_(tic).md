# Tenancy in Common (TIC)

### Introduction
Tenancy in Common (TIC) is a form of ownership in [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) wherein two or more individuals [hold](../h/hold.md) [shares](../s/shares.md) in a property. Each tenant possesses an undivided [interest](../i/interest.md) in the property, meaning that while they may [hold](../h/hold.md) different percentages of ownership, they all have equal access and rights to the entirety of the property. This type of co-ownership is fundamentally distinct from other arrangements such as [joint tenancy](../j/joint_tenancy.md) and [tenancy by the entirety](../t/tenancy_by_the_entirety.md).

### Distinguishing Features
1. **Ownership [Shares](../s/shares.md)**: Unlike [joint tenancy](../j/joint_tenancy.md), where ownership is typically divided evenly, TIC allows for unequal [shares](../s/shares.md). One tenant might own 50%, another 30%, and yet another 20%, based on their investment or agreement.

2. **No Right of Survivorship**: In TIC, there is no automatic right of survivorship. If one co-owner dies, their share passes to their heirs or as indicated in their [will](../w/will.md), rather than automatically transferring to the surviving co-owners.

3. **Transfer of [Interest](../i/interest.md)**: Each tenant has the right to sell, [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md), or otherwise transfer their share of the property. This can introduce new co-owners without the need for the consent of the other tenants.

4. **Independence of Tenants**: Tenants in common can independently manage their [shares](../s/shares.md) without affecting the rights of other co-tenants. For instance, one co-owner could lease out their share of the property.

### Real Estate Applications
TIC is a popular arrangement for various types of properties including residential homes, commercial buildings, and investment properties. The flexibility and relative simplicity of TIC make it especially appealing for investors and families.

### Advantages
1. **Flexibility**: TIC provides considerable flexibility in the [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of ownership [shares](../s/shares.md) based on investment, contribution, or agreement.
2. **[Estate Planning](../e/estate_planning.md)**: It allows for tailored [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md) as the co-owner's share can be bequeathed according to their wishes.
3. **Financial Accessibility**: [Multiple](../m/multiple.md) tenants can pool resources to purchase and maintain higher-valued properties that might be unattainable individually.

### Disadvantages
1. **Management Issues**: Without a clear agreement, managing a property with several co-owners can become complex and may lead to disputes.
2. **[Financial Risk](../f/financial_risk.md)**: Each tenant can encumber their share with a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) or [debt](../d/debt.md), which may put the entire property at [risk](../r/risk.md) if they [default](../d/default.md).
3. **[Sale](../s/sale.md) Complications**: Selling a share can be difficult without the agreement of all co-tenants, potentially diminishing [market value](../m/market_value.md).

### Legal Aspects
**Formation**: TIC agreements should ideally be established in writing, outlining the specifics of ownership percentages, responsibilities for expenses, and dispute resolution mechanisms.

**Disputes and Partition Actions**: Co-tenants might face disagreements regarding [property management](../p/property_management.md) or financial contributions. If mediation fails, any tenant can file a partition action, a legal process to divide the property, though often leading to its [sale](../s/sale.md).

### Comparative Analysis
**TIC vs. [Joint Tenancy](../j/joint_tenancy.md)**: The primary distinction is the right of survivorship in [joint tenancy](../j/joint_tenancy.md), which means the [interest](../i/interest.md) of a deceased tenant automatically passes to the remaining co-owners, contrary to TIC where it goes to the heirs.

**TIC vs. Tenancy by Entirety**: This is a special form of [joint tenancy](../j/joint_tenancy.md) available only to married couples. It provides protection against creditors and includes survivorship rights, unlike the flexible, individual-thought-oriented TIC.

### Case Studies
**Residential Example**: A group of siblings inherits a family [home](../h/home.md). Choosing TIC allows each to own a specified percentage, reflecting their individual contributions towards maintenance and property [taxes](../t/taxes.md).

**[Investment Property](../i/investment_property.md)**: A consortium of investors purchases a commercial building, each holding a percentage reflecting their investment. They establish a TIC agreement to manage leasing, expenses, and eventual [profit](../p/profit.md) sharing.

### Conclusion
Tenancy in Common (TIC) offers a flexible, accessible means of shared [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) ownership. It is particularly suited for those seeking tailored investment opportunities or personalized [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md). However, it requires careful legal arrangements and harmonious co-tenant relationships to manage effectively and avoid complications.

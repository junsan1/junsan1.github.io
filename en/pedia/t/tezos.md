# Tezos

## Introduction to Tezos

Tezos is an [open](../o/open.md)-source [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) protocol for assets and decentralized applications (dApps) that can evolve by upgrading itself. Stakeholders vote on amendments to the protocol, including upgrades to the governance mechanism itself. Developed by Arthur Breitman and Kathleen Breitman, the Tezos [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) was launched in 2018. It aims to [offer](../o/offer.md) a governance model that mitigates the often contentious and hard-fork-prone nature of [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) development.

## Key Features of Tezos

- **Self-Amending [Blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md):** Tezos is designed to evolve over time, integrating new innovations without disrupting its stability. By allowing protocol upgrades without requiring hard forks, it reduces the risks associated with radical changes to the network.
  
- **[On-Chain Governance](../o/on-chain_governance.md):** In Tezos, stakeholders can participate in the governance process by voting on proposals. This leads to more inclusive and decentralized decision-making.

- **Formal Verification:** Tezos supports the use of formal verification, a technique that mathematically proves the correctness of code. This is particularly beneficial for high-[value](../v/value.md) [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md) that require [robust](../r/robust.md) [security](../s/security.md).

- **Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS):** Unlike traditional Proof-of-Work (PoW) systems, Tezos uses a Delegated Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. This allows for higher [throughput](../t/throughput.md) and energy [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md), making it a more scalable solution.

## Understanding the Components

### XTZ Tokens

XTZ, often referred to as "tezzies," are the native tokens of the Tezos [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md). These tokens are used for staking, voting, and [transaction fees](../t/transaction_fees.md) within the network.

### Bakers

In the Tezos ecosystem, "bakers" are akin to validators in other [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) platforms. They are responsible for validating transactions and adding new blocks to the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md). To become a baker, one must [hold](../h/hold.md) a certain amount of XTZ and run a baking node.

### Smart Contracts

Tezos supports [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md) written in Michelson, a low-level stack-based language that was created explicitly for this [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md). Michelson allows for formal verification, making it suitable for developing secure and reliable [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md).

### Decentralized Applications (dApps)

The Tezos [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) serves as a platform for decentralized applications. Developers can create and deploy dApps that are trustless, secure, and [leverage](../l/leverage.md) the Tezos ecosystem advantages.

## Tezos Governance Model

One of the most standout features of Tezos is its [on-chain governance](../o/on-chain_governance.md) mechanism. This model allows the community to have a say in the protocol's changes, upgrades, and overall direction. Here's how it works:

- **Proposal Period:** Anyone can propose a protocol [upgrade](../u/upgrade.md). To do so, they must have held XTZ tokens and satisfy a minimum staking requirement.
  
- **Exploration Vote:** The community votes on the proposed [upgrade](../u/upgrade.md). A proposal must receive a certain percentage of support to proceed.

- **Testing Period:** If the proposal receives the necessary support, it enters a testing period where it is implemented on a testnet. This period allows the community to assess the proposal's practical impact.

- **Promotion Vote:** After the testing period, the community votes again to decide whether the [upgrade](../u/upgrade.md) should be implemented on the main network.

- **Adoption:** If the promotion vote succeeds, the [upgrade](../u/upgrade.md) is adopted, and the Tezos [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) evolves.

## Security in Tezos

### Formal Verification

Formal verification is one of the key [security](../s/security.md) features of Tezos. It involves using mathematical proofs to verify the correctness of [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md). This technique reduces the likelihood of bugs and vulnerabilities that could be exploited.

### Secure Proof-of-Stake

Tezos employs a secure implementation of Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS). Each validator is required to stake a substantial amount of XTZ, which aligns their incentives with network [security](../s/security.md). Slashing conditions are also in place. If a baker acts maliciously or negligently, their staked XTZ can be slashed, thereby discouraging harmful behavior.

## Tezos in the Ecosystem

### Partnerships and Collaborations

Tezos has formed numerous partnerships and collaborations to expand its use cases and ecosystem. Some notable partnerships include:

- **TQ Tezos:** Focuses on building tools and applications on Tezos.
- **Tezos Commons:** Aims to foster the development and adoption of the Tezos ecosystem through community engagement and grants.
- **Nomadic Labs:** One of the R&D teams that actively contribute to the Tezos core protocol.

### Notable Projects

Several projects [leverage](../l/leverage.md) Tezos for their applications, emphasizing the flexibility and [utility](../u/utility.md) of the protocol:

- **StakerDAO:** A platform for decentralized decision-making on [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) and investments.
- **tzBTC:** A Tezos-native token that is fully backed one-to-one with [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md).

## Advantages and Challenges

### Advantages

- **Flexibility:** The ability to implement protocol upgrades without hard forks makes Tezos one of the most flexible [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) platforms.
- **[Scalability](../s/scalability.md):** Delegated Proof-of-Stake consensus allows for higher [transaction](../t/transaction.md) [throughput](../t/throughput.md) and energy [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md).
- **[Security](../s/security.md):** Features like formal verification and the secure DPoS model make Tezos a secure platform for critical applications.

### Challenges

- **Complexity:** The intricate governance model and formal verification can be challenging for new developers and users to grasp.
- **Adoption:** While Tezos has a growing ecosystem, it still faces stiff competition from more established platforms like [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) and newer ones like Polkadot and Solana.

## Future Prospects

The future of Tezos looks promising given its unique governance model, [robust](../r/robust.md) [security](../s/security.md) features, and flexible mechanism for upgrades. As more developers adopt the platform and more partnerships are formed, Tezos is poised for significant growth and increased adoption in various industries, including [finance](../f/finance.md), [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md), and decentralized [finance](../f/finance.md) (DeFi).

### Improvements and Upgrades

Tezos continually works on upgrades to enhance performance, [scalability](../s/scalability.md), and [security](../s/security.md). For example, the Edo [upgrade](../u/upgrade.md) introduced Sapling, a privacy protocol, and BLS12-381, a curve for zk-SNARKs. These features provide new capabilities for developers and users.

### Community Involvement

The Tezos community is actively involved in shaping the platform's future. They participate in governance, contribute to development, and support new projects through grants and collaborations. This community-driven approach ensures that Tezos evolves in line with the needs and preferences of its stakeholders.

## Conclusion

Tezos represents a groundbreaking approach to [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology. Its self-amending protocol, [on-chain governance](../o/on-chain_governance.md), and focus on [security](../s/security.md) through formal verification position it as a strong contender in the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) space. While challenges remain, the ongoing developments and active community involvement make Tezos a vital player to watch in the evolving landscape of decentralized technologies.

# Tender

A tender is a formal invitation to [trade](../t/trade.md) under the conditions specified in the document. It refers to the process of inviting bids for large projects, typically by government institutions or corporations. These bids are usually [open](../o/open.md) to the public to promote competitive pricing and [transparency](../t/transparency.md) in project [execution](../e/execution.md).

## Types of Tenders

### 1. Open Tendering
[Open](../o/open.md) tendering is the most common type of tender. It is a public process where any interested supplier or contractor can submit a [bid](../b/bid.md). The process is competitive and aimed at achieving the best [value](../v/value.md) for [money](../m/money.md). This type of tender is usually advertised in public domains such as newspapers, official websites, or government portals.

### 2. Selective Tendering
Selective tendering is an invitational method, where pre-qualified suppliers or contractors are invited to submit bids. It is used to ensure that only reputable and capable companies are considered, which can save time and improve the quality of submissions.

### 3. Negotiated Tendering
Negotiated tendering is when the client negotiates with one or more contractors or suppliers and chooses one with the best terms. This type of tendering is common in complex projects where the client's requirements can only be met by a few qualified suppliers or contractors.

### 4. Two-Stage Tendering
Two-stage tendering is used when project requirements are not fully defined. It involves a first stage where bids are submitted on limited information (usually design and cost elements). Based on the initial submissions, a shortlist is made, and a more detailed second stage follows.

### 5. Multi-Stage Tendering
Multi-stage tendering involves several rounds of bidding and evaluation. It is employed for exceptionally large and complex projects. Each stage aims to refine the project [scope](../s/scope.md), design, and costs to ensure comprehensive and competitive final bids.

## Tendering Process

### 1. Preparing the Tender Document
The tender document is critical and includes various sections like:

- **Instructions to Bidders:** This section provides guidelines on how to prepare and submit the tender, deadlines, and evaluation criteria.
- **Specifications:** Detailed project requirements, [scope](../s/scope.md), and results expected from the supplier or contractor.
- **Terms and Conditions:** Legal and financial terms, including [payment](../p/payment.md) schedules, and other contractual [obligations](../o/obligation.md).
- **Forms and Declarations:** Standard forms that bidders must complete, such as submission forms, bidderâ€™s declaration, and confidentiality agreements.

### 2. Advertisement
The tender is advertised publicly if it is an [open](../o/open.md) tender. For selective tenders, pre-qualified bidders are directly invited.

### 3. Submission of Bids
Bidders prepare and submit their bids by the given deadlines. Bids usually include technical proposals, financial quotations, and other requisite documents.

### 4. Opening of Bids
Submitted bids are officially opened in a transparent process, often in the presence of parties involved, to maintain fairness.

### 5. Evaluation of Bids
Bids are evaluated based on previously outlined criteria such as cost, technical capability, and compliance with specifications. Often, this stage includes a scoring system.

### 6. Award of Contract
The bidder with the highest score or the most favorable terms is awarded the contract. An official notification of the award is issued to the winning bidder.

### 7. Contract Execution
Both parties sign the contract, and the project commences as per the agreed terms.

## Importance of Tendering

### 1. Transparency
Tendering promotes [transparency](../t/transparency.md) in project [execution](../e/execution.md) by making the requirements and selection process [open](../o/open.md) to scrutiny.

### 2. Competitive Pricing
It encourages competition among suppliers and contractors, leading to more efficient use of resources and reduced costs.

### 3. Quality Assurance
Through selective and multi-stage tendering processes, clients can ensure that only qualified and capable bidders meet the project's technical and commercial requirements.

## Technology in Tendering

### E-Tendering
The advent of technology has revolutionized the tendering process with e-tendering. This online process reduces paperwork, speeds up communication, and enhances [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md).

### Tender Management Software
Various software solutions like Jaggaer, SAP Ariba, and Procore aid in managing the tendering process. These tools help in:

- Document management
- Communication between stakeholders
- [Bid](../b/bid.md) comparisons and evaluations
- Streamlined submission processes

### Blockchain in Tendering
[Blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology is finding its way into tendering processes to add further layers of [security](../s/security.md), [transparency](../t/transparency.md), and immutability. Through [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md), it can automate the awarding process, ensure compliance, and reduce disputes.

## Challenges in Tendering

### 1. Bid Rigging
[Collusion](../c/collusion.md) among bidders to manipulate the tendering process remains a glaring [issue](../i/issue.md). Regulatory bodies keep a close watch to curb such practices.

### 2. Complexity
Large projects often involve complex and lengthy tendering processes which can be resource-intensive and time-consuming.

### 3. Costs
Preparing a comprehensive tender response can be costly for bidders, particularly for those who do not win the contract.

### 4. Legal Disputes
Disputes may arise over contract terms, evaluation criteria, or [bid](../b/bid.md) rejection, leading to legal confrontations that can delay project [execution](../e/execution.md).

## Key Players

### 1. Governments
Governments frequently use the tendering process for public works, [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) projects, and [procurement](../p/procurement.md) of goods and services to ensure fair and transparent use of [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) [money](../m/money.md).

### 2. Corporations
Large corporations use tendering to manage third-party contracts, ensuring they receive quality work at competitive prices.

### 3. Suppliers and Contractors
These are the entities that respond to tenders, providing bids to win projects or [supply](../s/supply.md) goods and services.

## Examples of Tendering Platforms

### 1. [Tenders Direct](https://www.tendersdirect.co.uk)
A UK-based platform that provides access to public sector contract opportunities.

### 2. [Government eMarketplace (GeM)](https://gem.gov.in)
An Indian government initiative to create an [open](../o/open.md) and transparent [procurement](../p/procurement.md) system for government departments and organizations.

### 3. [EU Tenders](https://ted.europa.eu/TED/main/HomePage.do)
The [European Union](../e/european_union_(eu).md)'s tendering portal, providing access to tender opportunities from across the EU.

## Conclusion

Tendering is a fundamental process in [project management](../p/project_management.md), [procurement](../p/procurement.md), and [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md) management, providing a structured and fair mechanism for selecting suppliers and contractors. While it brings numerous benefits in terms of [transparency](../t/transparency.md), competition, and quality [assurance](../a/assurance.md), it also comes with its challenges. The integration of technology and regulatory frameworks continues to evolve, making the tendering process more efficient and reliable.

Leveraging tools like e-tendering platforms, tender management software, and [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technologies can address many current challenges and further harness the advantages of tendering for stakeholders worldwide.

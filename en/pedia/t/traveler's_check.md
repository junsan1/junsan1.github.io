# Traveler's Check

A traveler's [check](../c/check.md) (or traveller's cheque) is a pre-printed, fixed-amount [check](../c/check.md) designed to allow the person signing it to make an unconditional [payment](../p/payment.md) to someone else as a result of having paid the [issuer](../i/issuer.md), usually a [bank](../b/bank.md), for that privilege. Once widely used by those on vacation instead of carrying large amounts of cash, traveler's checks have declined in use with the advent of ATM machines and [credit](../c/credit.md) and [debit](../d/debit.md) cards.

## Historical Context and Creation

Traveler's checks originated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as a safe and convenient way for travelers to carry [money](../m/money.md), especially when traveling internationally. The first traveler's [check](../c/check.md) was issued in 1891 by the American Express Company.

### Early Adoption and Popularity

The development of traveler's checks was driven by the need for a secure form of [money](../m/money.md) that could be easily converted into local [currency](../c/currency.md). The primary advantages of traveler's checks were their relatively small size, lightweight, and the fact that they could be replaced if lost or stolen, unlike cash.

## Features of Traveler's Checks

### Pre-Print Structure

Traveler's checks come in fixed denominations which can be tailored to the needs of the traveler. Each [check](../c/check.md) features:

- A unique [check](../c/check.md) number for identification.
- Space for the [payee](../p/payee.md)â€™s name.
- Signature lines: one for signing when the [check](../c/check.md) is purchased and one for signing when it is used.
- Instructions for replacement in case of theft or loss.

### Security Measures

Traveler's checks [offer](../o/offer.md) several [security](../s/security.md) measures, making them safer to use than cash:

1. **Dual Signature System**: The buyer must sign the [check](../c/check.md) both at the time of purchase and at the time of use, ensuring that the cashier or merchant can verify the authenticity of the [check](../c/check.md).
2. **Serial Numbers**: Each traveler's [check](../c/check.md) has a unique serial number which can be tracked.
3. **Counterfeit Protection**: Advanced printing technologies are used to prevent forgery, including watermarks, microprinting, and holograms.

## How Traveler's Checks Work

1. **Purchase**: The traveler buys the checks from a [bank](../b/bank.md) or financial institution, paying the equivalent [value](../v/value.md) plus a [commission](../c/commission.md) [fee](../f/fee.md).
2. **Backup List**: The buyer is advised to make a list of the serial numbers of all acquired checks and keep this separate from the checks for [security](../s/security.md) purposes.
3. **Usage**: A traveler must countersign the [check](../c/check.md) in the presence of the cashier when making a purchase.
4. **Replacement**: If a [check](../c/check.md) is lost or stolen, the traveler must contact the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) to stop [payment](../p/payment.md) and request a replacement, using the list of serial numbers as evidence.

### Conversion to Local Currencies

Traveler's checks can be converted into local currencies at banks and [exchange](../e/exchange.md) offices worldwide. The [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates and fees may vary, making it important for travelers to inquire about the rates before cashing their checks.

## Decline of Traveler's Checks

The usage of traveler's checks has significantly declined due to the introduction and widespread adoption of:

1. **ATM Cards**: Automated Teller Machines allow travelers to withdraw local currencies directly using their [debit](../d/debit.md) or [credit](../c/credit.md) cards.
2. **[Credit](../c/credit.md) Cards**: [Credit](../c/credit.md) cards [offer](../o/offer.md) convenience and [security](../s/security.md), and come with benefits such as [travel insurance](../t/travel_insurance.md) and rewards programs.
3. **Prepaid Travel Cards**: These act like [debit](../d/debit.md) cards but are preloaded with funds that can be used worldwide.
4. **Mobile Payments**: Digital wallets and [payment](../p/payment.md) apps such as [PayPal](../p/paypal.md), Apple Pay, and Google Wallet [offer](../o/offer.md) secure transactions.

1. **Remote Locations**: In regions with limited or no access to modern banking [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md).

## Conclusion

However, understanding the history of traveler's checks provides valuable insights into the development of secure financial instruments and the ongoing quest for safe, reliable, and convenient ways to manage [money](../m/money.md) while on the move.

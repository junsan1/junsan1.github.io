# Errors and Omissions Insurance (E&O)

Errors and Omissions [insurance](../i/insurance.md) (E&O), also known as Professional [Liability Insurance](../l/liability_insurance.md), is a type of [liability insurance](../l/liability_insurance.md) specifically designed to protect individuals and companies from bearing the full cost of defense and indemnity for lawsuits related to professional services they provide. These lawsuits typically involve claims of negligence, errors, or omissions in the performance of professional duties. E&O [insurance](../i/insurance.md) covers legal costs, including attorney fees, court costs, and any settlements or judgments awarded against the insured.

## Importance of E&O Insurance

The significance of E&O [insurance](../i/insurance.md) cannot be overstated, as any professional service provider faces the [risk](../r/risk.md) of being sued for negligence, mistakes, or failure to deliver promised results. The [insurance](../i/insurance.md) serves as a safeguard against potentially devastating financial ramifications stemming from legal actions. Here are several key reasons why E&O [insurance](../i/insurance.md) is vital:

1. **Financial Protection**: Legal battles can be financially ruinous, especially for small businesses and individual practitioners. E&O [insurance](../i/insurance.md) covers legal fees and any settlements or court-awarded damages.
2. **Professional Integrity**: Carrying E&O [insurance](../i/insurance.md) can enhance a service provider’s reputation, signaling to clients that the [firm](../f/firm.md) is professional, responsible, and prepared for potential risks.
3. **Client Confidence**: Clients may require service providers to carry E&O [insurance](../i/insurance.md) before entering into contracts, providing an extra layer of [assurance](../a/assurance.md) that they [will](../w/will.md) be compensated in case of professional negligence.
4. **Contractual Requirement**: Many industries mandate E&O coverage as a condition of licensure or [business](../b/business.md) agreements. Without this [insurance](../i/insurance.md), professionals might not be able to fulfill contractual [obligations](../o/obligation.md) with clients.

## Coverage Details

E&O [insurance](../i/insurance.md) policies generally cover a wide [range](../r/range.md) of errors, omissions, and negligent acts. Here’s a closer look at what these policies include:

### Acts Covered

### Additional Coverage Features

1. **Defense Costs**: Legal fees, court costs, and other expenses incurred in defending a lawsuit.
2. **Settlements and Judgments**: Amounts paid to settle a lawsuit or judgments awarded by the court.
3. **Claims Made [Basis](../b/basis.md)**: Most E&O policies operate on a claims-made [basis](../b/basis.md), meaning that they cover claims made during the policy period, regardless of when the alleged error or omission occurred.

### Exclusions

Though E&O [insurance](../i/insurance.md) is comprehensive, there are certain exclusions, including but not limited to:

1. **Intentional Acts**: Fraudulent, illegal, or malicious acts committed by the insured.

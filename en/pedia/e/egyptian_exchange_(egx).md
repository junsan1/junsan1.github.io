# Egyptian Exchange (EGX)

The Egyptian Exchange (EGX) is the principal stock exchange of Egypt, playing a critical role in the nation's financial system. It provides a regulated marketplace for the trading of securities such as stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments. Below, we dive into various aspects of EGX, exploring its history, structure, trading mechanisms, products, and its impact on the Egyptian and global economy.

## History of EGX

The roots of Egyptian capital markets date back over a century, though the modern iteration of EGX stems from the amalgamation of two historic bourses: the Cairo Stock Exchange and the Alexandria Stock Exchange. The Cairo Stock Exchange was established in 1903, while Alexandria's counterpart came to life in 1883. In 1907, the markets in Cairo and Alexandria were formally merged to create the Egyptian Exchange in its current form.

## Structure and Governance

EGX operates under the governance of Egypt’s Financial Regulatory Authority (FRA). It is a member of the Federation of Euro-Asian Stock Exchanges (FEAS) and the African Securities Exchanges Association (ASEA).

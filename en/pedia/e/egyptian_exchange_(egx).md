# Egyptian Exchange (EGX)

The Egyptian [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (EGX) is the [principal](../p/principal.md) stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md) of Egypt, playing a critical role in the nation's [financial system](../f/financial_system.md). It provides a regulated marketplace for the trading of securities such as [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, and other financial instruments. Below, we dive into various aspects of EGX, exploring its history, structure, trading mechanisms, products, and its impact on the Egyptian and global [economy](../e/economy.md).

## History of EGX

The roots of Egyptian [capital markets](../c/capital_markets.md) date back over a century, though the modern iteration of EGX stems from the [amalgamation](../a/amalgamation.md) of two historic bourses: the Cairo Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) and the Alexandria Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md). The Cairo Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) was established in 1903, while Alexandria's counterpart came to life in 1883. In 1907, the markets in Cairo and Alexandria were formally merged to create the Egyptian [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) in its current form.

## Structure and Governance

EGX operates under the governance of Egypt’s Financial Regulatory Authority (FRA). It is a member of the Federation of [Euro](../e/euro.md)-Asian Stock Exchanges (FEAS) and the African Securities Exchanges Association (ASEA). The [exchange](../e/exchange.md) is overseen by a Board of Directors that includes representatives from various segments of the financial [industry](../i/industry.md), ensuring diverse oversight.

EGX's [organizational structure](../o/organizational_structure.md) comprises several key components:

- **Board of Directors**: Comprising [industry](../i/industry.md) experts, financial analysts, and government representatives.

## Trading Mechanisms

EGX adopts an electronic trading system known as X-Stream INET, provided by [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md). This system allows for the efficient and transparent [execution](../e/execution.md) of trades. EGX has implemented various trading sessions and rules to ensure smooth operations:

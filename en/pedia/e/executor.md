## Key Responsibilities
1. **[Probate](../p/probate.md) Process**: Filing the [will](../w/will.md) with the [probate court](../p/probate_court.md) and managing the [probate](../p/probate.md) process, which involves validating the [will](../w/will.md), inventorying the [estate](../e/estate.md), and distributing assets.
2. **[Asset Management](../a/asset_management.md)**: Collecting and managing the deceased's assets, including [bank](../b/bank.md) accounts, investments, [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), and [personal property](../p/personal_property.md).

3. **Corporate Executor**: An institution, such as a [bank](../b/bank.md) or [trust company](../t/trust_company.md), appointed to act as the executor, providing professional [estate](../e/estate.md) management services.

## Challenges and Considerations
1. **[Conflict of Interest](../c/conflict_of_interest.md)**: Potential conflicts of [interest](../i/interest.md) can arise if the executor is also a [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md). Clear communication and impartial decision-making are essential.

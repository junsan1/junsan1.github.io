# Equity Accounting

[Equity](../e/equity.md) [accounting](../a/accounting.md), also known as the [equity method](../e/equity_method.md) of [accounting](../a/accounting.md), is a type of [accounting](../a/accounting.md) used by firms to assess the profits earned through their investments in other companies. This contrasts with [consolidation](../c/consolidation.md), wherein a [parent company](../p/parent_company.md) incorporates all the financial results of a subsidiary into its own [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md). The [equity method](../e/equity_method.md) is typically applied when a company has significant influence over the entity in which it has invested, generally assumed to be the case when ownership meets or exceeds 20% while keeping it below 50%, as beyond that threshold, the ownership signifies control, necessitating [consolidation](../c/consolidation.md).

## The Basics of Equity Accounting

In [equity](../e/equity.md) [accounting](../a/accounting.md), the initial investment is recorded at cost. Subsequently, the carrying amount of this investment is adjusted to reflect the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s share of the net [profit](../p/profit.md) or loss of the investee, reduced by dividends received from the investee. 

The key principle lies in reflecting the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s share of the investee's [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) in the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md), underlining that the [investor](../i/investor.md) has influenced the investee's operations and indirectly [shares](../s/shares.md) its financial gains and setbacks.

### Initial Recognition

Upon acquiring a stake in another company, the [investor](../i/investor.md) records the investment at the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) cost. This entry appears on the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) as a non-current [asset](../a/asset.md). 

The [journal](../j/journal.md) entry for the initial investment would generally look like:

```markdown
[Debit](../d/debit.md): Investment in Associate ([Asset](../a/asset.md))
[Credit](../c/credit.md): Cash ([Asset](../a/asset.md))
```

### Subsequent Measurement

After the initial recognition, the investment is adjusted periodically to account for the [investor](../i/investor.md)’s share of the investee’s [profit](../p/profit.md) or loss. For example, if the investee earns a [profit](../p/profit.md), the [investor](../i/investor.md) [will](../w/will.md) increase the carrying amount of the investment according to its percentage share in the investee's [earnings](../e/earnings.md). Conversely, the carrying amount is decreased if the investee reports a loss. Dividends received from the investee reduce the carrying amount of the investment.

For instance, if the investee reports a [profit](../p/profit.md) of $100,000 and the [investor](../i/investor.md) owns a 30% stake, the adjustment in [journal](../j/journal.md) entries would be:

```markdown
[Debit](../d/debit.md): Investment in Associate ([Asset](../a/asset.md)) $30,000
[Credit](../c/credit.md): Share of [Profit](../p/profit.md) of Associate ([Income](../i/income.md)) $30,000
```

Similarly, if the investee declares and pays dividends worth $50,000, the [journal](../j/journal.md) entry would be:

```markdown
[Debit](../d/debit.md): Cash ([Asset](../a/asset.md)) $15,000  (30% of $50,000)
[Credit](../c/credit.md): Investment in Associate ([Asset](../a/asset.md)) $15,000
```

### Impairment Loss

An [impairment](../i/impairment.md) loss needs to be recognized if the carrying amount of the investment exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) less costs to sell and its [value](../v/value.md) in use.

The [journal](../j/journal.md) entry for recording an [impairment](../i/impairment.md) loss could look like:

```markdown
[Debit](../d/debit.md): [Impairment](../i/impairment.md) Loss ([Expense](../e/expense.md))
[Credit](../c/credit.md): Investment in Associate ([Asset](../a/asset.md))
```

### Discontinuation of Equity Method

If the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s stake falls below the significant influence threshold or if the investee undergoes drastic financial changes, leading to a lack of significant influence, the [equity method](../e/equity_method.md) [will](../w/will.md) discontinue.

The investment's carrying amount on the date [equity method](../e/equity_method.md) ceases [will](../w/will.md) be its new [cost basis](../c/cost_basis.md).

### Example Scenario

Let's consider a practical example to illustrate [equity](../e/equity.md) [accounting](../a/accounting.md) more comprehensively. Assume Company A acquires a 25% [interest](../i/interest.md) in Company B for $1,000,000, which has net assets of $4,000,000. Over the next year, Company B reports a total net [income](../i/income.md) of $200,000 and pays out $50,000 in dividends.

The steps Company A would follow are:

1. **Initial Investment:**
    ```markdown
    [Debit](../d/debit.md): Investment in B $1,000,000
    [Credit](../c/credit.md): Cash $1,000,000
    ```

2. **Recording Share of [Income](../i/income.md):**
    Company A's share of Company B's [income](../i/income.md) would be 25% of $200,000, which is $50,000.
    ```markdown
    [Debit](../d/debit.md): Investment in B $50,000
    [Credit](../c/credit.md): Share of [Profit](../p/profit.md) of B $50,000
    ```

3. **Recording Share of Dividends:**
    Company A's share of dividends would be 25% of $50,000, which amounts to $12,500.
    ```markdown
    [Debit](../d/debit.md): Cash $12,500
    [Credit](../c/credit.md): Investment in B $12,500
    ```

The year-end balance of the Investment in B would be:
```
$1,000,000 (initial investment) + $50,000 (share of [profit](../p/profit.md)) - $12,500 (share of dividends) = $1,037,500.
```

- [FASB ASC 323](https://asc.fasb.org/section&trid=2120784)

## Challenges and Considerations

### Significant Judgment

Determining significant influence requires considerable [judgment](../j/judgment.md). Factors include representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making processes, and material transactions between [investor](../i/investor.md) and investee.

### Impairment Testing

Regularly testing the investment for [impairment](../i/impairment.md) can be challenging and requires rigorous analysis to determine the recoverable amount.

### Complex Financial Instruments

Investments that involve complex financial instruments may necessitate sophisticated [accounting](../a/accounting.md) models to accurately apply the [equity method](../e/equity_method.md).

### Changes in Ownership

Frequent changes in ownership percentages might require adjustments in the [accounting method](../a/accounting_method.md), impacting comparability and the consistency of [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md).

### Compliance and Disclosure

Regulatory compliance and [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) requirements are stringent, necessitating detailed disclosures in [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) about the application of the [equity method](../e/equity_method.md), the [investor](../i/investor.md)’s share of the investee’s net assets, and potential risks.

## Conclusion

[Equity](../e/equity.md) [accounting](../a/accounting.md) serves as a crucial method for recognizing and reporting the [value](../v/value.md) of strategic investments in [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md), reflecting economic influence without [consolidation](../c/consolidation.md). While it presents certain challenges, rigorous adherence to [accounting](../a/accounting.md) standards and transparent disclosures can significantly enhance the reliability and comparability of financial reporting. Through regular updates and thorough inspections of investments, companies employing the [equity method](../e/equity_method.md) can provide stakeholders with a comprehensive and accurate view of their financial positioning in relation to their significant investees.

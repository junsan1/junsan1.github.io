# Electronic Fund Transfer Act

The Electronic [Fund](../f/fund.md) Transfer Act (EFTA), enacted by the United States Congress in 1978, is a federal law that establishes the rights and liabilities of consumers as well as the responsibilities of financial institutions regarding electronic [fund](../f/fund.md) transfers (EFTs). These transfers include many common [retail banking](../r/retail_banking.md) activities such as ATM transactions, direct deposits, and [online banking](../o/online_banking.md). The EFTA aims to protect consumers and ensure the [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md), [transparency](../t/transparency.md), and [security](../s/security.md) of EFTs. It also addresses issues related to unauthorized use, dispute resolution, and error [correction](../c/correction.md) procedures.

## Key Components of EFTA

### Coverage

The EFTA applies to several types of electronic [fund](../f/fund.md) transfers, including:

- **Automated Teller Machine (ATM) transactions:** Withdrawals, deposits, balance inquiries, and [fund](../f/fund.md) transfers performed via ATMs.
- **Direct Deposits and Withdrawals:** [Payroll](../p/payroll.md) deposits directly transferred to an employeeâ€™s [bank](../b/bank.md) account and automatic payments for recurring bills.
- **Point of [Sale](../s/sale.md) (POS) Transfers:** Purchases made using [debit](../d/debit.md) cards at retail locations.
- **Telephone Transfers:** Initiated through a phone call, enabling monetary transfers between accounts.
- **Online Transactions:** Internet banking activities such as electronic bill payments and online purchases.

### Consumer Rights

1. **[Disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) Requirements:** Financial institutions must provide clear information about the terms and conditions of EFT services. These include [transaction fees](../t/transaction_fees.md), types of transfers allowed, and the consumer's [liability](../l/liability.md) in case of unauthorized transfers.

2. **Periodic Statements:** Banks are required to send periodic statements detailing all electronic transactions, including their dates, amounts, and types of transactions carried out during the reporting period.

3. **Error Resolution:** Consumers have the right to prompt investigation and resolution of errors. They must notify their financial institution of any suspected errors within 60 days of receiving the statement. The institution must investigate and resolve the [issue](../i/issue.md) within 45 days, with a provisional [credit](../c/credit.md) issued if necessary.

4. **Unauthorized Transfers:** Consumer [liability](../l/liability.md) for unauthorized transfers is limited, depending on how quickly they report the unauthorized activity. If reported within two [business](../b/business.md) days of discovering the loss or theft, [liability](../l/liability.md) is capped at $50. If reported after two days but within 60 days, [liability](../l/liability.md) is limited to $500. Beyond 60 days, the consumer may face [unlimited liability](../u/unlimited_liability.md) for unauthorized transactions.

### Financial Institution Responsibilities

1. **Prompt Error Resolution:** Financial institutions must investigate and resolve EFT errors reported by consumers within specific timeframes, as mentioned above.

2. **Documentation and [Receipts](../r/receipt.md):** Institutions must provide [receipts](../r/receipt.md) for ATM and POS transactions, detailing the amount, date, and type of [transaction](../t/transaction.md).

3. **Dispute Handling:** Institutions must manage disputes effectively and provide provisional credits during the investigation periods if consumers claim unauthorized transactions or errors.

### Preauthorized Transfers

Consumers can authorize recurring automatic transfers such as salary deposits or bill payments. The EFTA mandates that consumers be notified of the terms before such transfers commence and have the ability to stop preauthorized transfers by informing their financial institution at least three [business](../b/business.md) days before the scheduled date.

### Safe Electronic Transactions

The EFTA promotes the [security](../s/security.md) of electronic transactions through various regulations. These include requirements for [robust](../r/robust.md) encryption, multi-[factor](../f/factor.md) authentication, and prompt anti-[fraud](../f/fraud.md) measures. Financial institutions are expected to stay updated with evolving cybersecurity threats and implement necessary safeguards to protect consumer funds and personal information.

### Amendments and Updates

The EFTA has been amended several times to address new challenges and emerging technologies in the financial services sector. One significant amendment is the Electronic [Fund](../f/fund.md) Transfer Amendments Act, which introduced additional consumer protections and extended the EFTA's reach to new types of electronic transactions.

### Implementation and Enforcement

The Federal Reserve Board initially implemented regulations for the EFTA, known as Regulation E. Responsibility for enforcing the EFTA and updating Regulation E was later transferred to the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB) as part of the [Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act](../d/dodd-frank_wall_street_reform_and_consumer_protection_act.md) of 2010.

Financial institutions are subject to regular examinations and audits to ensure compliance with EFTA requirements. Violations can result in substantial penalties and corrective actions.

## Impact on Financial Services

The EFTA revolutionized the financial services [industry](../i/industry.md) by enabling secure, efficient, and transparent electronic transactions. It paved the way for innovations like [online banking](../o/online_banking.md), mobile [payment](../p/payment.md) apps, and peer-to-peer [payment](../p/payment.md) systems. Consumers gained increased convenience and control over their finances, while financial institutions improved their service delivery and [customer](../c/customer.md) engagement.

The EFTA continues to play a critical role in shaping the future of electronic payments, adapting to new technologies and responding to the evolving needs of consumers and businesses.

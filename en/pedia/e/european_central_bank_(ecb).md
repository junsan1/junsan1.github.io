# European Central Bank (ECB)

## Introduction to the European Central Bank

The European Central [Bank](../b/bank.md) (ECB) is a critical monetary institution within the [European Union](../e/european_union_(eu).md) (EU) tasked with overseeing the [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) of the [Eurozone](../e/eurozone.md), which includes 19 of the 27 EU member states that use the [euro](../e/euro.md) (€) as their [currency](../c/currency.md). Established on June 1, 1998, the ECB was created to ensure price stability within the [Eurozone](../e/eurozone.md) and to manage [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) to support economic stability and growth. 

## Role and Objectives of the ECB

### Primary Mandate: Price Stability
The central objective of the ECB is to maintain price stability. This involves keeping [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rates under control, typically aiming for a target close to, but below, 2% over the medium term. Price stability fosters [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) and helps maintain the [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) of the [euro](../e/euro.md).

### Secondary Objectives
While price stability is the primary mandate, the ECB has several secondary objectives which must support the general economic policies in the EU. These include:
- Supporting sustainable [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md).
- Promoting [full employment](../f/full_employment.md).
- Ensuring the stability of the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md).
- Integrating financial and [capital markets](../c/capital_markets.md).

## Structure and Governance

### Governing Council
The Governing Council is the main decision-making body of the ECB. It consists of the Executive Board and the governors of the national central banks of the [Eurozone](../e/eurozone.md) countries. The Governing Council formulates [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) and makes decisions on the implementation of ECB objectives.

### Executive Board
The Executive Board is responsible for the implementation of [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) as determined by the Governing Council. It consists of six members:
- The President
- The Vice-President
- Four other members 

### General Council
The General Council, which includes the President and Vice-President of the ECB and the governors of the national central banks of all EU member states, has a consultative function.

### Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board is responsible for banking supervision within the [Eurozone](../e/eurozone.md), ensuring that [credit](../c/credit.md) institutions adhere to the prudential regulations established by the ECB.

### Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTROs)
TLTROs are ECB operations that provide long-term loans to banks in the [Eurozone](../e/eurozone.md). These loans are intended to improve [bank](../b/bank.md) lending to the real [economy](../e/economy.md).

## Monetary Policy Instruments

To achieve its mandate, the ECB employs several [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) instruments:

### Open Market Operations
[Open market operations](../o/open_market_operations.md) are the primary tool for controlling [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) in the [Eurozone](../e/eurozone.md) [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). They include:
- Main Refinancing Operations (MROs)
- Longer-Term Refinancing Operations (LTROs)
- Fine-Tuning Operations (FTOs)
- Structural Operations

### Interest Rates
The ECB sets three key [interest](../i/interest.md) rates:
- The main refinancing rate, which is the rate at which banks can borrow from the ECB.
- The [deposit](../d/deposit.md) [facility](../f/facility.md) rate, which is the rate which banks receive for their overnight deposits.
- The marginal lending [facility](../f/facility.md) rate, which is the rate at which banks can receive overnight [credit](../c/credit.md) from the ECB.

### Asset Purchase Program (APP)
The ECB’s APP involves the purchase of public and [private sector](../p/private_sector.md) securities in [order](../o/order.md) to inject [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) into the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md), stimulate economic activity, and push [inflation](../i/inflation.md) towards the target.

### Quantitative Easing (QE)
[Quantitative easing](../q/quantitative_easing.md) is a form of APP aimed at increasing [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) by purchasing securities, thereby lowering [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and increasing lending and investment.

### Negative Interest Rate Policy (NIRP)
The ECB has sometimes employed negative [interest](../i/interest.md) rates to encourage banks to lend more to businesses and consumers, rather than keeping their [money](../m/money.md) in the ECB’s [deposit](../d/deposit.md) [facility](../f/facility.md).

## Banking Supervision and Financial Stability

With the onset of the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md), the ECB’s role expanded to include banking supervision within the [Eurozone](../e/eurozone.md) through the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). This system ensures the safety and soundness of the European banking system.

## International Cooperation

The ECB is an integral part of global monetary cooperation, working closely with other central banks such as the Federal Reserve and the [Bank](../b/bank.md) of Japan, and participating in institutions like the International Monetary [Fund](../f/fund.md) (IMF) and the [Bank](../b/bank.md) for International Settlements (BIS).

## Research and Publications

The ECB is actively involved in economic research and regularly publishes reports and working papers. These publications cover areas such as [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md), economic forecasts, financial stability assessments, and macroeconomic [statistics](../s/statistics.md). Publications include the Economic Bulletin, Financial Stability Review, and various occasional papers.

## Conclusion

The European Central [Bank](../b/bank.md) plays a crucial role in guiding the [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) of the [Eurozone](../e/eurozone.md), with an overarching goal of maintaining price stability while supporting broader economic objectives. Its extensive toolkit and evolving strategies make it a central player in both European and global financial systems. By ensuring financial stability and fostering sustainable [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md), the ECB directly impacts the daily lives of millions of European citizens.

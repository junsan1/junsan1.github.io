# Emerging Markets Bond Index (EMBI)

The Emerging Markets [Bond](../b/bond.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (EMBI) is a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md) that measures the [total return](../t/total_return.md) performance of international government bonds issued by emerging [market](../m/market.md) countries, often denominated in hard currencies such as the US dollar, [euro](../e/euro.md), and yen. It is developed and maintained by J.P. Morgan, a global leader in financial services. 

## Overview

The EMBI provides investors with exposure to [debt](../d/debt.md) from a diverse [range](../r/range.md) of emerging [market](../m/market.md) economies. These markets include countries from Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. Since these regions historically [offer](../o/offer.md) higher yields due to higher [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with their economic and political environments, the EMBI serves as a useful gauge for the health and performance of the emerging [market](../m/market.md) [debt](../d/debt.md) sector.

## Key Features

### Composition

The EMBI includes various types of [debt](../d/debt.md) securities, predominantly sovereign bonds but also quasi-sovereign (state-owned enterprises) and corporate bonds from emerging markets. The inclusion criteria involve [market](../m/market.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), the [credit](../c/credit.md) quality of the [issuer](../i/issuer.md), and the [maturity](../m/maturity.md) of the [debt](../d/debt.md) instruments.

### Currency

The EMBI mainly tracks bonds issued in hard currencies such as the US dollar. This focus on hard currencies helps mitigate [foreign exchange risk](../f/foreign_exchange_risk.md) for investors, making the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) an appealing choice for those looking to invest in emerging markets without the added complexity of dealing with [multiple](../m/multiple.md), often volatile, emerging [market](../m/market.md) currencies.

### Duration and Yield

The [duration](../d/duration.md) of the bonds in the EMBI can vary widely, but the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) typically includes a mix of short-term, medium-term, and [long-term debt](../l/long-term_debt.md) instruments. The [yield](../y/yield.md) on these bonds is influenced by factors such as [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md), [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) environment, and overall [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md) in the issuing countries.

## Variants

There are several variants of the EMBI to cater to different investment needs and preferences. These variants include:

1. **EMBI Global**: This variant includes more countries and has broader [market](../m/market.md) coverage. It is often used by global investors seeking a comprehensive assessment of emerging [market](../m/market.md) [debt](../d/debt.md).
   
2. **EMBI+ (Plus)**: Focuses on a select group of more [liquid](../l/liquid.md) and creditworthy emerging [market](../m/market.md) bonds. It offers a more conservative investment option within the space.

3. **GBI-EM ([Government Bond](../g/government_bond.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) - Emerging Markets)**: Tracks local [currency](../c/currency.md) bonds of emerging [market](../m/market.md) governments, [offering](../o/offering.md) exposure to local [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and [currency](../c/currency.md) movements.

4. **CEMBI (Corporate Emerging Markets [Bond](../b/bond.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md))**: Tracks corporate bonds issued in emerging markets, allowing for an assessment of the corporate [debt](../d/debt.md) landscape in these regions. 

## Methodology

### Selection Criteria

J.P. Morgan applies several criteria to select the bonds included in the EMBI. These include:

- **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)**: Bonds must have a minimum size and meet certain trading [volume](../v/volume.md) requirements.
- **[Credit](../c/credit.md) Quality**: Bonds typically need to have a [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) of at least B- (or equivalent) from major [rating](../r/rating.md) agencies.
- **[Maturity](../m/maturity.md)**: The bonds must have a certain minimum remaining [maturity](../m/maturity.md) to be eligible for inclusion.

### Weighting

The bonds in the EMBI are [weighted](../w/weighted.md) by [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md), meaning that larger issues have a greater influence on the [index](../i/index_instrument.md)â€™s performance. This approach helps to reflect the actual investment opportunities available in the [market](../m/market.md). 

## Benefits and Risks

### Benefits

1. **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: Offers exposure to a wide [range](../r/range.md) of emerging markets, providing [diversification benefits](../d/diversification_benefits.md).
2. **Higher Yields**: Generally offers higher yields compared to developed [market](../m/market.md) bonds.
3. **[Hard Currency](../h/hard_currency.md) Exposure**: Primarily denominated in US dollars, reducing [foreign exchange risk](../f/foreign_exchange_risk.md).

### Risks

1. **[Credit Risk](../c/credit_risk.md)**: Emerging [market](../m/market.md) governments and corporations often have lower [credit](../c/credit.md) ratings, increasing the [risk](../r/risk.md) of [default](../d/default.md).
2. **Economic [Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: Subject to economic fluctuations and political instability in emerging markets.
3. **[Interest Rate Risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md)**: Sensitive to changes in global [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, which can affect [bond](../b/bond.md) prices.

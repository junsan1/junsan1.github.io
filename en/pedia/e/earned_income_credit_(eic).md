# Earned Income Credit (EIC)

The [Earned Income](../e/earned_income.md) [Credit](../c/credit.md) (EIC), also known as the [Earned Income](../e/earned_income.md) [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md) (EITC), is a refundable [tax credit](../t/tax_credit.md) designed to benefit low- to moderate-[income](../i/income.md) working individuals and families, particularly those with children. Enacted in 1975 as part of the Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Code, the primary goal of the EIC is to reduce the tax burden on these groups, supplement their [income](../i/income.md), and encourage employment.

## Overview

The EIC works by reducing the amount of tax owed and potentially providing a refund to those who qualify. It takes into account [income](../i/income.md), [filing status](../f/filing_status.md), and number of qualifying children, making it particularly beneficial to families with [multiple](../m/multiple.md) dependents. The [credit](../c/credit.md) is phased out at higher [income](../i/income.md) levels and differs depending on whether the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) has children and how many.

## Eligibility Criteria

Eligibility for the EIC hinges on several factors:

- **[Income](../i/income.md) Level**: Taxpayers must have [earned income](../e/earned_income.md) below certain thresholds, which are adjusted annually for [inflation](../i/inflation.md).
- **[Filing Status](../f/filing_status.md)**: Eligible filing statuses include Single, [Married Filing Jointly](../m/married_filing_jointly.md), [Head of Household](../h/head_of_household.md), and Qualifying Widow(er).
- **Qualifying Children**: The number of qualifying children significantly affects the amount of the [credit](../c/credit.md). 
- **[Investment Income](../i/investment_income.md)**: Taxpayers with excessive [investment income](../i/investment_income.md) are disqualified from claiming the EIC.
- **Residency**: The [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) and any qualifying children must reside in the United States for more than half the year.
- **SSNs**: Both the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) and any qualifying children must have valid [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) Numbers.
- **Age**: The [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) must be at least 25 years old but under 65 if they are claiming the EIC without children.

## Calculation of the EIC

The EIC is calculated based on the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md)'s [earned income](../e/earned_income.md) and adjusted [gross income](../g/gross_income.md) (AGI). The IRS provides a detailed table known as the EITC table annually, which outlines the [credit](../c/credit.md) amounts based on [income](../i/income.md), [filing status](../f/filing_status.md), and number of qualifying children.

1. **[Earned Income](../e/earned_income.md)**: This includes wages, salaries, tips, and other taxable employee pay. It also encompasses net [earnings](../e/earnings.md) from [self-employment](../s/self-employment.md).
2. **Phase-In and Phase-Out**: There are phase-in and phase-out ranges associated with the EIC. As [earned income](../e/earned_income.md) increases, the [credit](../c/credit.md) amount grows until it reaches a maximum [value](../v/value.md). Once [income](../i/income.md) surpasses specific levels, the [credit](../c/credit.md) begins to phase out until it reaches zero.

### Example of EIC Calculation:
Consider a family with two qualifying children and an [earned income](../e/earned_income.md) of $20,000. Suppose the maximum EIC amount for two children is $5,828, and the phase-out [income](../i/income.md) [range](../r/range.md) starts from $25,000.

1. The family falls within the phase-in [range](../r/range.md), thus qualifying for an increasing [credit](../c/credit.md) until the maximum EIC [value](../v/value.md) is reached.
2. If the family's [income](../i/income.md) were $30,000, they would fall in the phase-out [range](../r/range.md), reducing their EIC incrementally based on their [income](../i/income.md) level.

## Claiming the EIC

Taxpayers claim the EIC using Form 1040, Form 1040-SR, or Form 1040-NR. Essential components when claiming the EIC:

- **Schedule EIC**: Taxpayers with qualifying children must fill out Schedule EIC and provide the names and [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) Numbers of each qualifying child.
- **[Earned Income](../e/earned_income.md)**: Taxpayers must provide accurate information about their [earned income](../e/earned_income.md).

### Common Errors:

The IRS highlights common errors that can delay EIC claims or lead to denials:

- Incorrect [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) Numbers for [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) and qualifying children.
- Incorrect use of [filing status](../f/filing_status.md).
- Errors in reporting [earned income](../e/earned_income.md).

## Benefits of EIC

The primary advantages of the EIC are:

- **[Poverty](../p/poverty.md) Reduction**: It plays a crucial role in lifting millions of families out of [poverty](../p/poverty.md) by supplementing their [income](../i/income.md).
- **Incentivizing Work**: By providing financial benefits relative to [earned income](../e/earned_income.md), the EIC encourages employment.
- **Tax Burden Reduction**: It helps reduce the overall tax burden for low- to moderate-[income](../i/income.md) taxpayers.

## Criticisms and Challenges

Despite numerous benefits, the EIC faces criticisms and challenges:

- **Complexity**: The rules governing the EIC can be complex, leading to errors and misunderstandings.
- **[Fraud](../f/fraud.md) and Error Rates**: Due to its complexity, the EIC is prone to higher error rates and potential [fraud](../f/fraud.md).
- **Phase-Outs**: Some argue that the phase-out ranges can create disincentives for making additional [income](../i/income.md).

## Recent Changes and Updates

The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 made significant, but temporary, changes to the EIC for the tax year 2021:

- **Increase in Maximum [Credit](../c/credit.md)**: The maximum EIC for workers without children was significantly increased.
- **Broadening Age [Range](../r/range.md) for Eligibility**: The eligibility age [range](../r/range.md) for childless workers was expanded, now including workers as young as 19 and those over 65.
- **Temporary Changes**: These changes were applicable for the tax year 2021, but tax policy experts often debate whether such changes [will](../w/will.md) become permanent.

## Conclusion

The [Earned Income](../e/earned_income.md) [Credit](../c/credit.md) remains one of the most vital tools in the United States' tax code aimed at supporting low- to moderate-[income](../i/income.md) working families. Through its various mechanisms and targeted benefits, the EIC helps reduce [poverty](../p/poverty.md), incentivize employment, and alleviate the tax burden on millions of taxpayers annually. Despite its complexities and challenges, the positive impact of the EIC on American society underscores its continuing importance.

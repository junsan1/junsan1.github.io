## History
### Founding and Early Development
[Euronext](../e/euronext.md) Amsterdam traces its roots to the Amsterdam Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md), which was established by the Dutch East India Company (VOC). This innovation laid the foundational principles of modern [equity](../e/equity.md) markets. Companies could raise [capital](../c/capital.md) through the [sale](../s/sale.md) of [shares](../s/shares.md), and investors gained a new mechanism to invest in [business](../b/business.md) ventures.

### Evolution Over the Centuries
Throughout the centuries, the Amsterdam Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) evolved to adapt to changing [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md), technological advancements, and regulatory environments. Its [merger](../m/merger.md) with the Paris Bourse and the Brussels Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) to form [Euronext](../e/euronext.md) in 2000 marked a significant transformation. This collaboration was designed to create a seamless pan-European [market](../m/market.md) for securities trading.

### The Euronext Merger and Modernization
The establishment of [Euronext](../e/euronext.md), combining stock exchanges from [multiple](../m/multiple.md) countries, enhanced [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), and provided broader access to [capital markets](../c/capital_markets.md) for European companies.

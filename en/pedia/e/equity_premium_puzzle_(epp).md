# Equity Premium Puzzle (EPP)

The [Equity](../e/equity.md) [Premium](../p/premium.md) Puzzle (EPP) is one of the most enduring enigmas in [financial economics](../f/financial_economics.md). It relates to the observation that [historical returns](../h/historical_returns.md) on [stocks](../s/stock.md) have been significantly higher than returns on government bonds, more than what can be explained by classical economic theories. Specifically, the puzzle highlights that the large difference, or "[equity](../e/equity.md) [premium](../p/premium.md)," between the returns on equities and [risk](../r/risk.md)-free bonds cannot be easily justified by the standard consumption-based [asset pricing models](../a/asset_pricing_models.md).

## Historical Context

The term "[Equity](../e/equity.md) [Premium](../p/premium.md) Puzzle" was coined by economists Rajnish Mehra and Edward C. Prescott in their seminal 1985 paper "The [Equity](../e/equity.md) [Premium](../p/premium.md): A Puzzle". In this work, they demonstrated that the observed [equity](../e/equity.md) [premium](../p/premium.md) in U.S. [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) over the 20th century was far larger than what could be explained using standard models of [risk](../r/risk.md) aversion and intertemporal consumption choices.

## Key Components of the Puzzle

### Empirical Observation

The average [annual return](../a/annual_return.md) on U.S. [stocks](../s/stock.md) from 1889 to 1978 was approximately 7%, while the [return](../r/return.md) on treasury bonds was about 1%. This implies an [equity](../e/equity.md) [premium](../p/premium.md) of around 6%, which is incredibly high by historical standards. This disparity persists even when extending the analysis to global markets and different time periods.

### Classical Economic Theory

Standard economic theory posits that investors [demand](../d/demand.md) higher returns for holding riskier assets. However, the level of [risk](../r/risk.md) aversion required to justify a 6% [equity](../e/equity.md) [premium](../p/premium.md) is unrealistically high. Most consumption-based models [fail](../f/fail.md) to account for the magnitude of the [premium](../p/premium.md) without assuming that consumers are either excessively [risk-averse](../r/risk-averse.md) or that they behave in ways that deviate substantially from rational economic models.

## Theoretical Explanations

Researchers have proposed several explanations for the [Equity](../e/equity.md) [Premium](../p/premium.md) Puzzle, but none have been universally accepted. Some of the major explanations include:

### Consumption-Based Models

Classic models of [asset](../a/asset.md) pricing, such as the [Capital Asset](../c/capital_asset.md) Pricing Model (CAPM) and the Consumption [Capital Asset](../c/capital_asset.md) Pricing Model (CCAPM), have been widely used to explain [asset](../a/asset.md) returns. However, these models typically require implausibly high levels of [risk](../r/risk.md) aversion to account for the observed [equity](../e/equity.md) [premium](../p/premium.md).

### Behavioral Economics

Behavioral economists suggest that psychological factors and [cognitive biases](../c/cognitive_biases_in_trading.md) could explain the [equity](../e/equity.md) [premium](../p/premium.md). They argue that investors might overreact to short-term [market](../m/market.md) fluctuations, leading to an overestimation of [risk](../r/risk.md) and thus, demanding higher returns from equities.

### Market Frictions

[Market](../m/market.md) frictions such as [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md), [taxes](../t/taxes.md), and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) constraints may play a role in explaining the [equity](../e/equity.md) [premium](../p/premium.md). Real-world factors often cause deviations from idealized economic models, and these discrepancies could contribute to the higher observed returns on equities.

### Rare Disaster Risk

Another explanation involves the concept of rare but severe economic disasters. Under this theory, investors [demand](../d/demand.md) a high [premium](../p/premium.md) for holding equities to compensate for the small probability of catastrophic events that could lead to massive losses.

### Long-run Risks

Long-run risks pertaining to consumption growth could also account for the [equity](../e/equity.md) [premium](../p/premium.md). Bansal and Yaron (2004) proposed a model where long-term risks to consumption growth, combined with investorsâ€™ preferences for early resolution of [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md), could justify a large [equity](../e/equity.md) [premium](../p/premium.md).

## Quantitative Findings

### Mehra and Prescott (1985)

Mehra and Prescott's original analysis used a [utility](../u/utility.md) function with a coefficient of relative [risk](../r/risk.md) aversion and found that standard calibrations could only justify an [equity](../e/equity.md) [premium](../p/premium.md) of around 0.35%, far below the observed 6%. Their work indicated that traditional models were fundamentally flawed in explaining this [anomaly](../a/anomaly.md).

### Subsequent Research

Later research has sought to refine these models and incorporate additional factors. For instance, models incorporating habit formation (Campbell & Cochrane, 1999) have shown some promise in bridging the gap between theory and empirical observations.

### International Evidence

While the bulk of research has focused on U.S. data, the [equity](../e/equity.md) [premium](../p/premium.md) puzzle is a global phenomenon. Studies in different countries have generally found similar, albeit sometimes smaller, discrepancies between stock and [bond](../b/bond.md) returns, reinforcing the notion that the puzzle is not unique to the U.S.

### Time-Varying Risks

Some models propose that the risks and returns on equities are time-varying. The Conditional CAPM (C-CAPM) suggests that the [equity](../e/equity.md) [premium](../p/premium.md) varies with the state of the [economy](../e/economy.md) like [business cycle](../b/business_cycle.md) fluctuations, potentially resolving some of the puzzle.

## Practical Implications

### Portfolio Management

For portfolio managers and individual investors, the [equity](../e/equity.md) [premium](../p/premium.md) has tangible implications. The historically high [equity](../e/equity.md) [premium](../p/premium.md) suggests that [long-term investments](../l/long-term_investments.md) in [stocks](../s/stock.md) could [yield](../y/yield.md) superior returns compared to bonds. However, this also involves considerable [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Financial Planning

Financial advisors must consider the [equity](../e/equity.md) [premium](../p/premium.md) when crafting long-term investment strategies. The historical outperformance of equities suggests that younger investors might benefit from a higher allocation to [stocks](../s/stock.md), while older investors might prefer the stability of bonds.

### Policy Implications

Understanding the [equity](../e/equity.md) [premium](../p/premium.md) is crucial for policymakers, particularly in areas related to pension [fund](../f/fund.md) management and [retirement planning](../r/retirement_planning.md). Overestimating or underestimating future returns can have significant consequences for public and private pension systems.

### Risk Models

The [equity](../e/equity.md) [premium](../p/premium.md) puzzle challenges conventional [risk models](../r/risk_models_in_trading.md), prompting financial institutions to re-evaluate their [risk](../r/risk.md) assessment frameworks. Accurate models are essential for pricing assets, managing risks, and ensuring financial stability. 

## Criticisms and Alternative Views

Not all economists agree on the severity or implications of the [equity](../e/equity.md) [premium](../p/premium.md) puzzle. Some argue that the [anomaly](../a/anomaly.md) could be a result of data-snooping biases or statistical artifacts. Others believe that the puzzle is an artifact of the particular time period and data set analyzed by Mehra and Prescott, and may not [hold](../h/hold.md) under broader or alternative conditions.

## Conclusion

The [Equity](../e/equity.md) [Premium](../p/premium.md) Puzzle remains one of the most intriguing questions in [financial economics](../f/financial_economics.md). While various explanations have been proposed, none have definitively solved the puzzle, and it continues to challenge our understanding of [risk](../r/risk.md), [return](../r/return.md), and [investor](../i/investor.md) behavior. As [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) evolve and new data becomes available, it is possible that more satisfactory explanations [will](../w/will.md) emerge, potentially reshaping fundamental theories in investment and economic behavior.

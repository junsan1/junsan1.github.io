# Economic Indicators

Economic indicators are vital statistics about economic activities. They allow analysis of economic performance and predictions of future performance. These indicators provide statistical data regarding economic activities, business cycles, and macroeconomic trends. They include various metrics that reflect different aspects of the economy, including growth, employment, productivity, and inflation, amongst others.

### Leading Indicators

**1. Stock Market Returns**
Stock market returns are often considered a leading indicator because declines in stock prices suggest future economic downturns, while increases are associated with economic improvement. Investors react to economic data, company performance, and global events, making stock market performance a useful early gauge of economic direction.

**2. Manufacturing Activity**
The Purchasing Managersâ€™ Index (PMI) is a widely recognized indicator that captures manufacturing activity. An index above 50 denotes expansion, while below 50 indicates contraction. Manufacturing is a critical economic component, often linked closely to overall economic health.

**3. Building Permits**
Building permits data reflect future construction activity. A higher number of permits suggests growth in the housing market and, consequently, economic expansion. Conversely, a drop could indicate an economic slowdown.

**4. Consumer Confidence Index**
The Consumer Confidence Index (CCI) measures the level of consumer confidence in economic activities. High confidence suggests that consumers will spend more, boosting economic activities, while low confidence indicates reduced spending and potential economic slowdown.

### Coincident Indicators

**1. Gross Domestic Product (GDP)**
GDP is a comprehensive measure of economic activity within a country. It represents the total value of goods and services produced over a specific period and is a crucial sign of economic health. 

**2. Employment Levels**
Employment levels reflect the current state of the labor market. High employment rates usually correlate with a strong economy, while rising unemployment typically coincides with economic downturns.

**3. Personal Income**
Personal income is used to gauge the earning capacity of individuals, which can influence their spending habits. Stable or rising incomes suggest economic positivity, while declining incomes can signal economic problems.

### Lagging Indicators

**1. Unemployment Rate**
The unemployment rate is often considered a lagging indicator because it typically moves after the economy has already begun a trend of either improvement or decline. High unemployment rates usually persist even after economic recovery starts.

**2. Consumer Price Index (CPI)**
The CPI measures changes in the price level of a basket of consumer goods and services. It is used to assess inflation. Inflation often lags other economic trends but is crucial for assessing economic health.

**3. Business Inventories**
An increase in business inventories can indicate that products are not being sold as expected, suggesting an economic slowdown. Conversely, decreasing inventories can indicate rising sales and economic optimism.

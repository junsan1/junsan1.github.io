# Expected Utility

Expected [utility](../u/utility.md) is a fundamental concept in [economics](../e/economics.md), [finance](../f/finance.md), and [decision theory](../d/decision_theory.md), which provides a framework for making choices under [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md). It combines the [utility](../u/utility.md) (a measure of preference or satisfaction) that an individual derives from different outcomes with the probabilities of those outcomes. Through the lens of expected [utility](../u/utility.md), individuals and organizations can theoretically make decisions that maximize their overall satisfaction or [return](../r/return.md).

## Conceptual Foundation

### Utility

The notion of [utility](../u/utility.md) is central to understanding decision-making processes. [Utility](../u/utility.md) represents the satisfaction or benefit derived from a particular outcome. In [classical economics](../c/classical_economics.md), [utility](../u/utility.md) is often assumed to be quantifiable, allowing for the comparison of different outcomes. When facing choices under certainty, an individual simply selects the option with the highest [utility](../u/utility.md). However, in the real world, decisions are rarely made under conditions of absolute certainty.

### Probability

When outcomes are uncertain, probabilities come into play. Probabilities quantify the likelihood of various outcomes occurring and are essential in calculating expected [utility](../u/utility.md). They provide a way to measure and compare the [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with different choices.

### Expected Utility

Expected [utility theory](../u/utility_theory_in_trading.md) formalizes the decision-making process under [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md). The expected [utility](../u/utility.md) \( E(U) \) of a random variable \( X \), representing different outcomes with corresponding probabilities, is given by:

\[ E(U) = \sum_{i} P_i \cdot U(X_i) \]

Where:

- \( E(U) \) is the expected [utility](../u/utility.md).
- \( P_i \) is the probability of outcome \( X_i \).
- \( U(X_i) \) is the [utility](../u/utility.md) derived from outcome \( X_i \).

This framework allows for the evaluation of choices by considering both the [utility](../u/utility.md) of outcomes and their probabilities, leading to decisions that theoretically maximize overall satisfaction or [return](../r/return.md).

## Historical Context

The concept of [utility](../u/utility.md) dates back to early economic thought, but the formalization of expected [utility theory](../u/utility_theory_in_trading.md) is credited to John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern in their seminal work "Theory of Games and Economic Behavior" (1944). Their groundbreaking work laid the foundation for modern [decision theory](../d/decision_theory.md) and has influenced various fields, including [economics](../e/economics.md), [finance](../f/finance.md), and behavioral science.

## Application in Various Fields

### Economics

In [economics](../e/economics.md), expected [utility theory](../u/utility_theory_in_trading.md) is employed to model consumer behavior, investment choices, and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md). It helps in understanding how individuals allocate resources under [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md), and informs various models of [market](../m/market.md) behavior.

### Finance

In [finance](../f/finance.md), expected [utility](../u/utility.md) is crucial for portfolio selection, [risk](../r/risk.md) assessment, and [derivative](../d/derivative.md) pricing. The theory assists investors in making informed choices about which assets to include in their portfolios based on the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) and [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with each [asset](../a/asset.md).

### Behavioral Science

Expected [utility theory](../u/utility_theory_in_trading.md) also finds application in behavioral science to study how people make decisions under [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md). However, real-world observations have shown that individuals often deviate from the [rational behavior](../r/rational_behavior.md) predicted by the theory, leading to the development of alternative models such as [Prospect Theory](../p/prospect_theory.md).

## Key Points in Expected Utility Theory

### Risk Aversion

[Risk](../r/risk.md) aversion is a key concept in expected [utility theory](../u/utility_theory_in_trading.md). A [risk-averse](../r/risk-averse.md) individual prefers a certain outcome over a gamble with higher or equal expected [utility](../u/utility.md) due to the diminishing [marginal utility](../m/marginal_utility.md) of [wealth](../w/wealth.md). This behavior is captured by a concave [utility](../u/utility.md) function, indicating that the [marginal utility](../m/marginal_utility.md) of [wealth](../w/wealth.md) decreases as [wealth](../w/wealth.md) increases.

### Certainty Equivalent

The [certainty equivalent](../c/certainty_equivalent.md) of a gamble is the guaranteed amount of [money](../m/money.md) that an individual considers equally desirable as the gamble. It reflects the individual's [risk](../r/risk.md) preference and is used to evaluate their decision-making process under [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md).

### Stochastic Dominance

Stochastic dominance is a method for comparing [random variables](../r/random_variables.md) (or gambles) without specifying a particular [utility](../u/utility.md) function. If one gamble dominates another according to certain criteria, it [will](../w/will.md) be preferred by all decision-makers who share these criteria.

### Utility Functions

Different [utility functions](../u/utility_functions_in_trading.md) represent different attitudes toward [risk](../r/risk.md). Common forms include:

- **Linear [Utility](../u/utility.md) Function**: Represents [risk](../r/risk.md)-[neutral](../n/neutral.md) behavior.
- **Concave [Utility](../u/utility.md) Function**: Represents [risk-averse](../r/risk-averse.md) behavior.
- **Convex [Utility](../u/utility.md) Function**: Represents [risk](../r/risk.md)-seeking behavior.

The choice of [utility](../u/utility.md) function depends on the individual's [risk](../r/risk.md) preferences and the context of the decision-making problem.

## Criticisms and Limitations

Despite its widespread use, expected [utility theory](../u/utility_theory_in_trading.md) has faced criticisms and limitations:

### Violation of Rationality Assumptions

Real-world decision-makers often violate the rationality assumptions of expected [utility theory](../u/utility_theory_in_trading.md). Behavioral anomalies, such as [loss aversion](../l/loss_aversion.md) and preference reversals, have been documented, challenging the predictive power of the theory.

### Alternative Models

Given the limitations of expected [utility theory](../u/utility_theory_in_trading.md), alternative models have been proposed, including:

- **[Prospect Theory](../p/prospect_theory.md)**: Developed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, [Prospect Theory](../p/prospect_theory.md) incorporates psychological factors and provides a more accurate description of how people make decisions under [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md).
- **Cumulative [Prospect Theory](../p/prospect_theory.md)**: An extension of [Prospect Theory](../p/prospect_theory.md) that accounts for varying probabilities and provides a better fit for observed behaviors.

### Computational Complexity

Calculating expected [utility](../u/utility.md) can be computationally complex, especially for decisions with a large number of possible outcomes and probabilities. This complexity can limit the practical application of the theory in certain contexts.

## Quantitative Examples

To illustrate the calculation of expected [utility](../u/utility.md), consider the following examples:

### Example 1: Simple Lottery

An individual faces a lottery with two possible outcomes:

1. A payoff of $100 with a probability of 0.5.
2. A payoff of $0 with a probability of 0.5.

Assuming the individual's [utility](../u/utility.md) function is \( U(x) = \sqrt{x} \), the expected [utility](../u/utility.md) is calculated as follows:

\[ E(U) = 0.5 \cdot U(100) + 0.5 \cdot U(0) \]
\[ E(U) = 0.5 \cdot \sqrt{100} + 0.5 \cdot \sqrt{0} \]
\[ E(U) = 0.5 \cdot 10 + 0.5 \cdot 0 \]
\[ E(U) = 5 \]

### Example 2: Investment Decision

An [investor](../i/investor.md) is considering two investment [options](../o/options.md):

1. Investment A: A guaranteed [return](../r/return.md) of $10,000.
2. Investment B: A 50% chance of a $20,000 [return](../r/return.md) and a 50% chance of a $5,000 [return](../r/return.md).

Assuming the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s [utility](../u/utility.md) function is \( U(x) = \ln(x) \):

**Investment A:**
\[ U(10,000) = \ln(10,000) \approx 9.21 \]

**Investment B:**
\[ E(U) = 0.5 \cdot U(20,000) + 0.5 \cdot U(5,000) \]
\[ E(U) = 0.5 \cdot \ln(20,000) + 0.5 \cdot \ln(5,000) \]
\[ E(U) = 0.5 \cdot 9.90 + 0.5 \cdot 8.52 \]
\[ E(U) = 9.21 \]

The [investor](../i/investor.md) is indifferent between the two investments since the expected [utility](../u/utility.md) is the same.

## Practical Use Cases

### Insurance

[Insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies use expected [utility theory](../u/utility_theory_in_trading.md) to design and price [insurance](../i/insurance.md) products. By understanding the [risk](../r/risk.md) preferences of their clients, insurers can [offer](../o/offer.md) policies that maximize expected [utility](../u/utility.md) for both parties.

### Project Management

In [project management](../p/project_management.md), expected [utility theory](../u/utility_theory_in_trading.md) helps in evaluating the potential outcomes of different project strategies and choosing the one that maximizes overall project [value](../v/value.md).

### Policy Making

Policymakers use expected [utility theory](../u/utility_theory_in_trading.md) to assess the potential impact of different policy [options](../o/options.md) on societal [welfare](../w/welfare.md) and make decisions that maximize the expected [utility](../u/utility.md) of the population.

## Conclusion

Expected [utility theory](../u/utility_theory_in_trading.md) provides a [robust](../r/robust.md) framework for making decisions under [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) by combining the [utility](../u/utility.md) of outcomes with their probabilities. Despite its limitations and criticisms, the theory remains a cornerstone of decision-making processes in various fields, including [economics](../e/economics.md), [finance](../f/finance.md), and behavioral science. By understanding and applying expected [utility theory](../u/utility_theory_in_trading.md), decision-makers can make more informed and rational choices that maximize their overall satisfaction or [return](../r/return.md).

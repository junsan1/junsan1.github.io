# Enrolled Agent (EA): Overview, History, FAQ

Enrolled Agents (EAs) are federally-authorized tax practitioners who have technical expertise in the field of taxation and are empowered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to represent taxpayers before all levels of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for audits, collections, and appeals. The EA designation is the highest credential the IRS awards, and individuals who obtain this elite status must adhere to rigorous ethical standards and complete continuing education courses to maintain their status.

## Overview

### What is an Enrolled Agent?

An Enrolled Agent is a person who has earned the privilege of representing taxpayers before the Internal Revenue Service. EAs, like attorneys and certified public accountants (CPAs), have unlimited practice rights, meaning they are unrestricted with regard to which taxpayers they can represent, what types of tax matters they can handle, and which IRS offices they can practice before.

### How to Become an Enrolled Agent

To become an EA, candidates must either:

1. **Pass the Special Enrollment Examination (SEE):** This is a three-part comprehensive IRS test that covers individual and business tax returns. 
2. **Have relevant work experience:** Specifically, individuals who have worked at the IRS for at least five years in a position that requires the interpretation and application of the tax code are eligible for the EA credential without taking the SEE.

Once they meet one of these requirements, individuals must apply for enrollment and pass a background check. Enrolled Agents must also complete 72 hours of continuing education every three years, which includes six hours of ethics training.

### Responsibilities of Enrolled Agents

EAs provide various services related to tax preparation and tax representation. Their responsibilities include:

- **Tax Consultation and Preparation:** EAs prepare individual, business, and other entity tax returns. They offer tax planning services to help clients minimize their tax liabilities.
- **Tax Representation:** EAs represent clients in audits, collections, and appeals before the IRS. They can negotiate on behalf of taxpayers and help resolve any disputes.
- **Tax Advice:** They give professional advice on tax matters, ensuring that clients comply with current tax laws and regulations.

## History of Enrolled Agents

The EA profession dates back to 1884 when Congress enacted the Horse Act after questionable claims for losses incurred during the Civil War were rampant. The Act aimed to regulate agents who represented citizens in their claims against the government. Over the years, the role of EAs evolved and expanded considerably.

In 1959, Circular 230 was issued to regulate practice before the IRS, establishing various rules and guidelines for tax practitioners, including EAs. Further revisions to Circular 230 have been made to enhance the reliability and professionalism of practitioners and to protect taxpayers.

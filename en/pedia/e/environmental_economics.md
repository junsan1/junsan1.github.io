# Environmental Economics

Environmental [economics](../e/economics.md) is a branch of [economics](../e/economics.md) that deals with the economic impact of environmental policies. It involves a blend of traditional economic theories with environmental issues, aiming to balance [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) with environmental sustainability. Environmental economists study the interaction between economic activities and environmental quality. They develop and advocate for policies that aim to reduce environmental damage while supporting economic stability and growth.

## The Fundamentals of Environmental Economics

### Definition and Scope

Environmental [economics](../e/economics.md) is concerned with how economic activity interacts with the environment. Unlike traditional [economics](../e/economics.md), which often focuses purely on [profit](../p/profit.md) and loss, environmental [economics](../e/economics.md) evaluates the costs and benefits of environmental conservation and resource [depletion](../d/depletion.md). The main objective is to find optimal levels of pollution control and resource use.

### Objectives

Environmental [economics](../e/economics.md) aims to:

1. **Analyse Environmental Problems:**
   - Evaluate the economic causes and effects of environmental issues such as climate change, air and water pollution, and resource [depletion](../d/depletion.md).
   
2. **Develop and Advocate Policies:**
   - Propose solutions that reduce environmental harm while promoting sustainable [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md).
   
3. **Assign Economic Values to Environmental Goods:**
   - Place monetary values on non-[market](../m/market.md) goods and services provided by the environment, such as clean air and biodiversity.

### Theoretical Foundations

Environmental [economics](../e/economics.md) relies on several theoretical foundations, including:

1. **Externalities:**
   - Negative externalities occur when the production or consumption of goods and services imposes costs on third parties. For example, a factory emitting pollutants affects the health of nearby residents.
   
2. **Public Goods:**
   - Environmental goods like clean air and water are considered public goods because they are non-excludable and non-rivalrous – everyone can benefit from them, and one person's use does not reduce their availability to others.
   
3. **[Market Failure](../m/market_failure.md):**
   - When markets [fail](../f/fail.md) to provide an efficient allocation of resources, usually because the prices do not reflect the environmental costs (externalities). Environmental [economics](../e/economics.md) seeks to correct these [market](../m/market.md) failures.

4. **[Valuation](../v/valuation.md) of Non-[Market](../m/market.md) Goods:**
   - Methods such as contingent [valuation](../v/valuation.md) and [hedonic pricing](../h/hedonic_pricing.md) are used to estimate the [economic value](../e/economic_value.md) of non-[market](../m/market.md) environmental goods and services.

## Policy Instruments in Environmental Economics

### Command-and-Control Policies

These are regulatory policies where the government sets legal limits on pollution levels and mandates specific pollution-control technologies. Examples include:

1. **Emission Standards:**
   - Setting legal limits on the amount of pollutants that can be emitted by factories, vehicles, and other sources.
   
2. **Technology Standards:**
   - Requiring the use of specific pollution control technologies.

### Market-Based Instruments

[Market](../m/market.md)-based instruments use economic incentives to encourage businesses and individuals to reduce their environmental impact. Examples include:

1. **[Taxes](../t/taxes.md):**
   - Environmental [taxes](../t/taxes.md) (or "green [taxes](../t/taxes.md)") impose a cost on pollution, effectively internalizing the [externality](../e/externality.md). For example, carbon [taxes](../t/taxes.md) incentivize firms to reduce carbon emissions.
   
2. **Subsidies:**
   - Financial incentives provided to support environmentally friendly practices. For example, subsidies for renewable energy projects.
   
3. **Cap-and-[Trade](../t/trade.md) Systems:**
   - Set a maximum allowable level of pollution (cap) and distribute or auction emission permits. Companies can [trade](../t/trade.md) these permits, providing a financial incentive to reduce emissions.
   
#### Notable Cap-and-Trade Programs

- **[European Union](../e/european_union_(eu).md) Emissions Trading System (EU ETS):**
  - The world's first and largest international cap-and-[trade](../t/trade.md) program aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
  
- **California Cap-and-[Trade](../t/trade.md) Program:**
  - A state-level program in the United States designed to reduce GHG emissions from [industry](../i/industry.md), electricity, and natural gas sources.

### Voluntary Programs

Voluntary agreements between the government and private firms or industries to achieve environmental goals. These programs often include elements of public recognition and support.

## Valuation Techniques

### Contingent Valuation

A survey-based method used to estimate the [value](../v/value.md) of non-[market](../m/market.md) environmental goods. Respondents are asked how much they would be willing to pay for specific environmental benefits or to avoid certain environmental harms.

### Hedonic Pricing

A method used to estimate economic values for ecosystem or environmental services that directly affect [market](../m/market.md) prices, such as the impact of air pollution on property values.

### Travel Cost Method

Used to estimate economic use values associated with ecosystems or sites that are used for recreation. It calculates the [value](../v/value.md) of a site based on how much people are willing to pay to travel to it.

### Benefit Transfer

An approach where existing valuations from one study are used in a new study when conducting original [valuation](../v/valuation.md) is not feasible.

## Environmental Economics and Climate Change

Climate change is a major focus of environmental [economics](../e/economics.md). Economists study the costs and benefits of mitigation and adaptation strategies. Key areas include:

1. **Carbon Pricing:**
   - Implementing mechanisms like carbon [taxes](../t/taxes.md) and cap-and-[trade](../t/trade.md) systems to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
   
2. **Economic Impacts of Climate Change:**
   - Assessing how climate change affects economic activities and estimating the costs of adapting to these changes.
   
3. **[Cost-Benefit Analysis](../c/cost-benefit_analysis_in_trading.md) of Climate Policies:**
   - Comparing the costs of implementing climate policies with the benefits of reduced adverse impacts.

### Global Initiatives

- **Paris Agreement:**
  - An international treaty that aims to limit global temperature increase to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels.
  
- **Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC):**
  - Provides scientific assessments on climate change, its impacts, and potential future risks.

## Sustainability and Growth

Environmental [economics](../e/economics.md) emphasizes sustainable development, which meets present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It requires balancing economic, social, and environmental objectives.

### Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

Formulated by the United Nations, the SDGs provide a framework for achieving sustainable development by addressing issues such as [poverty](../p/poverty.md), inequality, and environmental degradation.

### Green Economy

A green [economy](../e/economy.md) aims to achieve sustainable development without degrading the environment. It focuses on reducing carbon emissions, improving resource [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md), and maintaining biodiversity.

## Case Studies

### The Stern Review

Commissioned by the UK government, the Stern Review on the [Economics](../e/economics.md) of Climate Change (2006) is a comprehensive report that discusses the economic impacts of climate change and the costs of action versus inaction. It concluded that the benefits of strong, early action on climate change outweigh the costs.

### Acid Rain Program (ARP), USA

The ARP is a successful cap-and-[trade](../t/trade.md) program aimed at reducing sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions, which are the primary causes of acid rain. The program led to significant reductions in emissions at lower-than-expected costs.

## Challenges in Environmental Economics

### Measuring Environmental Values

Assigning accurate economic values to environmental goods and services is complex and often controversial. Uncertainties in [valuation](../v/valuation.md) can lead to challenges in policy-making.

### Global Coordination

Achieving global cooperation on environmental issues like climate change is challenging due to differing national interests and economic circumstances.

### Balancing Economic and Environmental Goals

Finding the right balance between [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) and environmental protection is a major challenge. Policies need to be carefully designed to minimize negative economic impacts while maximizing environmental benefits.

## Conclusion

Environmental [economics](../e/economics.md) provides valuable tools and insights for addressing today’s pressing environmental challenges. By incorporating economic principles into environmental policy-making, it seeks to foster sustainable development that supports both economic and environmental well-being. As global environmental issues become increasingly complex, the role of environmental [economics](../e/economics.md) in shaping effective and equitable solutions [will](../w/will.md) only grow in importance.

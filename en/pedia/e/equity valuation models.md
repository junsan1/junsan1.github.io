# Equity Valuation Models

Equity valuation is the process of determining the fair market value of a company's equity, and it is a cornerstone of investment analysis and strategy. This valuation is essential for various stakeholders, including individual investors, institutional investors, and corporate managers. The goal of equity valuation is to derive the intrinsic value of a stock, which can then be compared to its current market price to identify investment opportunities.

Equity valuation models can be broadly classified into two categories: absolute valuation models and relative valuation models. Absolute valuation models are used to find the intrinsic value of an asset based on its fundamentals, such as dividends, earnings, and growth rates. Relative valuation models, on the other hand, estimate the value of an asset by comparing it to the valuation of other similar assets.

## Absolute Valuation Models

Absolute valuation models are grounded in the theory that the intrinsic value of a stock is derived from the fundamentals of the issuing company. The two most common absolute valuation methods are the Dividend Discount Model (DDM) and the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model.

### Dividend Discount Model (DDM)

The Dividend Discount Model (DDM) is based on the premise that the value of a stock is the present value of all future dividends. It assumes that dividends are the primary return for shareholders and forecasts these dividends over an extended period.

There are several variations of the DDM, including the Gordon Growth Model (GGM), which assumes a constant growth rate in dividends, and the Multi-stage DDM, which assumes that dividend growth rates will change over time.

#### Gordon Growth Model (GGM)

The Gordon Growth Model (GGM), named after Myron J. Gordon, is a simple and widely used version of DDM. It assumes that dividends will grow at a constant rate in perpetuity. The formula for GGM is:

\[ P_0 = \frac{D_0 (1 + g)}{r - g} \]

where:
- \( P_0 \) = Current stock price
- \( D_0 \) = Most recent dividend payment
- \( g \) = Growth rate of dividends
- \( r \) = Required rate of return

This model is best suited for companies with stable and predictable dividend growth rates.

#### Multi-stage Dividend Discount Model

The Multi-stage Dividend Discount Model accounts for different growth phases that a company might experience. It segments the future into multiple periods, each with a different growth rate. A common approach is the Two-stage DDM, which involves an initial high-growth period followed by a stable-growth period.

The valuation in a two-stage model can be represented as:

\[ P_0 = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \frac{D_t}{(1 + r)^t} + \frac{P_T}{(1 + r)^T} \]

where:
- \( D_t \) = Dividend at time \( t \)
- \( T \) = Terminal year, or the point at which growth stabilizes
- \( P_T \) = Terminal stock price, calculated by applying the GGM to dividends from year \( T \) onward
- \( r \) = Required rate of return
```

### Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model

The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model values a company based on the present value of its expected future cash flows. DCF analysis is a powerful tool because it incorporates all aspects of a company’s financial structure—revenues, expenses, taxes, and capital investments.

The DCF model typically involves the following steps:

1. **Estimation of Free Cash Flows** - Forecasting free cash flows (FCFs) for a certain period, usually 5-10 years.
2. **Determining the Terminal Value** - Calculating the value of the business beyond the forecast period, known as the terminal value.
3. **Discounting Cash Flows** - Discounting the FCFs and terminal value to the present value using a discount rate (typically the weighted average cost of capital or WACC).

The formula for the DCF model is:

\[ Value = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{FCF_t}{(1 + WACC)^t} + \frac{TV}{(1 + WACC)^n} \]

where:
- \( FCF_t \) = Free cash flow at time \( t \)
- \( WACC \) = Weighted average cost of capital
- \( TV \) = Terminal value
- \( n \) = Forecast period in years

#### Free Cash Flow (FCF)

Free Cash Flow represents the cash generated by the company after accounting for capital expenditures required to maintain or expand the asset base. It is a crucial metric because it indicates the amount of cash available to investors (both equity and debt holders). The formula is:

\[ FCF = EBIT \times (1 - Tax Rate) + Depreciation \& Amortization - Change in Working Capital - Capital Expenditures \]

#### Terminal Value (TV)

The Terminal Value captures the value of the company beyond the forecast period. There are several methods to calculate terminal value, but the two most common are the Perpetuity Growth Model and the Exit Multiple Method.

**Perpetuity Growth Model**:
\[ TV = \frac{FCF_{n+1}}{WACC - g} \]

where:
- \( FCF_{n+1} \) = Free cash flow in the first year beyond the forecast period
- \( WACC \) = Weighted average cost of capital
- \( g \) = Growth rate in perpetuity

**Exit Multiple Method**:
This method involves applying a multiple to a financial metric (like EBITDA) at the end of the forecast period.
\[ TV = EBITDA_n \times Exit \, Multiple \]

where:
- \( EBITDA_n \) = EBITDA in the final year of the forecast period
- \( Exit \, Multiple \) = Multiple based on comparable company analysis

## Relative Valuation Models

Relative valuation models, also known as multiples-based valuation methods, compare the company's valuation with those of peer companies in the same industry. Common multiples include Price-to-Earnings (P/E), Price-to-Book (P/B), and Enterprise Value-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA).

### Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio

The P/E ratio compares a company's current share price to its per-share earnings, providing insight into how the market values a company's earnings.

\[ P/E \, Ratio = \frac{Market \, Value \, per \, Share}{Earnings \, per \, Share (EPS)} \]

A high P/E ratio may indicate that the stock is overvalued, or investors expect high growth rates in the future. Conversely, a low P/E ratio might imply undervaluation or expectations of slower growth.

### Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio

The P/B ratio compares a company's market value to its book value, offering a sense of whether the stock is valued appropriately relative to its assets.

\[ P/B \, Ratio = \frac{Market \, Value \, per \, Share}{Book \, Value \, per \, Share} \]

A P/B ratio greater than 1 suggests that the company is valued more than its book value, which could be due to market perception of its growth potential or intangible assets.

### Enterprise Value-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) Ratio

The EV/EBITDA ratio examines a company's valuation by comparing its enterprise value (EV) to its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), providing a more comprehensive valuation by including debt and cash.

\[ EV/EBITDA = \frac{Enterprise \, Value}{EBITDA} \]

The formula for Enterprise Value is:
\[ Enterprise \, Value = Market \, Cap + Total \, Debt - Cash \]

A low EV/EBITDA ratio may suggest that the company is undervalued, while a high ratio can indicate overvaluation.

## Advanced Valuation Techniques

While the basic absolute and relative models are used widely due to their simplicity and clarity, advanced techniques incorporate more complex aspects of business operations and market conditions. Some of these advanced methods include:

### Economic Value Added (EVA)

Economic Value Added (EVA) is a measure of a company's financial performance based on residual wealth, calculated by deducting the cost of capital from the company's operating profit.

\[ EVA = NOPAT - (Capital \times WACC) \]

where:
- \( NOPAT \) = Net operating profit after taxes
- \( Capital \) = Total capital invested in the company
- \( WACC \) = Weighted average cost of capital

EVA helps in assessing whether a company generates value over and above its cost of capital, which is useful for evaluating managerial performance and investment decisions.

### Real Options Valuation

Real options provide a framework for valuing investment opportunities that accounts for the flexibility managers have in making investment decisions in response to unexpected market developments. This approach treats investment opportunities as "options" that can be exercised or deferred in the future.

Valuing real options typically involves using financial option pricing models like the Black-Scholes model or binomial models.

### Residual Income Model

The Residual Income Model (RIM) values a company based on the income generated above a required rate of return. Unlike DCF, RIM focuses on the excess returns a company generates, making it particularly useful for companies that do not pay dividends.

\[ Value = Book \, Value + \sum_{t=1}^n \frac{Residual \, Income \, t}{(1 + r)^t} \]

where:
- Residual Income = Net Income - (Equity Capital \times Cost of Equity)
- \( r \) = Cost of Equity

### Sum-of-the-Parts (SOTP) Valuation

Sum-of-the-Parts (SOTP) valuation involves valuing each business unit or segment of a diversified company separately and then summing these values to arrive at the total enterprise value. This method is particularly useful for conglomerates with multiple unrelated business segments.

## Conclusion

Equity valuation is a multifaceted field necessitating a deep understanding of finance, accounting, and market dynamics. Whether using absolute models like DDM and DCF, relative models like P/E and EV/EBITDA, or advanced techniques like EVA and real options valuation, the goal remains to determine the intrinsic value of a stock to make informed investment decisions.

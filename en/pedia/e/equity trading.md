## Equity Trading

Equity Trading refers to the buying and selling of company shares or stocks in financial markets. Shares represent ownership in a company, and trading them involves transferring that ownership among investors. Equity trading can be conducted on various exchanges as well as over the counter (OTC). This process plays a crucial role in the global financial system, providing liquidity and enabling the efficient allocation of resources.

### Types of Equity Markets

1. **Primary Market**
   - **Initial Public Offerings (IPOs)**: Companies raise capital by issuing new shares to the public. The primary market involves the initial sale of these new shares.
   - **Follow-On Public Offers (FPOs)**: Public companies can issue additional shares to raise more capital.

2. **Secondary Market**
   - **Stock Exchanges**: Platforms where previously issued shares are traded among investors. Major stock exchanges include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Nasdaq.
   - **Over-the-Counter (OTC) Markets**: Decentralized markets where trading occurs directly between parties, typically via brokers.

   - **Quantitative Trading**: Employing mathematical models and extensive data analysis to make trading decisions.

### Equity Derivatives

- **Options**: Contracts giving the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell stock at a specified price within a certain timeframe.
- **Futures**: Agreements to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined future date and price.

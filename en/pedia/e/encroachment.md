# Encroachment

## Definition
**Encroachment** refers to the intrusion of a structure, object, or activity into a space or area that it does not legally or rightfully belong to. In the context of [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), encroachment specifically refers to a situation where a property owner violates the [property rights](../p/property_rights.md) of a neighbor by building or extending a structure beyond their legal property boundaries.

## Key Components
1. **Intrusion**: Unauthorized extension of a structure or object into someone else's property.
2. **Property Boundaries**: The legally defined limits of a property that determine ownership and usage rights.
3. **Violation**: Encroachment constitutes a violation of [property rights](../p/property_rights.md), often leading to disputes or legal action.

## Types of Encroachment
1. **Structural Encroachment**: Physical structures such as buildings, fences, driveways, or sheds that extend beyond property lines.
   - **Example**: A homeowner builds a garage that partially sits on the neighbor’s land.
2. **Natural Encroachment**: Natural elements like tree roots or branches that grow beyond property boundaries.
   - **Example**: Tree branches from one property hanging over and affecting the neighbor’s yard.
3. **Usage Encroachment**: Activities or uses of land that infringe upon a neighbor's [property rights](../p/property_rights.md).
   - **Example**: Using a portion of a neighbor’s land as a garden or parking area without permission.

## Importance
1. **[Property Rights](../p/property_rights.md)**: Encroachment affects [property rights](../p/property_rights.md), which are fundamental to property ownership and use.
2. **Legal Disputes**: Encroachment can lead to disputes between neighbors, potentially resulting in legal action and court cases.
3. **Property [Value](../v/value.md)**: Encroachment can impact property values and make it difficult to sell or develop property.

## Legal Implications
1. **Resolution**: Encroachment issues can be resolved through mutual agreements, legal action, or by removing the encroaching structure.
2. **[Adverse Possession](../a/adverse_possession.md)**: In some cases, long-term encroachment can lead to claims of [adverse possession](../a/adverse_possession.md), where the encroaching party may [gain](../g/gain.md) legal ownership of the disputed land.
3. **Easements**: Legal arrangements, known as easements, can be made to allow the encroaching use while clarifying [property rights](../p/property_rights.md).

## Example Scenarios
1. **Residential Encroachment**: A homeowner builds a deck that extends several feet onto the neighbor’s property. The neighbor notices the encroachment and brings it to the homeowner’s attention, leading to a dispute.
2. **Commercial Encroachment**: A [business](../b/business.md) installs a sign that partially extends over the boundary into an adjacent property. The affected property owner demands the removal of the sign.
3. **Natural Encroachment**: Roots from a large tree on one property extend into the neighboring property, causing damage to the foundation of the neighbor’s house. The neighbor seeks compensation for the damage.

## Addressing Encroachment
1. **Survey and Documentation**: Conduct a property survey to determine exact boundaries and document the encroachment.
2. **[Negotiation](../n/negotiation.md)**: Attempt to resolve the [issue](../i/issue.md) amicably through direct [negotiation](../n/negotiation.md) with the encroaching party.
3. **Legal Action**: If [negotiation](../n/negotiation.md) fails, consider seeking legal advice and potentially taking the matter to court to resolve the dispute.
4. **Removal or Modification**: Remove or modify the encroaching structure to comply with legal property boundaries.

## Conclusion
Encroachment is a significant [issue](../i/issue.md) in [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) that involves the unauthorized intrusion of a structure, object, or activity onto another person's property. It can lead to disputes, legal challenges, and affect property values. Addressing encroachment requires understanding property boundaries, documenting the [issue](../i/issue.md), and seeking resolution through [negotiation](../n/negotiation.md) or legal action if necessary.

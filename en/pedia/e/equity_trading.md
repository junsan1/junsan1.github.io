# Equity Trading

Equity Trading refers to the buying and selling of company shares or stocks in financial markets. Shares represent ownership in a company, and trading them involves transferring that ownership among investors. Equity trading can be conducted on various exchanges as well as over the counter (OTC). This process plays a crucial role in the global financial system, providing liquidity and enabling the efficient allocation of resources.

### Types of Equity Markets

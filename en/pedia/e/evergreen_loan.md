# Evergreen Loan

An evergreen [loan](../l/loan.md) is a type of [loan](../l/loan.md) arrangement with no fixed [maturity date](../m/maturity_date.md), allowing borrowers continuous access to funding. Essentially, itâ€™s a [revolving credit](../r/revolving_credit.md) [facility](../f/facility.md) where the [principal](../p/principal.md) balance doesn't decline unless the borrower makes payments exceeding the [interest](../i/interest.md) charged. Such financial products are common in [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md) and are often utilized by businesses needing ongoing access to funds for operating expenses, [capital](../c/capital.md) expenditures, or investment opportunities. By ensuring [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), evergreen loans can help companies maintain stability and foster growth, despite the cyclical nature of their cash flows.

## Characteristics of Evergreen Loans

Evergreen loans possess a few distinctive features that differentiate them from traditional term loans:

1. **No Fixed [Maturity Date](../m/maturity_date.md)**: Unlike conventional loans with scheduled [repayment](../r/repayment.md) deadlines, evergreen loans are indefinite. The borrower can continue to draw down, repay, and re-borrow funds as long as they comply with the terms and conditions set by the [lender](../l/lender.md).
2. **Revolving Nature**: These loans function similarly to a [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) in that the borrower has access to a set [credit limit](../c/credit_limit.md) and can draw on these funds as needed.
3. **[Interest](../i/interest.md)-Only Payments**: Typically, borrowers are required to make [interest](../i/interest.md)-only payments on the outstanding balance. [Principal](../p/principal.md) [repayment](../r/repayment.md) is flexible and can be managed according to the available [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md).
4. **Periodic Reviews**: Lenders periodically review the borrower's [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) and [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) to decide whether to extend, reduce, or recall the [credit facility](../c/credit_facility.md).
5. **[Collateral](../c/collateral.md) and Covenants**: Evergreen loans can be secured or unsecured. For secured loans, assets such as [inventory](../i/inventory.md), receivables, or [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) may be pledged. Additionally, the borrower must comply with certain financial covenants imposed by the [lender](../l/lender.md).

## Applications of Evergreen Loans

Evergreen loans are versatile and can be used in various scenarios, particularly benefiting companies needing sustained access to funds. Key applications include:

1. **[Working Capital Management](../w/working_capital_management.md)**: Businesses facing seasonal fluctuations or uneven cash flows can use evergreen loans to manage day-to-day expenses, [payroll](../p/payroll.md), [inventory](../i/inventory.md) purchases, and other operational costs without facing [repayment](../r/repayment.md) pressure.
2. **[Capital](../c/capital.md) Expenditures**: Companies undertaking [capital](../c/capital.md)-intensive projects invest in equipment, technology, or [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) using evergreen loans. The flexible [repayment](../r/repayment.md) terms align well with the often unpredictable returns of such investments.
3. **Strategic Investments**: Firms seeking [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) opportunities, research and development, or [market](../m/market.md) expansions can [leverage](../l/leverage.md) evergreen loans to [finance](../f/finance.md) these strategic initiatives.
4. **[Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md) Bridging**: During delays in payments from customers or other receivables, firms can use evergreen loans as a temporary solution to cover shortfalls and maintain smooth operations.

## Advantages of Evergreen Loans

Evergreen loans [offer](../o/offer.md) several benefits for both borrowers and lenders, making them a popular choice in various financial settings:

1. **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) [Assurance](../a/assurance.md)**: They provide continuous access to funds, thereby ensuring [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and financial stability for businesses.
2. **Flexibility**: The revolving nature and [interest](../i/interest.md)-only [repayment](../r/repayment.md) terms [offer](../o/offer.md) flexibility in managing cash flows.
3. **Reduced [Refinance](../r/refinance.md) [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: No fixed [maturity date](../m/maturity_date.md) reduces the [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with refinancing and potential [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) crunches.
4. **Customizable Terms**: Borrowers can negotiate terms such as [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, [credit](../c/credit.md) limits, and covenants tailored to their specific needs.

## Risks and Challenges of Evergreen Loans

Despite their advantages, evergreen loans come with their fair share of risks and challenges:

1. **[Credit Risk](../c/credit_risk.md)**: Continuous borrowing without substantial [principal](../p/principal.md) [repayment](../r/repayment.md) can lead to increased [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) for lenders, especially if borrowers face [financial distress](../f/financial_distress.md).
2. **Overleveraging**: Easy access to funds can lead to overleveraging, where businesses accumulate excessive [debt](../d/debt.md), potentially jeopardizing their [financial health](../f/financial_health.md).
3. **[Lender](../l/lender.md)'s Discretion**: Periodic reviews by lenders create [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) for borrowers regarding the availability of funds. Lenders might reduce or withdraw the [credit facility](../c/credit_facility.md) based on [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md).
4. **[Interest Rate Risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md)**: Variable [interest](../i/interest.md) rates can result in significant cost variations, posing a challenge for [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md) and [forecasting](../f/forecasting.md).

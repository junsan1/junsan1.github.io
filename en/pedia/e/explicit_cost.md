# Explicit Cost

Explicit costs, also known as [accounting](../a/accounting.md) costs or out-of-pocket costs, are direct, outlay expenditures, with clear and unmistakable physical [receipts](../r/receipt.md) or recordable transactions. These costs consist of direct payments made to others in the course of running a [business](../b/business.md), such as salaries, rent, utilities, [raw materials](../r/raw_materials.md), and other day-to-day operational expenses. In essence, explicit costs are outflows of cash that can be directly traced and recorded in the financial books of a company. They play a critical role in determining a company's profitability and [financial health](../f/financial_health.md).

## Key Features of Explicit Costs

### Identifiable and Quantifiable

Explicit costs are easily identifiable and quantifiable because they involve direct cash outflows that can be traced to specific transactions. Whether it is paying a [utility](../u/utility.md) bill or purchasing [raw materials](../r/raw_materials.md), these costs have a definitive monetary [value](../v/value.md) and corresponding evidence such as [receipts](../r/receipt.md) or invoices.

### Recorded in Financial Statements

These costs are recorded in the [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) of a company, primarily appearing in the [income statement](../i/income_statement.md) and the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md). Explicit costs are crucial for calculating key financial metrics, such as [gross profit](../g/gross_profit.md), [operating profit](../o/operating_profit.md), and net [income](../i/income.md). They also provide a clear picture of the company's [expense](../e/expense.md) structure and cash outflows.

### Examples of Explicit Costs

1. **Salaries and Wages**  
	Payments made to employees, including wages, salaries, bonuses, and other compensations.
	
2. **Rent and Leasing Costs**  
	Payments made for renting office space, [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) plants, or any other property necessary for the [business](../b/business.md).
	
3. **Utilities**  
	Expenses related to electricity, water, internet, and other utilities required for the [business](../b/business.md) operations.
	
4. **[Raw Materials](../r/raw_materials.md)**  
	Cost of acquiring [raw materials](../r/raw_materials.md), components, and parts essential for [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) the company's products.
	
5. **[Marketing](../m/marketing.md) and Advertising**  
	Expenditures on promoting the company's products and services, including online and offline advertising campaigns.
	
6. **Professional Fees**  
	Payments made for professional services such as consulting, legal fees, and [accounting](../a/accounting.md) services.
	
7. **Maintenance and Repairs**  
	Costs associated with maintaining and repairing equipment, facilities, and other assets.

### Importance of Explicit Costs

Understanding explicit costs is vital for several reasons:

1. **[Profit](../p/profit.md) Calculation**  
	Explicit costs are subtracted from total revenues to calculate a [firm](../f/firm.md)'s [profit](../p/profit.md). This fundamental equation provides a clear understanding of the company’s profitability. 

2. **[Financial Planning](../f/financial_planning.md) and Budgeting**  
	By identifying explicit costs, companies can create more accurate financial plans and budgets. These help in [forecasting](../f/forecasting.md) future expenses and making informed financial decisions.
	
3. **[Cost Control](../c/cost_control.md) and Reduction**  
	Tracking explicit costs helps in identifying areas where the company can cut down expenses and improve [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md). This can lead to better [cost control](../c/cost_control.md) and enhanced profitability.
	
4. **Performance Evaluation**  
	Explicit costs are essential metrics in evaluating the [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) of a [business](../b/business.md). Investors and stakeholders often analyze these costs to assess the company’s [operational efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md) and profitability.

### Explicit Costs in AlgorTrading

Explicit costs play a significant role in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) (algo trading) as well. Companies engaging in high-frequency trading or other forms of algo trading incur various explicit costs that must be accurately accounted for to assess profitability and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md).

1. **[Infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) Costs**  
	Maintaining a [robust](../r/robust.md) technical [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) is crucial for algo trading. This includes hardware costs, data center fees, and software licenses. Companies may also pay for high-speed internet connections and specialized trading platforms.
	
2. **Data Feeds and [Market](../m/market.md) Access**  
	Algo trading relies on real-time data feeds from various [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). Subscriptions to these data feeds and the cost of accessing [market](../m/market.md) exchanges contribute to explicit costs.
	
3. **[Transaction Costs](../t/transaction_costs.md)**  
	Every [trade](../t/trade.md) executed incurs [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md) such as brokerage fees, [exchange](../e/exchange.md) fees, and regulatory fees. Even in high-frequency trading, where the [profit](../p/profit.md) per [trade](../t/trade.md) may be small, these [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md) can accumulate significantly.
	
4. **Programming and Development**  
	Payments made to developers and data scientists for creating and maintaining [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) fall under explicit costs. These may include not just salaries but also any [outsourcing](../o/outsourcing.md) fees paid to external experts.
	
5. **Compliance and Legal Fees**  
	Algo trading operations must adhere to various regulatory standards, which often necessitate legal consultations and compliance audits, leading to additional explicit costs.

### Example of an Algo Trading Firm - Jane Street

Jane Street is an example of a global [proprietary trading](../p/proprietary_trading.md) [firm](../f/firm.md) that engages heavily in algo trading. Known for its rigorous [quantitative research](../q/quantitative_research.md) and sophisticated [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), the [firm](../f/firm.md) deals with various explicit costs associated with its operations.

### Conclusion

Explicit costs are foundational elements in the [financial accounting](../f/financial_accounting.md) of any [business](../b/business.md), including those engaged in algo trading. They provide clear, identifiable records of cash outflows, crucial for [profit](../p/profit.md) calculation, [budget](../b/budget.md) planning, [cost control](../c/cost_control.md), and performance evaluation. Understanding and managing these costs effectively can significantly influence the overall [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and [operational efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md) of a [business](../b/business.md).

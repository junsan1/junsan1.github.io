# Ethereum Classic (ETC)

[Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) Classic (ETC) is an [open](../o/open.md)-source, decentralized [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md)-based distributed cryptocurrency platform that runs [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md). It is the original [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md), which resulted from a hard fork of the [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) network in July 2016. [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) Classic allows for the deployment of decentralized applications (DApps) and [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md), which are self-executing contracts where the terms of the agreement or conditions are directly written into lines of code. The [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) Classic [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) maintains the original history of the [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) chain, including all transactions, [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md), and blocks, up until the point of the hard fork, and then continues independently from [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md).

## History of Ethereum Classic

### The Ethereum Hard Fork

The inception of [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) Classic is deeply tied to a controversial event in the history of [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) â€“ The DAO hack, which occurred in June 2016. The Decentralized Autonomous Organization (The DAO) was a [venture capital](../v/venture_capital.md) [fund](../f/fund.md) built on [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) that aimed to democratize the investment process through a decentralized structure. However, a vulnerability in The DAO's code was exploited, resulting in the theft of approximately $50 million worth of Ether.

To mitigate the damage and restore the funds to the original investors, the [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) community proposed a hard fork, which would effectively reverse the hack by rewriting the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md)'s history. This decision was polarizing, leading to a split within the community. Those who supported the hard fork moved ahead with the new chain, which retained the [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) name (ETH), while those who opposed it continued with the original chain, rebranding it as [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) Classic (ETC).

### Philosophical Differences

The fundamental [divergence](../d/divergence.md) between [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) (ETH) and [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) Classic (ETC) lies in their stance on immutability. [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) Classic staunchly upholds the immutability principle, meaning that once transactions are added to the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md), they cannot be altered or erased. This is rooted in the belief that [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md)'s core [value proposition](../v/value_proposition.md) is its ability to provide an unchangeable record.

On the other hand, the [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) (ETH) community prioritized the practical necessity of addressing the hack, viewing the fork as a necessary measure to protect users and secure the network. This philosophical difference informs much of the ongoing development and community governance practices of both networks.

## Key Features of Ethereum Classic

### Smart Contracts

[Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) Classic, like [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md), enables the creation and [execution](../e/execution.md) of [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md). These are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They allow for the automation of complex transactions and applications without the need for intermediaries. [Smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md) on [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) Classic can [handle](../h/handle.md) a vast array of decentralized applications (DApps) ranging from [finance](../f/finance.md) to [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md) management and beyond.

### Decentralized Applications (DApps)

DApps on [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) Classic operate on a decentralized network of peers rather than on a centralized server. These applications benefit from the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md)'s [security](../s/security.md) and [transparency](../t/transparency.md). Developers can create DApps for various use cases, leveraging the decentralized nature of the [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) Classic [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) to build resilient, trustless systems.

### Proof of Work (PoW)

[Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) Classic uses a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism. In PoW, miners compete to solve complex cryptographic puzzles to add new blocks to the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md). This process secures the network and ensures consensus across all nodes. PoW is energy-intensive, but it has been integral in maintaining the [security](../s/security.md) and integrity of the [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) Classic [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md).

### Fixed Monetary Policy

[Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) Classic distinguishes itself with a fixed [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md). While [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) (ETH) has plans to transition to a Proof of Stake (PoS) system and introduce various changes to its [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md), including altering its issuance rate and schedule, [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) Classic has decided on a fixed [supply](../s/supply.md) cap of 210 million ETC. This policy is designed to provide predictability and to establish ETC as a [store of value](../s/store_of_value.md) akin to [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md).

## Development and Governance

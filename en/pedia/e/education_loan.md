# Education Loan

An education [loan](../l/loan.md) is a sum of [money](../m/money.md) borrowed to [finance](../f/finance.md) post-secondary education or higher education-related expenses. These loans are designed to help students pay for university tuition, books, and living expenses. It’s different from other types of loans in that the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) may be substantially lower and the [repayment](../r/repayment.md) schedule may be deferred while the student is still in education. 

## Purpose of Education Loans

Education loans serve the purpose of making higher education accessible to students who might not be able to afford it otherwise. As the cost of tuition and other academic expenses has risen significantly over the years, many students and their families require financial assistance to cover these costs. Education loans can bridge the financial gap, allowing students to pursue their academic and career goals.

## Types of Education Loans

### Federal Student Loans (U.S.)

Federal student loans are provided by the government and often [offer](../o/offer.md) more favorable terms and conditions compared to private loans. They usually have fixed [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and may [offer](../o/offer.md) [income](../i/income.md)-driven [repayment](../r/repayment.md) plans. In the United States, there are several types of federal student loans:

1. **Direct Subsidized Loans**: Available to undergraduate students with demonstrated financial need. The U.S. Department of Education pays the [interest](../i/interest.md) on these loans while the student is in school at least half-time.

2. **Direct Unsubsidized Loans**: Available to both undergraduate and graduate students; no proof of financial need is required. [Interest](../i/interest.md) accrues from the time the [loan](../l/loan.md) is disbursed.

3. **Direct PLUS Loans**: Available to graduate students and parents of dependent undergraduate students to help pay for education expenses not covered by other financial aid.

4. **Direct [Consolidation](../c/consolidation.md) Loans**: Allows students to combine [multiple](../m/multiple.md) federal student loans into one [loan](../l/loan.md) with a single [loan](../l/loan.md) servicer.

### Private Student Loans

Private student loans are provided by banks, [credit](../c/credit.md) unions, and other financial institutions. These loans often have variable [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, and the terms and conditions can vary widely. Examples include loans from entities such as Sallie Mae and Discover Student Loans. In many cases, repayments may start immediately, and the [interest](../i/interest.md) rates might be higher depending on the borrower’s [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md).

### State-Sponsored Loans

Some states [offer](../o/offer.md) education loans to residents or students attending local universities. These loans often have favorable terms similar to federal loans but may come with specific residency or school requirements.

## Application Process

Applying for an education [loan](../l/loan.md) generally involves the following steps:

### Federal Loans

1. **Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)**: Students must fill out the FAFSA form to determine eligibility for federal loans, grants, and work-study programs.
   
2. **Award Letter**: Based on the FAFSA, the college or university [will](../w/will.md) send an award letter detailing the types and amounts of aid the student is eligible to receive.

3. **Master [Promissory Note](../p/promissory_note.md) (MPN)**: The student must sign an MPN agreeing to the terms of the [loan](../l/loan.md).

### Private Loans

1. **Comparing Lenders**: Students and their families should compare various private lenders for [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, terms, and conditions.

2. **Application**: Once a [lender](../l/lender.md) is chosen, the student [will](../w/will.md) need to complete an application, which [will](../w/will.md) often require a [credit](../c/credit.md) [check](../c/check.md).

3. **Approval and [Disbursement](../d/disbursement.md)**: If approved, the [lender](../l/lender.md) [will](../w/will.md) disburse the [loan](../l/loan.md) funds directly to the educational institution.

## Interest Rates and Repayment

### Interest Rates

[Interest](../i/interest.md) rates on education loans can either be fixed or variable. 
* **Fixed rates**: The [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) remains the same throughout the life of the [loan](../l/loan.md).
* **Variable rates**: The [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) can change over time based on [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

Generally, federal loans have lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates compared to private loans. Some loans, such as the Direct Subsidized [Loan](../l/loan.md), may have the benefit of the government paying the [interest](../i/interest.md) while the student is in school.

### Repayment Options

[Repayment](../r/repayment.md) can be handled through various plans, especially for federal student loans. Common federal [repayment](../r/repayment.md) plans include:

1. **Standard [Repayment](../r/repayment.md) Plan**: Fixed monthly payments over a 10-year period.
   
2. **Graduated [Repayment](../r/repayment.md) Plan**: Payments start low and gradually increase, typically every two years.
   
3. **[Income](../i/income.md)-Driven [Repayment](../r/repayment.md) Plans**: Monthly payments are calculated based on [income](../i/income.md) and family size, and can [range](../r/range.md) from 10% to 20% of [discretionary income](../d/discretionary_income.md). Examples include [Income](../i/income.md)-Based [Repayment](../r/repayment.md) (IBR), Pay As You Earn (PAYE), and Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE).

4. **Extended [Repayment](../r/repayment.md) Plan**: [Loan](../l/loan.md) terms can be stretched up to 25 years, reducing monthly payments but increasing the total [interest](../i/interest.md) paid.

For private loans, [repayment](../r/repayment.md) terms can vary widely by [lender](../l/lender.md). Some might allow deferral while the student is in school, while others might require payments immediately.

## Benefits and Drawbacks

2. **Flexible [Repayment](../r/repayment.md) [Options](../o/options.md)**: Various plans cater to different financial situations.

3. **Building [Credit](../c/credit.md)**: Timely payments can help in building a strong [credit](../c/credit.md) history.

## Loan Forgiveness Programs

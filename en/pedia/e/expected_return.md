# Expected Return

In the realm of quantitative finance, specifically algorithmic trading (or "algo trading"), the concept of Expected Return is fundamental. Expected Return refers to the mean of the probability distribution of possible returns of an asset, investment, or portfolio. It is a critical metric in evaluating the potential profitability of trades and investments in both traditional and algorithmic trading.

## What is Expected Return?

Expected Return (\(E(R)\)) represents the weighted average of all possible returns from an investment, where the weights correspond to the probabilities of each outcome occurring. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

\[ E(R) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} P_i \cdot R_i \]

where:
- \(E(R)\) is the Expected Return,
- \(P_i\) is the probability of the \(i\)-th return,
- \(R_i\) is the \(i\)-th potential return,
- \(n\) is the number of potential returns.

## Importance of Expected Return in Algo Trading

### Risk Assessment and Management

Expected Return is a crucial factor in quantifying the risk associated with different trading strategies. By understanding the potential for gains and losses, traders can adjust their algorithms to optimize performance and minimize risk. Coupled with other metrics such as variance and standard deviation, Expected Return helps in the calculation of risk-adjusted returns, which is essential for making informed investment decisions.

### Portfolio Optimization

In algorithmic trading, portfolio optimization aims to create a combination of assets that maximizes the Expected Return for a given level of risk. This is often achieved using statistical techniques such as Mean-Variance Optimization, where Expected Return plays a significant role in determining the efficient frontierâ€”the set of optimal portfolios that provide the highest Expected Return for a defined level of risk.

### Performance Metrics

Many performance metrics in algo trading, such as the Sharpe Ratio, rely on Expected Return. The Sharpe Ratio, which measures the performance of an investment compared to a risk-free asset after adjusting for risk, is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{E(R) - R_f}{\sigma} \]

where:
- \(E(R)\) is the Expected Return,
- \(R_f\) is the risk-free rate of return,
- \(\sigma\) is the standard deviation of the return.

A higher Sharpe Ratio indicates a more attractive risk-adjusted return, thereby reinforcing the importance of accurately calculating Expected Return.

## Calculating Expected Return

### Historical Mean Return

One of the simplest methods to estimate Expected Return is to calculate the historical mean return of an asset or a portfolio. This involves computing the average return over a specified historical period:

\[ E(R) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} R_i \]

Here, \(n\) is the number of historical periods (e.g., days, months, years), and \(R_i\) is the return in the \(i\)-th period.

### Probability Distribution

For investments with discrete outcomes, Expected Return can be calculated by assigning probabilities to different potential returns. For example, consider an investment with the following potential outcomes and associated probabilities:

- Return 10% with probability 0.3,
- Return 5% with probability 0.5,
- Return -2% with probability 0.2.

The Expected Return would be:

\[ E(R) = (0.3 \cdot 10\%) + (0.5 \cdot 5\%) + (0.2 \cdot (-2\%)) = 4.3\% \]

### Dividend Discount Model

For stocks, the Dividend Discount Model (DDM) can be used to estimate Expected Return, especially if the stock pays dividends. The DDM calculates the present value of expected future dividends:

\[ E(R) = \frac{D_1}{P_0} + g \]

where:
- \(D_1\) is the expected dividend in the next period,
- \(P_0\) is the current stock price,
- \(g\) is the growth rate of dividends.

### Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

The CAPM is another widely used model to estimate Expected Return, particularly in the context of diversified portfolios. It describes the relationship between systematic risk and Expected Return:

\[ E(R) = R_f + \beta(E(R_m) - R_f) \]

where:
- \(R_f\) is the risk-free rate,
- \(\beta\) is the beta of the investment (a measure of its volatility relative to the market),
- \(E(R_m)\) is the expected market return.

## Application in Algorithmic Trading

### Backtesting

Backtesting is a crucial phase in the development of any algorithmic trading strategy. It involves testing the strategy on historical data to assess its potential performance. Expected Return is used extensively in backtesting to measure the strategy's profitability and risk characteristics over the tested period.

### Real-Time Decision Making

In real-time trading, algorithms must make quick decisions based on the latest market data. Calculating the Expected Return on potential trades allows these algorithms to prioritize trades that offer the best risk-adjusted returns. This real-time analysis is vital for maintaining the trading edge provided by algorithmic strategies.

### Machine Learning and AI

Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are increasingly being employed in algorithmic trading to predict asset prices and develop trading strategies. Expected Return is often a target variable in supervised learning models, where the algorithms are trained to predict future returns based on historical data and various explanatory features.

### Risk Metrics and Adjustments

Algorithmic trading platforms often use Expected Return along with other risk metrics to dynamically adjust trading positions. These adjustments ensure that the overall risk exposure of the portfolio remains within the desired limits. For example, algorithms might reduce exposure to high-risk assets during periods of increased market volatility to protect the portfolio.

# Equity-Linked Note (ELN)

An [Equity](../e/equity.md)-Linked [Note](../n/note.md) (ELN) is a structured financial product that combines both [equity](../e/equity.md) [market exposure](../m/market_exposure.md) and [fixed income](../f/fixed_income.md) characteristics. These notes belong to the broader category of structured products and are typically issued by financial institutions such as banks and brokerage firms. ELNs can be an attractive investment for those looking to achieve higher returns than traditional fixed-[income](../i/income.md) securities while maintaining some level of [principal](../p/principal.md) protection. This document provides an in-depth examination of the structure, mechanics, risks, and benefits associated with [Equity](../e/equity.md)-Linked Notes.

## Structure of Equity-Linked Notes

### Basic Components

1. **[Principal](../p/principal.md) Amount**: This is the initial investment amount in the ELN, often referred to as the [face value](../f/face_value.md).
2. **[Maturity Date](../m/maturity_date.md)**: The date on which the ELN matures and the [investor](../i/investor.md) is repaid the [principal](../p/principal.md) amount, subject to the performance of the linked [equity](../e/equity.md).
3. **Linked [Equity](../e/equity.md)**: The specific stock, basket of [stocks](../s/stock.md), or [equity](../e/equity.md) [index](../i/index.md) to which the performance of the ELN is tied.
4. **[Interest](../i/interest.md)/[Dividend](../d/dividend.md) Payments**: Some ELNs may [offer](../o/offer.md) periodic [interest](../i/interest.md) payments, which could be fixed or variable based on the performance of the linked [equity](../e/equity.md). 

### Types of ELNs

1. **[Principal](../p/principal.md)-Protected ELNs**: Provide a guarantee that the [principal](../p/principal.md) amount [will](../w/will.md) be returned at [maturity](../m/maturity.md), regardless of the performance of the linked [equity](../e/equity.md). These products usually [offer](../o/offer.md) a lower [yield](../y/yield.md) due to the safety cushion.
2. **Non-[Principal](../p/principal.md)-Protected ELNs**: Do not [offer](../o/offer.md) any [principal](../p/principal.md) protection, thereby subjecting the [principal](../p/principal.md) amount to [market](../m/market.md) risks. These generally [offer](../o/offer.md) higher potential returns given the higher [risk](../r/risk.md).
3. **Coupon ELNs**: Provide periodic coupon payments, which are often contingent on the performance of the linked [equity](../e/equity.md).
4. **Zero-Coupon ELNs**: Do not provide any periodic payments. Instead, these are sold at a [discount](../d/discount.md) and the [return](../r/return.md) is realized as a lump sum at [maturity](../m/maturity.md).

## Mechanics of Equity-Linked Notes

### Issuance

ELNs are typically issued by financial institutions such as [investment banks](../i/investment_bank_(ib).md). The [issuer](../i/issuer.md) outlines the terms, including the linked [equity](../e/equity.md), the calculation of the [return](../r/return.md), and the level of [principal](../p/principal.md) protection. Once issued, these notes can be bought by investors, often through a [broker](../b/broker.md) or directly from the issuing institution.

### Performance Calculation

The [return](../r/return.md) on an ELN is usually linked to the performance of a particular [equity](../e/equity.md) or a basket of equities. This linkage can be realized in various ways:
 
1. **Direct [Correlation](../c/correlation.md)**: The [return](../r/return.md) is directly tied to the price change of the linked [equity](../e/equity.md).
2. **Option-Based**: The [return](../r/return.md) is calculated based on the [payout](../p/payout.md) of an embedded option within the ELN, such as a call or [put option](../p/put.md) on the linked [equity](../e/equity.md).

For example, an ELN might provide a 1:1 [participation rate](../p/participation_rate.md) in the appreciation of a certain stock. If the stock appreciates by 10%, the ELN [will](../w/will.md) provide a 10% [return](../r/return.md) on the [principal](../p/principal.md) amount. Alternatively, an ELN might also set a cap or a floor on the returns, e.g., providing gains up to a maximum of 15% but no further, regardless of the [equity](../e/equity.md) performance beyond that.

### Redemption

On the [maturity date](../m/maturity_date.md), the ELN is redeemed. The [principal](../p/principal.md) amount (and any [accrued interest](../a/accrued_interest.md) if applicable) is paid back to the [investor](../i/investor.md). In the case of a [principal](../p/principal.md)-protected ELN, the full [face value](../f/face_value.md) is returned, while in non-[principal](../p/principal.md)-protected ELNs, the [redemption](../r/redemption.md) [value](../v/value.md) may vary based on the performance of the linked [equity](../e/equity.md).

## Risks Associated with Equity-Linked Notes

[Investing](../i/investing.md) in [Equity](../e/equity.md)-Linked Notes involves various risks, some intrinsic to the nature of the linked [equity](../e/equity.md) and others related to the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) and product structure.

### Market Risk

The [value](../v/value.md) of the ELN is directly linked to the performance of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [equity](../e/equity.md) or equities. Therefore, the investors are exposed to the [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and [market risk](../m/market_risk.md) associated with these equities. If the linked [equity](../e/equity.md) performs poorly, the ELN may [yield](../y/yield.md) little or no [return](../r/return.md), and in the case of non-[principal](../p/principal.md)-protected ELNs, the [principal](../p/principal.md) may also be at [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Credit Risk

The ELN is a [debt](../d/debt.md) obligation of the issuing financial institution. Hence, the [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) of the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) is a pivotal [factor](../f/factor.md). If the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) faces financial difficulties or defaults, the investors may lose their [principal](../p/principal.md) and any expected returns. Major issuers are generally highly-rated financial institutions, but this [risk](../r/risk.md) cannot be entirely eliminated.

### Liquidity Risk

ELNs may have limited [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md) trading, meaning that investors may find it challenging to sell the notes before their [maturity](../m/maturity.md). The lack of [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) can result in potentially larger [bid](../b/bid.md)-ask [spreads](../s/spreads.md) and unfavorable prices if one attempts to exit the investment prematurely.

### Call Risk

Some ELNs include provisions that allow the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) to call the [note](../n/note.md) before its [maturity date](../m/maturity_date.md). This means the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) can redeem the [note](../n/note.md) earlier than expected, which can be disadvantageous if the [investor](../i/investor.md) was anticipating further performance gains from the [equity market](../e/equity_market.md).

### Currency Risk

For ELNs linked to foreign equities or issued in a foreign [currency](../c/currency.md), there is an additional layer of [currency](../c/currency.md) [risk](../r/risk.md). The [value](../v/value.md) of the investment could be affected by fluctuations in the [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) between the [investor](../i/investor.md)â€™s [home](../h/home.md) [currency](../c/currency.md) and the foreign [currency](../c/currency.md).

## Benefits of Equity-Linked Notes

Despite the risks, ELNs [offer](../o/offer.md) several benefits that can make them an attractive component of a diversified investment portfolio.

### Potential for Higher Returns

ELNs provide the opportunity to achieve higher returns compared to traditional fixed-[income](../i/income.md) investments like bonds and CDs. This is due to the [equity](../e/equity.md) component, which offers the potential for [capital](../c/capital.md) appreciation.

### Principal Protection

For [risk-averse](../r/risk-averse.md) investors, [principal](../p/principal.md)-protected ELNs [offer](../o/offer.md) a degree of safety as the [principal](../p/principal.md) investment is guaranteed, barring the [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) of the [issuer](../i/issuer.md). This allows investors to [gain](../g/gain.md) [equity](../e/equity.md) [market exposure](../m/market_exposure.md) without risking the loss of their initial investment.

### Customization and Flexibility

ELNs can be tailored to meet specific investment needs and objectives. Investors can choose from different types of linked equities, varying degrees of [principal](../p/principal.md) protection, and different durations. This customization allows for a tailored [risk](../r/risk.md)-[return](../r/return.md) profile suitable for different [market](../m/market.md) views and investment strategies.

### Tax Efficiency

ELNs can be structured to provide tax benefits. Depending on the jurisdiction and specific design of the [note](../n/note.md), some ELNs can be taxed more favorably compared to direct [equity](../e/equity.md) investments or other financial instruments.

## Conclusion

[Equity](../e/equity.md)-Linked Notes represent a compelling blend of fixed-[income](../i/income.md) and [equity](../e/equity.md) investment characteristics. They [offer](../o/offer.md) the potential for enhanced returns and customized [risk profiles](../r/risk_profiles.md). However, it is crucial for investors to carefully consider the associated [market](../m/market.md), [credit](../c/credit.md), [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), and other risks. Consulting with financial advisors and thoroughly understanding the terms and conditions of the specific ELN is essential to making informed investment decisions.

ELNs can be a valuable addition to a diversified investment portfolio, particularly for those seeking a balance between [fixed income](../f/fixed_income.md) and [equity](../e/equity.md) exposure, coupled with the potential for innovative structuring to meet tailored investment needs.

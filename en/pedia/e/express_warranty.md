# Express Warranty

## Introduction

An express [warranty](../w/warranty.md) is a seller’s promise or guarantee that a buyer relies on when purchasing an item. This promise can be a description of the item factually related to its quality, function, or form and is not limited to the written word; it includes oral statements, promises, and representations that contribute significantly to the formation of the buyer's expectations and their purchasing decision. Express warranties play a pivotal role in establishing [trust](../t/trust.md) and setting clear expectations between buyers and sellers, particularly in complex and high-stakes environments like [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md).

## Nature of Express Warranty

### Legal Definition
An express [warranty](../w/warranty.md) is defined under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), specifically in UCC § 2-313. According to this [provision](../p/provision.md), an express [warranty](../w/warranty.md) is created by:

1. Any affirmation of fact or promise made by the seller to the buyer which relates to the goods and becomes part of the [basis](../b/basis.md) of the bargain.
2. Any description of the goods which is made part of the [basis](../b/basis.md) of the bargain.
3. Any sample or model that is part of the [basis](../b/basis.md) of the bargain.

### Application in Algorithmic Trading
In [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), express warranties can be particularly crucial. These warranties might concern the performance of the [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md), the accuracy of financial data, software functionality, and the [operational efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md) of trading platforms.

## Key Aspects of an Express Warranty

### Performance Guarantees
A common type of express [warranty](../w/warranty.md) in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) is a performance guarantee. This can include assurances regarding:

- **[Execution](../e/execution.md) Speed**: Claims about how fast a trading algorithm can execute trades.
- **Profitability**: Promises or representations about the profitability or expected returns from using a specific algorithm.
- **Reliability and Uptime**: Guarantees related to system uptime and the reliability of the [trading platform](../t/trading_platform.md).

### Data Accuracy
Accuracy in financial data is paramount in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), where decisions are made in milliseconds based on [market](../m/market.md) data. Thus, companies might provide warranties on:

- **Data Integrity**: Guarantees that the data provided is accurate and free from errors.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Warranties that data is updated in real-time without delays which could affect trading decisions.

### Software Functionality
[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) heavily relies on software. Express warranties in this domain may relate to:

- **Compatibility**: Assurances that the trading software [will](../w/will.md) be compatible with existing systems.
- **[Security](../s/security.md)**: Warranties that the software includes [robust](../r/robust.md) [security](../s/security.md) features to protect against cyber threats.
- **Support and Maintenance**: Commitments to provide ongoing support and timely updates or patches.

## Creating and Enforcing Express Warranties

### Formation
Express warranties in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) contracts can be formed through various means:

- **Written Contracts**: Most formal and enforceable way to create an express [warranty](../w/warranty.md). Written contracts document specific promises and expectations.
- **[Marketing](../m/marketing.md) Materials**: Statements in brochures, advertisements, or on websites can also form an express [warranty](../w/warranty.md) if they contain specific assertions about product performance or capabilities.
- **Oral Statements**: Verbal assurances made by sales representatives or [customer](../c/customer.md) support can also constitute express warranties, though these are harder to prove in disputes.

### Enforcement
If a breach of an express [warranty](../w/warranty.md) occurs, the buyer can pursue several remedies. These might include:

- **Repair or Replacement**: The seller may be required to repair or replace the faulty goods or services.
- **Refund**: The buyer might be entitled to a full or partial refund.
- **Damages**: Monetary compensation for any losses incurred due to the breach of [warranty](../w/warranty.md).

## Examples and Case Studies

### Fin-tech Companies and Express Warranties
Several financial technology (fin-tech) companies provide express warranties as part of their service agreements:

- **[Bloomberg](../b/bloomberg.md)**: [Bloomberg](../b/bloomberg.md) may [warrant](../w/warrant.md) the accuracy and timeliness of its financial data and analytics (https://www.[bloomberg](../b/bloomberg.md).com/company/).

### Case Study: Algorithmic Trading Platforms
Consider an [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) platform promising a 99.9% uptime guarantee. If the platform experiences downtime beyond this limit, this could constitute a breach of their express [warranty](../w/warranty.md), entitling the user to compensation or other remedies as outlined in their service agreement.

## Conclusion

Express warranties ensure [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and reliability in transactions, particularly in critical areas like [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md). Understanding the nature, formation, and enforcement of these warranties helps protect both buyers and sellers by setting clear expectations and providing a framework for addressing any discrepancies or breaches that may arise.

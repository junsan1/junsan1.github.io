# Endogenous Variable

In the context of [econometrics](../e/econometrics_in_trading.md) and [financial modeling](../f/financial_modeling.md), an endogenous variable is one whose [value](../v/value.md) is influenced by other variables within the system being studied. Unlike [exogenous variables](../e/exogenous_variables_in_trading.md), which are assumed to be unaffected by other variables in the model, endogenous variables are determined internally by the relationships and interactions among variables in the model. This distinction plays a crucial role in understanding causality and the dynamics within economic and financial systems.

## Understanding Endogeneity

### Definition and Characteristics
Endogeneity refers to a situation where an explanatory variable is correlated with the [error term](../e/error_term.md) in a regression model. This [correlation](../c/correlation.md) can occur due to several reasons, including omitted variable bias, simultaneity, or measurement error. An endogenous variable can thus be considered as one that is influenced by the inherent structure of the model.

### Causes of Endogeneity
1. **Omitted Variable Bias**: If a model omits a variable that is correlated with both the dependent and independent variables, the omitted variable's effect may be falsely attributed to the included independent variable, leading to endogeneity.
2. **Simultaneity**: This occurs when causality between variables is bidirectional. For instance, in a [supply](../s/supply.md) and [demand](../d/demand.md) model, both price and quantity are endogenous because they influence each other.
3. **Measurement Error**: Errors in measuring the variables can lead to endogeneity if the measurement error is correlated with other variables in the model.

## Examples in Financial Modeling

1. **Stock Prices and [Interest](../i/interest.md) Rates**: In modeling stock prices, [interest](../i/interest.md) rates may be considered endogenous as they are influenced by central [bank](../b/bank.md) policies, which in turn might react to [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md) that also affect stock prices.
2. **Company Performance and Investment**: The performance of a company can be considered endogenous when modeling its investment decisions, as better performance may lead to more investment, which further enhances performance.

## Addressing Endogeneity

### Instrumental Variables (IV)
An instrumental variable is used to account for endogeneity by providing a source of variation that is correlated with the endogenous regressors but uncorrelated with the [error term](../e/error_term.md). The use of instrumental variables can help in obtaining consistent estimators.

### Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS)
This is a common method for dealing with endogeneity using instrumental variables. The first stage involves regressing the endogenous variable on the instruments to purge it of its [correlation](../c/correlation.md) with the [error term](../e/error_term.md). The second stage involves using the predicted values from the first stage in the main regression.

## Practical Application in Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) involves the use of computer programs and systems to execute trades at high speeds and volumes. The role of endogenous variables is integral as it helps in understanding the dynamics within [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). Examples include:

1. **Price Movements and Trading [Volume](../v/volume.md)**: Algorithms often [factor](../f/factor.md) in trading volumes as an endogenous variable, where price changes and volumes influence each other.
2. **[Market Sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) and [Asset](../a/asset.md) Prices**: [Sentiment analysis](../s/sentiment_analysis.md) can include endogenous variables where [market](../m/market.md) news and price movements have a bidirectional relationship.

### Case Study: "QuantConnect" Platform
[QuantConnect](../q/quantconnect.md) (https://www.[quantconnect](../q/quantconnect.md).com/) provides an [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) platform where endogeneity must be considered in designing [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md). Algorithms might consider endogenous variables like [historical volatility](../h/historical_volatility.md) and trading [volume](../v/volume.md) to predict stock movements effectively.

## Conclusion

Understanding and addressing endogeneity is crucial in [econometrics](../e/econometrics_in_trading.md) and [financial modeling](../f/financial_modeling.md) as it ensures the reliability and validity of the models. Techniques like instrumental variables and two-stage least squares are essential tools used by economists and financial analysts to mitigate issues arising from endogeneity, ensuring more accurate and [robust](../r/robust.md) modeling.

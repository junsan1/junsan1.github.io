# Earnings Yield

Earnings yield is a financial metric used to measure the earnings generated by a company relative to its share price. It is the inverse of the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and is expressed as a percentage. The formula for calculating earnings yield is:

\[ \text{Earnings Yield} = \frac{\text{Earnings Per Share (EPS)}}{\text{Share Price}} \times 100\% \]

In the context of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), earnings yield can be a critical parameter for designing [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) that aim to identify undervalued stocks or predict future price movements based on the company's earnings performance. This section explores the concept of earnings yield in detail, its importance, how it can be integrated into algo-[trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), and real-world applications.

### Importance of Earnings Yield
Earnings yield is an indicator of how much profit a company is making for every dollar invested by shareholders. It provides insight into:

1. **Valuation**: A higher earnings yield suggests that a stock is undervalued, making it an attractive investment. Conversely, a lower earnings yield indicates overvaluation.
2. **Risk Assessment**: Stocks with higher earnings yields are often less risky because they come with a cushion of earnings that can absorb potential declines in price.
3. **Comparative Measure**: It enables comparison between different stocks, sectors, or even with fixed-income securities like bonds. If a stock's earnings yield is higher than the prevailing bond yield, it could be a more attractive option.

### Calculating Earnings Yield
The calculation of earnings yield involves two primary components: Earnings Per Share (EPS) and the current share price.

1. **Earnings Per Share (EPS)**: This is the portion of a company's profit allocated to each outstanding share. It is calculated as:
\[ \text{EPS} = \frac{\text{Net Income - Dividends on Preferred Stock}}{\text{Average Outstanding Shares}} \]

2. **Share Price**: The current trading price of one share of the company's stock.

For example, if a company has an EPS of $5 and its current share price is $50, the earnings yield would be:
\[ \text{Earnings Yield} = \frac{5}{50} \times 100\% = 10\% \]

### Integration into Algorithmic Trading Strategies
[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) involves executing pre-programmed trading instructions based on various market data points. Integrating earnings yield into these strategies can enhance decision-making processes. Below are some methods to incorporate earnings yield into algo-[trading models](../t/trading_models.md):

1. **Screening and Filtering**: An algorithm can screen for stocks with earnings yields above a certain threshold, indicating potential undervaluation. For instance, an algorithm might search for stocks with earnings yields above 8%.

2. **[Portfolio Optimization](../p/portfolio_optimization.md)**: Algorithms can be designed to optimize portfolios by prioritizing stocks with higher earnings yields. This can help in building a portfolio that balances growth and value stocks, potentially leading to better risk-adjusted returns.

3. **Predictive Models**: Machine learning models can use historical earnings yields, among other factors, to predict future stock prices or price movements. By analyzing patterns and correlations, these models can generate buy or sell signals.

4. **Pair Trading**: Involving simultaneous buying and selling of related stocks, pair [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) can benefit from earnings yield by pairing a high-yield stock with a low-yield one within the same sector.

5. **Factor-Based Strategies**: Earnings yield can be one of the multiple factors in multifactor [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). Combining it with other financial metrics (like P/E ratio, dividend yield, etc.) can improve the robustness of the trading strategy.

### Real-World Application

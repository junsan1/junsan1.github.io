# Economic Value Added (EVA)

[Economic Value](../e/economic_value.md) Added (EVA) is an important [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) metric that provides insights into the true economic [profit](../p/profit.md) of a company. It goes beyond traditional measures of profitability by integrating the [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md) into the evaluation, thus [offering](../o/offering.md) a comprehensive understanding of how well a company is generating [value](../v/value.md) for its shareholders.

## Introduction

EVA is essentially the [surplus](../s/surplus.md) [value](../v/value.md) created over the required [return](../r/return.md) of a company’s shareholders. The main idea behind EVA is to measure whether the [business](../b/business.md)’ [earnings](../e/earnings.md) are sufficient to compensate for the [opportunity cost](../o/opportunity_cost.md) of [capital](../c/capital.md). Developed by Stern Stewart & Co., EVA encourages companies to focus on generating [value](../v/value.md) rather than just hitting [earnings](../e/earnings.md) targets. 

EVA is calculated using the following formula:
```
EVA = NOPAT - ([CAPITAL](../c/capital.md) * WACC)
```
Where:
- **NOPAT (Net [Operating Profit](../o/operating_profit.md) After [Taxes](../t/taxes.md)):** It measures the company’s potential [earnings](../e/earnings.md) before [financing](../f/financing.md) costs and after operating expenses and [taxes](../t/taxes.md).
- **[CAPITAL](../c/capital.md):** The amount of [capital](../c/capital.md) invested and employed in the [business](../b/business.md).
- **WACC ([Weighted Average](../w/weighted_average.md) [Cost of Capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md)):** It represents the average [rate of return](../r/rate_of_return.md) expected by all of the company's investors, including [debt](../d/debt.md) holders and [equity](../e/equity.md) holders.

## Significance of EVA

### Alignment with Shareholder Interests

One of the [principal](../p/principal.md) benefits of EVA is its direct alignment with [shareholder value](../s/shareholder_value.md) creation. Since EVA considers the [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md), it ensures that managers are motivated to undertake projects that [will](../w/will.md) [yield](../y/yield.md) returns exceeding this cost, thereby creating [wealth](../w/wealth.md) for the shareholders.

### Decision-making Tool

EVA serves as a useful [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for strategic decision-making. By emphasizing the true economic [profit](../p/profit.md), managers can better assess the profitability of various initiatives and investments, making informed decisions that enhance long-term [shareholder value](../s/shareholder_value.md).

### Performance Measurement

Companies use EVA as a performance measurement tool to assess managerial effectiveness. Decisions that lead to a positive EVA signal smart [capital](../c/capital.md) utilization and effective management, while a negative EVA might indicate suboptimal investment decisions.

## Calculation Components

### Net Operating Profit After Taxes (NOPAT)

NOPAT is an [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of a company’s [operational efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md) and its ability to generate [profit](../p/profit.md) from core operations. It is calculated as follows:
```
NOPAT = [Operating Income](../o/operating_income.md) * (1 - [Tax Rate](../t/tax_rate.md))
```
The [operating income](../o/operating_income.md) reflects [earnings](../e/earnings.md) before [interest](../i/interest.md) and [taxes](../t/taxes.md) (EBIT), and it’s adjusted to reflect the tax impact.

### Capital

[Capital](../c/capital.md) includes both [equity](../e/equity.md) and [debt financing](../d/debt_financing.md) used to [fund](../f/fund.md) the company's operations. It is typically broken down into:
- **[Equity](../e/equity.md):** The shareholders' investment in the company.
- **[Debt](../d/debt.md):** Loans and other forms of borrowings.

### Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)

WACC represents the blended cost of a company’s [capital](../c/capital.md) from all sources, including [equity](../e/equity.md) and [debt](../d/debt.md). It is calculated using the formula:
```
WACC = (E/V * Re) + ((D/V * Rd) * (1 - Tc))
```
Where:
- **E:** [Market value](../m/market_value.md) of the company’s [equity](../e/equity.md).
- **V:** Total [market value](../m/market_value.md) of the company’s [financing](../f/financing.md) ([equity](../e/equity.md) and [debt](../d/debt.md)).
- **Re:** [Cost of equity](../c/cost_of_equity.md).
- **D:** [Market value](../m/market_value.md) of the company’s [debt](../d/debt.md).
- **Rd:** [Cost of debt](../c/cost_of_debt.md).
- **Tc:** [Corporate tax](../c/corporate_tax.md) rate.

## Use Cases and Implementation

### Corporate Strategy

EVA can be integral in guiding corporate strategy. Companies might use EVA to evaluate prospective mergers and acquisitions, new product lines, or [market](../m/market.md) expansions. Areas yielding high EVA typically indicate opportunities that would enhance [shareholder value](../s/shareholder_value.md).

### Incentive Systems

Many companies adopt EVA-based incentive systems to align executive compensation with long-term [value](../v/value.md) creation. For example, bonuses might be tied to the achievement of target EVA figures, thus fostering a culture of accountability and performance.

### Financial Performance

EVA provides deeper insights into [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) compared to conventional metrics like [Earnings](../e/earnings.md) Per Share (EPS) or [Return](../r/return.md) on Investment (ROI). For instance, a high net [income](../i/income.md) might still result in a negative EVA if the [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md) surpasses the generated [earnings](../e/earnings.md), highlighting potential inefficiencies.

### Industry Benchmarks

[Comparative analysis](../c/comparative_analysis.md) using EVA across [industry](../i/industry.md) competitors helps to [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) performance. Companies strive not only to achieve positive EVA but to excel against [industry](../i/industry.md) norms, illustrating superior management and operational efficacy.

## Real-world Examples

### Dell Technologies

Dell Technologies, a multinational computer technology company, integrates EVA into its corporate financial analyses to drive [value](../v/value.md)-based management. By employing EVA, Dell ensures that [capital](../c/capital.md) is allocated efficiently, enhancing decision-making processes and [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) returns.

### United Parcel Service (UPS)

United Parcel Service (UPS), a global package delivery and [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md) management company, uses EVA as a key metric in evaluating its [business](../b/business.md) segments. EVA-based evaluation enables UPS to focus on initiatives that bolster long-term growth and sustainability.

### Coca-Cola

Coca-Cola utilizes EVA extensively to measure the performance of different projects and investments. The framework allows Coca-Cola to maximize economic [profit](../p/profit.md) by scrutinizing projects' contributions to the overall [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md) and ensuring that only [value](../v/value.md)-enhancing initiatives are pursued.

## Criticisms and Challenges

### Complexity

One criticism of EVA is its complexity and the amount of data required for accurate computation. Calculating WACC involves sophisticated [financial forecasting](../f/financial_forecasting.md), and adjustments to [accounting](../a/accounting.md) figures may [demand](../d/demand.md) substantial effort.

### Subjectivity

Another challenge is the potential subjectivity in estimating the [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md) and operating adjustments. [Variability](../v/variability.md) in assumptions can lead to inconsistent EVA figures, affecting comparability and decision-making quality.

### Short-term Focus

While EVA aims to foster long-term [value](../v/value.md) creation, excessive focus on annual EVA targets might sometimes encourage a short-term outlook among managers, potentially jeopardizing sustainable performance.

## Conclusion

[Economic Value](../e/economic_value.md) Added (EVA) is a powerful tool for evaluating a company's true economic [profit](../p/profit.md) by incorporating the [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md) into financial assessments. By focusing on EVA, companies can align management objectives with [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) interests, enhance strategic decision-making, and improve performance measurement. While complex and subjective in nature, the advantages of driving [capital](../c/capital.md)-efficient decisions and fostering long-term [value](../v/value.md) creation make EVA an indispensable metric in [finance](../f/finance.md) and corporate management.

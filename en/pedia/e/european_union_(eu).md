## Definition
The **European Union (EU)** is a political and economic union of member countries that are located primarily in Europe. It was established to foster economic cooperation, create a single market, and promote peace and stability in the region.

## Key Components
1. **Member States**: The EU currently consists of 27 member countries.
2. **Institutions**: Key institutions include the European Commission, European Parliament, European Council, and the Court of Justice of the European Union.

2. **Expansion**: The EU has expanded from the original six founding members (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands) to its current 27 members.

## Institutions and Functions

2. **European Parliament**: The legislative body elected by EU citizens that works with the Council of the European Union to adopt legislation and budgets.

## Challenges
1. **Brexit**: The United Kingdom's exit from the EU has posed challenges for economic relations and regulatory alignment.
2. **Economic Disparities**: Differences in economic development and living standards between member states require ongoing cohesion efforts.
3. **Migration**: Managing migration flows and integrating immigrants while maintaining security and social harmony.
4. **Sovereignty**: Balancing the EU’s supranational governance with the national sovereignty of member states.

## Conclusion

# Euro Overnight Index Average (Eonia)

The [Euro](../e/euro.md) Overnight [Index](../i/index.md) Average, commonly known as Eonia, is a measure of the effective [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) in the European interbank lending [market](../m/market.md). Calculated by the European Central [Bank](../b/bank.md) (ECB), it represents the [weighted average](../w/weighted_average.md) of all overnight unsecured lending transactions initiated within the Eurosystem by banks. Eonia is pivotal for various financial products and serves as a [reference rate](../r/reference_rate.md) within the broader [financial system](../f/financial_system.md), particularly in the context of monetary policies implemented by the European Central [Bank](../b/bank.md).

## Historical Context

Eonia was first introduced in 1999 in conjunction with the establishment of the [euro](../e/euro.md). It was created to provide [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and stability in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), especially for institutions participating in overnight lending and borrowing activities. The establishment of Eonia played a significant role in unifying the fragmented [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) landscape across the [Eurozone](../e/eurozone.md).

## Calculation Methodology

Eonia is computed on a daily [basis](../b/basis.md), reflecting the performance of overnight lending transactions carried out by a predefined panel of contributing banks. The methodology is structured as follows:

1. **Data Collection**: Each [business](../b/business.md) day, contributing banks report their overnight borrowing and lending transactions.
2. **[Weighted Average](../w/weighted_average.md) Calculation**: The ECB then aggregates these transactions, computing a [weighted average](../w/weighted_average.md) where weights correspond to [transaction](../t/transaction.md) volumes.
3. **Publication**: The resulting rate is published around 7 PM Central European Time (CET) on the same day.

This process ensures that Eonia captures a real-time snapshot of the cost of unsecured overnight borrowing within the [Eurozone](../e/eurozone.md) banking system.

## Major Contributors

The Eonia panel comprises a selection of leading banks actively participating in the overnight [money market](../m/money_market.md). These institutions are pivotal in supplying data that shapes the Eonia rate. Notable contributors have traditionally included major banks such as:

- Deutsche [Bank](../b/bank.md)
- BNP Paribas
- UniCredit
- Societé Générale
- Barclays

## Eonia's Role in Financial Markets

Eonia serves several critical functions:

### Benchmarking and Reference Rate

Eonia is widely used as a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) rate for various financial instruments, including:

- **Short-term [interest rate swaps](../i/interest_rate_swaps.md)**: Eonia-linked swaps allow financial institutions to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against, or speculate on, changes in overnight [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.
- **[Floating Rate Notes](../f/floating_rate_notes.md) (FRNs)**: These instruments often have their [interest](../i/interest.md) payments tied to Eonia, serving to adjust the coupons periodically according to current Eonia rates.
- **Repurchase Agreements (Repos)**: The repo [market](../m/market.md) relies on Eonia as a reference for the cost of borrowing funds overnight.

### Monetary Policy Implementation

The ECB leverages Eonia to gauge the effectiveness of its monetary policies. Given that Eonia reflects the cost of overnight borrowing, it provides insights into [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) conditions within the banking system. The ECB's policy actions, such as changes in the main refinancing operations rate or [deposit](../d/deposit.md) [facility](../f/facility.md) rate, often influence Eonia, helping the central [bank](../b/bank.md) to guide short-term [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

### Economic Significance

Eonia is a critical [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of the health and stability of the [Eurozone](../e/eurozone.md)'s banking sector. A rising Eonia typically suggests tightening [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), potentially signaling higher [risk](../r/risk.md) perceptions or a lack of available cash among banks. Conversely, a falling Eonia indicates ample [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and reduced cost of borrowing, reflecting more stable [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

## Transition to €STR

On October 2, 2019, the European Central [Bank](../b/bank.md) introduced the [Euro](../e/euro.md) Short-Term Rate (€STR), designed to eventually replace Eonia. This transition was driven by the need for a more [robust](../r/robust.md) [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) adhering to international standards, particularly in light of reforms undertaken following the LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) scandal. €STR is based on a broader set of data and offers enhanced [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and representativeness.

### Key Differences Between Eonia and €STR

1. **Data [Scope](../s/scope.md)**: €STR includes a broader [range](../r/range.md) of transactions, encompassing more firms beyond banks and different [money market](../m/money_market.md) segments.
2. **Methodology**: €STR is computed based on actual transactions rather than quotes from a panel of banks, reducing potential for manipulation.
3. **Implementation Timeline**: While Eonia continues to be published, it is now derived by adding a fixed spread to €STR, a transitional measure until Eonia is ultimately phased out.

## Implications for Market Participants

For [market](../m/market.md) participants, the shift from Eonia to €STR necessitates several adjustments, including:

- **Contract Amendments**: Financial instruments and contracts referencing Eonia need to be amended to incorporate references to €STR.
- **System Updates**: [Trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md), [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) tools, and settlement systems require updates to accommodate the new [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md).
- **Education and Communication**: Comprehensive efforts to educate all stakeholders about the nuances of €STR versus Eonia are essential to ensure a smooth transition.

## Conclusion

Eonia has historically been a cornerstone of the [Eurozone](../e/eurozone.md)'s financial [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md), providing critical insights into the overnight lending [market](../m/market.md) and serving as a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for myriad financial products. As financial systems evolve, the transition to €STR marks a significant shift towards more reliable and transparent benchmarks.

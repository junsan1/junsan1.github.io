# Elliott Wave Patterns

Elliott Wave Patterns are a form of technical analysis used in stock and forex trading to predict market trends by identifying recurring fractal wave patterns. The theory was developed by Ralph Nelson Elliott in the 1930s after he observed that financial markets do not behave in a chaotic manner but instead form identifiable patterns due to the collective psychology of investors.

## Fundamental Concepts

### Waves

Elliott Wave Theory is built on the premise that market movements can be divided into impulsive waves and corrective waves. An impulsive wave moves in the direction of the main trend, while a corrective wave moves against it.

1. **Impulsive Waves**: These are the primary waves in the direction of the trend. An impulsive wave consists of five smaller waves: three of them are also impulsive (moving in the trend's direction) and two are corrective (moving against the trend).
2. **Corrective Waves**: These are patterns that occur after an impulsive wave, and they generally consist of three smaller waves. Corrective waves are subdivided into zigzags, flats, and triangles.

## Patterns and Their Characteristics

### Impulse Waves

Impulse waves are the dominant waves in the market trend, broken down into five-wave structures.

1. **Wave 1**: Often hard to identify as it is usually thought of as the end of the previous trend.
2. **Wave 2**: Wave 2 corrects Wave 1 but cannot retrace more than 100% of Wave 1.
3. **Wave 3**: This wave is usually the longest and most powerful. It often represents strong investor confidence.
4. **Wave 4**: Wave 4 is a corrective wave and can overlap with the end of Wave 1 territory in some scenarios.
5. **Wave 5**: This final wave in the impulsive phase can vary in length and typically shows weaker momentum compared to Wave 3.

### Corrective Waves

Corrective waves move against the trend established by the impulsive waves and present in three main forms:

1. **Zigzag (5-3-5)**: Composed of three waves, labeled A, B, and C. In this pattern, Wave B is typically the shortest.
2. **Flat (3-3-5)**: All waves are similar in length. Wave C tends to be slightly longer than Wave A.
3. **Triangle (3-3-3-3-3)**: Consists of five waves that move within converging trendlines, forming a symmetrical pattern.

### Fractals and Nesting

Elliott Wave Theory assumes that these patterns are fractal in nature, meaning they repeat at different sizes and scales. Each wave can be divided into smaller waves, and each of those smaller waves can be divided into even smaller waves, theoretically ad infinitum.

## Fibonacci Ratios

Elliott also applied Fibonacci ratios to his wave patterns. Some key Fibonacci ratios used in wave analysis include 1.618, 0.618, and 2.618, among others. These ratios help to identify the probable length and duration of market waves:

1. **Retracement Levels**: 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 100%.
2. **Extension Levels**: 161.8%, 261.8%, and sometimes 423.6%.

## Application in Modern Trading

## Criticisms and Limitations

While Elliott Wave Theory is a powerful tool, it is also subject to criticism for its subjective nature. Different analysts might interpret the same market conditions differently, leading to variability in predictions. It also requires a considerable amount of skill and experience to apply correctly.

### Subjectivity

Because many parts of Elliott Wave Theory involve interpreting patterns and deciding wave counts, analysts may disagree on wave labels and future projections.

### Complexity

The fractal nature and multiple forms of corrective waves can make identifying the exact structure of the current market challenging, often leading to different interpretations.

### Confirmation Bias

Traders may sometimes force wave patterns to fit pre-existing biases or expectations, leading to potential errors in market predictions.

## Conclusion

Elliott Wave Patterns constitute an advanced and sophisticated tool in the arsenal of technical analysts and traders. While it offers detailed insights into market psychology and structure, it remains a complex and somewhat subjective methodology. Nonetheless, with diligent study and practice, traders can harness the power of Elliott Wave Theory to better predict market movements and make informed trading decisions.

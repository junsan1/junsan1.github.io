# Elliott Wave Theory

Elliott [Wave Theory](../w/wave_theory.md) is a form of [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) that traders use to analyze financial [market cycles](../m/market_cycles.md) and forecast market trends by identifying extreme price movements and investor psychology. Developed by Ralph Nelson Elliott in the 1930s, the theory posits that the market follows specific patterns or "waves" that are cyclical in nature.

## Basic Concept

The Elliott [Wave Theory](../w/wave_theory.md) is based on the premise that market prices unfold in specific patterns, which Elliott referred to as waves. These waves are fractal in nature, meaning they can be observed on any time frame, whether it's a [1-minute chart](../1/1-minute_chart.md) or a monthly chart. The theory divides price movements into two main types: motive waves and corrective waves.

### Motive Waves

Motive waves are the waves that move in the direction of the larger trend and are subdivided into five smaller waves. These five smaller waves consist of three impulse waves and two corrective waves, forming a 5-3 pattern. In simpler terms, a motive wave is a series of price movements that exhibits a general upward or downward direction.

1. **Wave 1**: The initial wave that starts the movement in the direction of the larger trend.
2. **Wave 2**: A corrective wave that retraces some portion of Wave 1.
3. **Wave 3**: The strongest and most extended wave in the sequence, moving in the direction of the larger trend.
4. **Wave 4**: Another corrective wave that retraces some portion of Wave 3, but does not overlap with the price territory of Wave 1.
5. **Wave 5**: The final wave in the motive wave, again moving in the direction of the larger trend, but generally not as strong as Wave 3.

### Corrective Waves

Corrective waves are the waves that move against the direction of the larger trend and generally subdivide into three smaller waves. These are often labeled as A, B, and C. The corrective waves usually form a 3-wave pattern:

1. **Wave A**: The initial wave moving against the direction of the larger trend.
2. **Wave B**: A corrective wave that retraces some portion of Wave A.
3. **Wave C**: The final wave in the correction, moving against the direction of the larger trend and usually equaling the length of Wave A.

## Wave Patterns

### Impulse Waves

Impulse waves are the most straightforward type of motive wave and consist of five waves: three that move in the direction of the trend (waves 1, 3, and 5) and two that move against it (waves 2 and 4). Impulse waves follow specific rules:

1. Wave 2 cannot retrace more than 100% of Wave 1.
2. Wave 3 cannot be the shortest of the three impulse waves.
3. Wave 4 cannot overlap with the price territory of Wave 1, except in special cases like a diagonal triangle.

### Diagonal Triangles

Diagonal triangles are a special type of impulse wave and can appear as both leading diagonals (in the 1st wave position) and ending diagonals (in the 5th wave position). Diagonal triangles are characterized by overlapping waves and take a wedge shape. They differ from standard impulse waves in that waves 1, 3, and 5 themselves often subdivide into three waves.

### Corrective Wave Structures

Corrective waves come in various structures:

1. **Zigzags**: A sharp correction made up of three waves labeled A, B, and C. The structure often appears as a [5-3-5 wave pattern](../1/5-3-5_wave_pattern.md).
2. **Flats**: A sideways correction made up of three waves, where wave B retraces most or all of wave A, and wave C is typically equal in length to wave A. The structure often appears as a 3-3-5 wave pattern.
3. **Triangles**: A sideways movement composed of five waves labeled A, B, C, D, and E. Triangles can be ascending, descending, or contracting, but generally take a 3-3-3-3-3 wave form.
4. **Complex Corrections**: Combinations of the simpler types of corrections (zigzags, flats) that are more difficult to identify and analyze.

## Fibonacci Relationships

A key element of Elliott [Wave Theory](../w/wave_theory.md) is the use of Fibonacci numbers, which are naturally occurring ratios that Elliott found repeat within the wave structures. The most common Fibonacci ratios used in Elliott [Wave Analysis](../w/wave_analysis.md) are 0.618 and 1.618. Traders use these ratios to predict the lengths of future waves or retracements:

1. **Wave 2**: Often retraces 50-61.8% of Wave 1.
2. **Wave 3**: Commonly extends 1.618 times the length of Wave 1.
3. **Wave 4**: Typically retraces 38.2-50% of Wave 3.
4. **Wave 5**: Often equals the length of Wave 1 or 0.618 times the length of Wave 3.

## Practical Applications

Traders and analysts use the Elliott [Wave Theory](../w/wave_theory.md) to forecast future market movements by identifying and labeling the waves within price charts. Software programs like [Elliott Wave International's](https://www.elliottwave.com) proprietary Auto-Wave software help automate this process.

### Identifying Wave Patterns

Experienced traders often combine Elliott [Wave Theory](../w/wave_theory.md) with other forms of [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md), such as trend lines, moving averages, and [momentum indicators](../m/momentum_indicators.md), to increase the accuracy of their predictions. Identifying wave patterns typically involves looking for the following:

1. Completeness of wave structures: Ensuring that the current wave structure adheres to established Elliott wave rules.
2. Fibonacci levels: Confirming that wave retracements and extensions align with Fibonacci ratios.
3. Supporting indicators: Using volume, momentum, and other [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) to confirm wave counts.

### Risk Management

Given the fractal nature of waves, it can sometimes be challenging to accurately determine the current wave position, making [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) critical. Traders often set [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md) at key Fibonacci levels or previous wave highs/lows to manage their risk.

### Limitations and Criticisms

Despite its widespread use, Elliott [Wave Theory](../w/wave_theory.md) has its critics. One primary criticism is the subjectivity involved in labeling waves, leading to different interpretations by different analysts. Others argue that the predictive power of Elliott [Wave Theory](../w/wave_theory.md) can be limited by the same randomness that often characterizes financial markets.

## Conclusion

The Elliott [Wave Theory](../w/wave_theory.md) remains a popular tool among traders and analysts for forecasting market trends. Its reliance on wave patterns and Fibonacci ratios offers a structured method to predict price movements and investor behaviors. Despite its criticisms and challenges, when combined with other [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) tools, Elliott [Wave Theory](../w/wave_theory.md) can be a powerful component of a trader's toolkit.

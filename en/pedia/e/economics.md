3. **Elasticity**: Measures how much the quantity demanded or supplied of a good responds to changes in price or other factors.
4. **Market Equilibrium**: The point where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied, resulting in a stable market price.
5. **Comparative Advantage**: The ability of a country or firm to produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than others, leading to trade and specialization.

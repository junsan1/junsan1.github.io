# Earned Income Credit (EITC)

The [Earned Income](../e/earned_income.md) [Credit](../c/credit.md) (EITC), also known as the [Earned Income](../e/earned_income.md) [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md), is a financial benefit provided to working individuals and families with low to moderate [income](../i/income.md). This program was established in 1975 and has since become one of the largest means-tested cash benefits programs in the United States. The EITC aims to reduce the tax burden on low-[income](../i/income.md) workers, supplement their wages, and provide an incentive to work.

## Overview of the EITC

The EITC is a refundable [tax credit](../t/tax_credit.md), meaning that if the amount of the [credit](../c/credit.md) exceeds the amount of [taxes](../t/taxes.md) owed, the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) [will](../w/will.md) receive the difference as a refund. This [credit](../c/credit.md) has been credited with lifting millions of Americans out of [poverty](../p/poverty.md) annually by effectively increasing the [income](../i/income.md) of low-wage earners.

To qualify for the EITC, individuals and families must meet specific criteria regarding [income](../i/income.md), [filing status](../f/filing_status.md), and number of qualifying children. The [credit](../c/credit.md) amount varies depending on these factors. In general, the more qualifying children a [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) has, the higher the [credit](../c/credit.md) amount they can receive.

## Basic Eligibility Requirements

### Income Limits

The EITC has strict [income](../i/income.md) limits that adjust annually based on [inflation](../i/inflation.md). To qualify, a [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md)'s [earned income](../e/earned_income.md) and adjusted [gross income](../g/gross_income.md) (AGI) must be below certain thresholds. The 2023 [income](../i/income.md) limits are as follows:

- No children: $15,820 (single), $21,710 ([married filing jointly](../m/married_filing_jointly.md))
- One child: $41,095 (single), $47,885 ([married filing jointly](../m/married_filing_jointly.md))
- Two children: $46,703 (single), $53,493 ([married filing jointly](../m/married_filing_jointly.md))
- Three or more children: $50,162 (single), $56,942 ([married filing jointly](../m/married_filing_jointly.md))

### Filing Status

To claim the EITC, a [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) must file their [taxes](../t/taxes.md) under one of the following statuses:

- Single
- [Married filing jointly](../m/married_filing_jointly.md)
- [Head of household](../h/head_of_household.md)
- Qualifying widow(er) with a dependent child

### Qualifying Children

A qualifying child for EITC purposes must meet four tests:

1. **Relationship Test**: The child must be the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md)’s son, daughter, stepchild, foster child, or a descendant of any of them. The child can also be the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md)'s brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister, or a descendant of any of them.
2. **Age Test**: The child must be under the age of 19, or under 24 if a full-time student, or any age if permanently and totally disabled.
3. **Residency Test**: The child must have lived with the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) in the United States for more than half of the year.
4. **[Joint Return Test](../j/joint_return_test.md)**: The child cannot file a [joint return](../j/joint_return.md) for the year unless they did so only to claim a refund.

### Other Requirements

Taxpayers also must meet the following additional criteria to be eligible for the EITC:

- Must have [earned income](../e/earned_income.md) from employment, [self-employment](../s/self-employment.md), or another source.
- Cannot use the "[married filing separately](../m/married_filing_separately.md)" status.
- Both the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) and any qualifying children must have a valid [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) number.
- The [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) must be a U.S. citizen or [resident alien](../r/resident_alien.md) for the entire year.
- Cannot have [investment income](../i/investment_income.md) (such as [interest](../i/interest.md), dividends, or [income](../i/income.md) from rental properties) exceeding $10,300 for the year.

## Calculation of the Credit

The amount of the EITC varies based on the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md)’s [earned income](../e/earned_income.md), adjusted [gross income](../g/gross_income.md), and number of qualifying children. Specifically, the [credit](../c/credit.md) is calculated as a percentage of [earned income](../e/earned_income.md) up to a maximum amount, after which the [credit](../c/credit.md) plateaus and then phases out as [income](../i/income.md) increases beyond certain thresholds.

### Credit Amounts

As of 2023, the maximum [credit](../c/credit.md) amounts are:

- No children: up to $600
- One child: up to $3,995
- Two children: up to $6,604
- Three or more children: up to $7,430

### Phase-In and Phase-Out

The EITC has a phase-in rate, a plateau where the maximum [credit](../c/credit.md) is reached, and a phase-out rate where the [credit](../c/credit.md) decreases to zero. The phase-in and phase-out rates are higher for taxpayers with qualifying children.

For example, in 2023 for a married couple with one child:
- The [credit](../c/credit.md) phases in at 34% of [earned income](../e/earned_income.md) up to $10,640.
- The maximum [credit](../c/credit.md) of $3,995 is reached between $10,640 and $19,560.
- The phase-out starts at an [income](../i/income.md) of $21,710 and ends at $47,885.

## Impact and Importance

### Poverty Reduction

The EITC is one of the most effective anti-[poverty](../p/poverty.md) programs in the United States. Studies show that it lifts approximately 6 million people out of [poverty](../p/poverty.md) each year, including about 3 million children. By supplementing the [income](../i/income.md) of low-wage workers, it helps to reduce the [poverty](../p/poverty.md) gap and improve the living standards of millions of households.

### Work Incentive

The EITC is designed to encourage employment among low-[income](../i/income.md) individuals. Unlike some other [welfare](../w/welfare.md) programs, which may reduce benefits as [earned income](../e/earned_income.md) increases (creating a disincentive to work), the EITC provides greater benefits as work efforts increase up to a certain point. This work-based nature of the EITC is a key [factor](../f/factor.md) in its bipartisan support.

### Economic Impact

The EITC has a positive [ripple](../r/ripple.md) effect on the [economy](../e/economy.md). Beneficiaries often spend their refunds on goods and services, thereby boosting [demand](../d/demand.md) and stimulating local economies. This increased consumption can lead to job creation and [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) in low-[income](../i/income.md) communities.

## Common Concerns and Criticisms

### Complexity

One of the most common criticisms of the EITC is that it can be complex for taxpayers to understand and claim accurately. Navigating the eligibility criteria, [income](../i/income.md) limits, and specific requirements can be challenging, leading to errors and, consequently, increased scrutiny from the IRS.

### Fraud and Non-compliance

The complexity of the EITC can also contribute to [fraud](../f/fraud.md) and non-compliance. There have been instances where taxpayers incorrectly claim the [credit](../c/credit.md), either unintentionally due to misunderstandings or intentionally through misreporting. The IRS estimates that roughly 25% of EITC claims are paid in error.

### Phase-Out Effect

Another [issue](../i/issue.md) raised by critics is the phase-out rate of the EITC, which can create a [marginal tax rate](../m/marginal_tax_rate.md) that discourages additional work efforts as taxpayers’ incomes near the phase-out thresholds. This "cliff effect" can result in some individuals facing high marginal tax rates that reduce the incentive to earn more.

## Effective Use and Filing Tips

### Tax Preparation Assistance

Many taxpayers eligible for the EITC seek assistance from professional tax preparers or [use tax](../u/use_tax.md) preparation software to ensure they claim the [credit](../c/credit.md) correctly. Services like IRS-certified Volunteer [Income Tax](../i/income_tax.md) Assistance (VITA) and the Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) programs [offer](../o/offer.md) free tax help to qualifying individuals.

### IRS Resources

The IRS provides a [range](../r/range.md) of resources to help taxpayers determine their eligibility and claim the EITC accurately. Tools like the EITC Assistant and detailed instructions on the IRS website (https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/earned-[income](../i/income.md)-tax-[credit](../c/credit.md)-eitc) are valuable for navigating the [credit](../c/credit.md).

### Awareness Campaigns

Various non-profits, community organizations, and government agencies conduct awareness campaigns to educate eligible taxpayers about the EITC. Increasing awareness and understanding of the [credit](../c/credit.md) is vital to ensuring that more eligible individuals and families claim the benefit they are entitled to receive.

## Changes and Legislative Proposals

### Recent Changes

The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 temporarily expanded the EITC for the tax year 2021, increasing the [credit](../c/credit.md) for workers without children and broadening eligibility by raising [income](../i/income.md) limits and making the [credit](../c/credit.md) available to workers aged 19-24 and over 65.

### Legislative Proposals

There have been numerous legislative proposals aimed at permanently expanding and improving the EITC. Proposals have included increasing the [credit](../c/credit.md) amounts, adjusting phase-out rates, and extending eligibility to more low-[income](../i/income.md) workers. These proposed changes aim to enhance the effectiveness of the EITC in lifting individuals and families out of [poverty](../p/poverty.md) and encouraging employment.

## Conclusion

The [Earned Income](../e/earned_income.md) [Credit](../c/credit.md) (EITC) is a vital financial assistance program for low- and moderate-[income](../i/income.md) workers in the United States. By reducing tax burdens and supplementing wages, the EITC helps to alleviate [poverty](../p/poverty.md), encourage work, and stimulate economic activity. While it faces challenges related to complexity and compliance, ongoing efforts to improve its administration and public awareness continue to make it an essential tool in the fight against [poverty](../p/poverty.md).

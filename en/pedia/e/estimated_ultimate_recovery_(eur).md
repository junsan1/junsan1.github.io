# Estimated Ultimate Recovery (EUR)

## Introduction
Estimated Ultimate Recovery (EUR) is a critical concept in the oil and gas [industry](../i/industry.md) that refers to the total quantity of hydrocarbons expected to be economically recoverable from a reservoir over its productive lifespan. EUR is used by energy companies, geologists, and investors to assess the potential profitability and longevity of oil and gas fields. This metric is essential for making informed decisions about exploration, development, and production activities.

## Calculation of EUR
EUR is calculated using various methods and models, often involving complex geological and engineering data. Large amounts of data are analyzed to estimate the physical and economic feasibility of [hydrocarbon](../h/hydrocarbon.md) recovery. Here are some common methods:

1. **Decline Curve Analysis (DCA):**
   - **Arps Decline Model:** The most common method, which projects future production based on past production trends. It involves three types of decline curves: exponential, hyperbolic, and harmonic.
   - **Exponential Decline:** Assumes a constant percentage decline rate.
   - **Hyperbolic Decline:** Incorporates a declining decline rate over time.
   - **Harmonic Decline:** Assumes a linear decline over time.

2. **Volumetric Methods:**
   - Involves calculating the [volume](../v/volume.md) of the reservoir rock that contains hydrocarbons, combined with the rock and fluid properties to estimate recoverable resources.

3. **Material Balance Equation (MBE):**
   - Uses reservoir pressure data and production data to estimate original hydrocarbons in place and ultimate recovery.

4. **Reservoir [Simulation](../s/simulation_in_trading.md):**
   - Uses complex computer models to simulate fluid flow within the reservoir, integrating geological, geophysical, and engineering data.

## Factors Influencing EUR
Several factors can influence the EUR of a reservoir, including:

- **Reservoir Characteristics:**
  - Porosity, permeability, and the natural drive mechanisms within the reservoir (e.g., water drive, gas cap drive).

- **Technological Advancements:**
  - Innovations in drilling and production technologies (e.g., [hydraulic fracturing](../h/hydraulic_fracturing.md), horizontal drilling).

- **[Economic Conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md):**
  - Fluctuations in oil and gas prices, which can impact the economic feasibility of extracting additional resources.

- **[Operational Efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md):**
  - Efficient field development and management practices.

- **Secondary and Enhanced Recovery Methods:**
  - Techniques such as water flooding, gas injection, and chemical flooding to improve recovery rates.

## Importance of EUR in Investment Decisions
EUR is crucial for investors and stakeholders as it affects the [valuation](../v/valuation.md) of oil and gas assets. Accurate EUR estimates help in:

- **[Asset Valuation](../a/asset_valuation.md):**
  - Determining the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of future cash flows from a reservoir.

- **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Assessment:**
  - Understanding the potential risks and uncertainties associated with [hydrocarbon](../h/hydrocarbon.md) extraction.

- **Strategic Planning:**
  - Guiding decisions on field development, [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) investments, and [portfolio management](../p/par.md).

- **Regulatory Compliance:**
  - Meeting reporting requirements and standards set by regulatory bodies.

## Case Study: Example of EUR in Action
Consider a hypothetical [oil field](../o/oil_field.md) "[Alpha](../a/alpha.md)." Using the Arps Decline Model, geologists and engineers have estimated the following production trends:

- **Initial Production Rate (Qi):** 1,000 barrels of oil per day (BOPD)
- **Decline Rate (Di):** 0.1 (10% per year)
- **Decline Type:** Exponential

The formula for exponential decline is:
\[ Q(t) = Q_i \cdot e^{-D_i t} \]

By integrating the production rate over time, we can calculate the EUR for the [Alpha](../a/alpha.md) field.

## Challenges and Limitations
Estimating EUR is fraught with challenges and uncertainties:

- **Data Quality:**
  - Inaccurate or incomplete data can lead to erroneous estimates.
  
- **Model Assumptions:**
  - Assumptions in various models may not always reflect reservoir complexities.

- **Economic [Uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md):**
  - Unpredictable changes in [market](../m/market.md) conditions can alter the validity of EUR estimates.

- **Technological Changes:**
  - Rapid advancements can both positively and negatively impact estimated recoveries.

## Conclusion
Estimated Ultimate Recovery (EUR) remains a cornerstone of the oil and gas [industry](../i/industry.md), providing a foundational [basis](../b/basis.md) for assessing the viability and profitability of [hydrocarbon](../h/hydrocarbon.md) reservoirs. Its accurate estimation requires a deep understanding of geological, engineering, and economic factors coupled with the use of advanced modeling techniques. Despite its challenges, EUR continues to play an indispensable role in guiding strategic decisions in the [energy sector](../e/energy_sector.md).

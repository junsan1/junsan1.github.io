# Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)

The Employee Retirement [Income](../i/income.md) [Security](../s/security.md) Act (ERISA) is a federal U.S. law that sets minimum standards for most voluntarily established pension and health plans in private [industry](../i/industry.md) to provide protection for individuals in these plans. Enacted in 1974, ERISA is crucial for safeguarding the retirement assets of Americans by implementing rules that qualified plans must follow to ensure plan fiduciaries do not misuse plan assets.

## Historical Context and Enactment

ERISA was signed into law by President Gerald Ford on September 2, 1974. The legislation was a response to publicized failures and mismanagement of pension plans. Notably, the collapse of the Studebaker [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) [pension plan](../p/pension_plan.md) in the early 1960s left many workers without retirement benefits, exemplifying the need for federal oversight and regulations to protect employee benefits.

## Scope of ERISA

ERISA covers a wide array of employee benefit plans including:

- Pension plans (both defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans)
- [Welfare](../w/welfare.md) benefit plans (such as [health insurance](../h/health_insurance.md), [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md), [disability insurance](../d/disability_insurance.md), etc.)

ERISA applies to [private sector](../p/private_sector.md) employers and does not cover government employee plans or plans intended solely for churches.

## Major Provisions of ERISA

### Fiduciary Responsibilities

A central aspect of ERISA is the requirement for plan fiduciaries to act in the best interests of plan participants. Fiduciaries are those who manage and control plan assets and they must adhere to principles of conduct known as fiduciary duties, which include:

- **Duty of Loyalty:** Acting solely in the [interest](../i/interest.md) of plan participants and beneficiaries.
- **Duty of Prudence:** Acting with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under prevailing circumstances.
- **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md):** Diversifying plan investments to minimize the [risk](../r/risk.md) of large losses.
- **Adherence:** Following the plan documents (to the extent that they comply with ERISA).

### Reporting and Disclosure

ERISA mandates extensive reporting and [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) requirements to ensure that participants are informed:

- **Summary Plan Description (SPD):** A document that outlines the major aspects of the plan.
- **[Annual Report](../a/annual_report.md) (Form 5500):** A detailed annual filing that provides financial information and details about the plan's operation.
- **Summary [Annual Report](../a/annual_report.md) (SAR):** A condensed version of the [annual report](../a/annual_report.md) distributed to participants.

### Participation, Vesting, and Benefit Accrual Standards

ERISA outlines specific criteria for plan participation, benefit accrual, and [vesting](../v/vesting.md):

- **Participation:** Sets minimum age and service requirements before an employee can participate in a plan (typically age 21 and one year of service).
- **[Vesting](../v/vesting.md):** Defines the non-forfeitable right to benefits; typically, participants become vested after five years of service (or in some cases, three years for employer contributions).
- **Benefit Accrual:** Dictates how benefits are earned over time and ensures fairness in the accumulation of benefits.

### Plan Funding

ERISA has rigorous funding standards for defined benefit plans to ensure adequate funds are available to meet future [obligations](../o/obligation.md). Employers must meet minimum funding requirements and make regular contributions to the planâ€™s [trust](../t/trust.md).

### Protection of Benefits and PBGC

The law established the Pension Benefit Guaranty [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) (PBGC), a federal agency that insures defined benefit plans. If a covered [pension plan](../p/pension_plan.md) is terminated with [insufficient funds](../i/insufficient_funds.md), PBGC steps in to pay out the benefits (up to legal limits).

### Preemption of State Laws

ERISA preempts any state laws that relate to employee benefit plans, providing uniformity in the administration of these plans across states. This preemption helps to avoid a patchwork of state laws and makes it easier for employers to manage plans that span [multiple](../m/multiple.md) states.

## ERISA and Health Plans

ERISA's impact is not limited to pension plans; it also affects health and [welfare](../w/welfare.md) benefit plans:

- **Patient Rights:** While ERISA itself does not ensure specific health protections, it lays the groundwork for subsequent regulations like COBRA and HIPAA.
- **Claims and Appeals Process:** ERISA sets standards for the process through which participants can file claims for benefits and appeal denials.

## ERISA Enforcement

The Department of Labor (DOL) enforces compliance with ERISA through its Employee Benefits [Security](../s/security.md) Administration (EBSA). The DOL has the authority to conduct investigations and impose penalties for non-compliance.

Participants can also bring lawsuits in federal court to pursue claims for benefits and breaches of fiduciary duty.

## Recent Developments and Proposed Changes

ERISA continually evolves:

- **Fiduciary Rule:** Attempts to redefine who is considered a fiduciary, especially concerning retirement investment advisers.
- **Healthcare Reforms:** Ongoing changes in healthcare regulations impact ERISA [welfare](../w/welfare.md) plans, such as the [Affordable Care Act](../a/affordable_care_act.md) (ACA) implementation.

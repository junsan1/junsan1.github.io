# Estate Tax

[Estate](../e/estate.md) tax, also known as the death tax or [inheritance tax](../i/inheritance_tax.md), is a tax on the transfer of the [estate](../e/estate.md) of a deceased person. The tax is levied on the net [value](../v/value.md) of the [estate](../e/estate.md), which includes all assets owned by the deceased, minus any liabilities and other allowable deductions. While [estate](../e/estate.md) tax laws and rates can vary significantly from one country to another, the fundamental principles surrounding the tax are largely consistent.

## Overview

[Estate](../e/estate.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) are typically imposed at both the federal and state levels, depending on the jurisdiction. In the United States, for instance, the federal [estate](../e/estate.md) tax only applies to estates that exceed a certain threshold. Similarly, some states have their own [estate](../e/estate.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) that may apply in addition to the federal tax. Executors of estates are responsible for calculating, reporting, and paying any [estate](../e/estate.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) due to the appropriate tax authorities.

## Federal Estate Tax in the United States

The federal [estate](../e/estate.md) tax in the United States is governed by the Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Code (IRC), which is administered by the Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Service (IRS). As of the most recent legislation, the [estate](../e/estate.md) tax applies only to estates exceeding $11.7 million for individuals and $23.4 million for married couples, due to the unified [credit](../c/credit.md) or [exemption](../e/exemption.md) amount.

### Calculation and Filing

1. **[Gross Estate](../g/gross_estate.md)**: This includes all property owned by the deceased at the time of death, such as [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, businesses, [personal property](../p/personal_property.md), and certain [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policies.
2. **Deductions**: The [gross estate](../g/gross_estate.md) is reduced by certain allowable deductions such as debts owed by the deceased, funeral expenses, charitable donations, and the marital [deduction](../d/deduction.md) (transfers to a surviving spouse).
3. **Taxable [Estate](../e/estate.md)**: The resultant [value](../v/value.md) after deductions is referred to as the taxable [estate](../e/estate.md).
4. **Tax Computation**: The federal [estate](../e/estate.md) tax rates are progressive, ranging from 18% to 40% on the taxable [estate](../e/estate.md) amount that exceeds the [exemption](../e/exemption.md) threshold.

The [executor](../e/executor.md) must file IRS [Form 706](../f/form_706.md), the United States [Estate](../e/estate.md) (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) [Tax Return](../t/tax_return.md), within nine months of the decedent’s death, although a six-month extension is available.

### Portability

Portability is a [provision](../p/provision.md) allowing a surviving spouse to use any unused portion of their deceased spouse’s [estate](../e/estate.md) tax [exemption](../e/exemption.md). For example, if one spouse dies and only uses $5 million of their $11.7 million [exemption](../e/exemption.md), the remaining $6.7 million can be transferred to the surviving spouse, giving them a larger [exemption](../e/exemption.md) when they pass away.

## Estate Taxes in Other Countries

### United Kingdom

In the UK, the equivalent of the [estate](../e/estate.md) tax is known as the [Inheritance Tax](../i/inheritance_tax.md) (IHT). The IHT threshold is £325,000 as of the latest policy, and assets above this amount are taxed at a rate of 40%. The IHT needs to be paid within six months of the person’s death, and the [executor](../e/executor.md) or administrator of the [estate](../e/estate.md) is responsible for ensuring compliance.

### Canada

Canada does not have an [estate](../e/estate.md) tax per se, but instead levies a deemed [disposition](../d/disposition.md) tax at death, where the deceased is considered to have sold all their assets at fair [market value](../m/market_value.md) immediately before death. This can result in [capital gains tax](../c/capital_gains_tax.md) being applied to the increase in [value](../v/value.md) of the assets since they were acquired.

## Historical Context and Policy Debates

[Estate](../e/estate.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) have been a contentious subject in public policy debates. Proponents argue that [estate](../e/estate.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) serve as a mechanism to prevent the excessive accumulation of [wealth](../w/wealth.md) in a few hands, thus promoting economic equality. Opponents contend that [estate](../e/estate.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) constitute [double taxation](../d/double_taxation.md) since the assets were already taxed when initially earned as [income](../i/income.md).

Throughout history, [estate](../e/estate.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) have undergone numerous changes. For instance, the [Economic Growth](../e/economic_growth.md) and [Tax Relief](../t/tax_relief.md) [Reconciliation](../r/reconciliation.md) Act of 2001 (EGTRRA) phased out the [estate](../e/estate.md) tax with a complete repeal scheduled for 2010, but the tax was reinstated in 2011 with new [exemption](../e/exemption.md) amounts and rates. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 further increased the [exemption](../e/exemption.md) thresholds.

## State Estate Taxes

Several states in the U.S. impose their own [estate](../e/estate.md) or inheritance [taxes](../t/taxes.md) alongside the federal tax. States like New York, New Jersey, and Maryland have their own [estate](../e/estate.md) tax systems with varying thresholds and rates. 

1. **New York**: As of the latest legislation, New York State imposes an [estate](../e/estate.md) tax on estates exceeding $5.93 million. The [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md) ranges between 3.06% and 16%, depending primarily on the size of the taxable [estate](../e/estate.md).
2. **New Jersey**: New Jersey abolished its [estate](../e/estate.md) tax in 2018 but still imposes an [inheritance tax](../i/inheritance_tax.md) applicable to certain classes of beneficiaries like non-lineal descendants and friends.
3. **Maryland**: Maryland is unique as it imposes both an [estate](../e/estate.md) tax and an [inheritance tax](../i/inheritance_tax.md). The [estate](../e/estate.md) tax applies to estates exceeding $5 million, while the [inheritance tax](../i/inheritance_tax.md) varies based on the [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md)’s relationship to the deceased.

## Planning and Strategies

Effective [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md) is essential to mitigate the impact of [estate](../e/estate.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md). Several strategies can be employed to minimize the taxable [value](../v/value.md) of an [estate](../e/estate.md):

1. **Gifting**: Transferring assets through gifting can reduce the size of the taxable [estate](../e/estate.md). In the U.S., individuals can gift up to $15,000 per recipient annually without triggering the [gift tax](../g/gift_tax.md).
2. **Trusts**: Establishing various types of trusts, such as irrevocable trusts, can shield assets from [estate](../e/estate.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md). Trusts can also provide for the [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of assets according to specified terms, potentially avoiding [probate](../p/probate.md).
3. **Charitable Donations**: Donating to charity through bequests can reduce the taxable [estate](../e/estate.md) [value](../v/value.md), considering donations are deductible.
4. **[Life Insurance](../l/life_insurance.md)**: Utilizing [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policies to provide [liquid](../l/liquid.md) assets to pay [estate](../e/estate.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) can ensure that other [estate](../e/estate.md) components are preserved for beneficiaries.

## Conclusion

[Estate](../e/estate.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) are a significant consideration for high-net-worth individuals and their families. Understanding the intricacies of [estate](../e/estate.md) tax laws and engaging in comprehensive [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md) can ensure that one's [wealth](../w/wealth.md), legacy, and financial stability are preserved across generations. With various tools and strategies available, careful planning can mitigate the potential tax burdens that come with the transfer of an [estate](../e/estate.md) upon death.

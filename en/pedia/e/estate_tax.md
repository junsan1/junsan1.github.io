# Estate Tax

Estate tax, also known as the death tax or inheritance tax, is a tax on the transfer of the estate of a deceased person. The tax is levied on the net value of the estate, which includes all assets owned by the deceased, minus any liabilities and other allowable deductions. While estate tax laws and rates can vary significantly from one country to another, the fundamental principles surrounding the tax are largely consistent.

## Overview

Estate taxes are typically imposed at both the federal and state levels, depending on the jurisdiction. In the United States, for instance, the federal estate tax only applies to estates that exceed a certain threshold. Similarly, some states have their own estate taxes that may apply in addition to the federal tax. Executors of estates are responsible for calculating, reporting, and paying any estate taxes due to the appropriate tax authorities.

## Federal Estate Tax in the United States

The federal estate tax in the United States is governed by the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), which is administered by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). As of the most recent legislation, the estate tax applies only to estates exceeding $11.7 million for individuals and $23.4 million for married couples, due to the unified credit or exemption amount.

### Calculation and Filing

1. **Gross Estate**: This includes all property owned by the deceased at the time of death, such as real estate, stocks, bonds, businesses, personal property, and certain life insurance policies.
2. **Deductions**: The gross estate is reduced by certain allowable deductions such as debts owed by the deceased, funeral expenses, charitable donations, and the marital deduction (transfers to a surviving spouse).
3. **Taxable Estate**: The resultant value after deductions is referred to as the taxable estate.
4. **Tax Computation**: The federal estate tax rates are progressive, ranging from 18% to 40% on the taxable estate amount that exceeds the exemption threshold.

The executor must file IRS Form 706, the United States Estate (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return, within nine months of the decedent’s death, although a six-month extension is available.

### Portability

Portability is a provision allowing a surviving spouse to use any unused portion of their deceased spouse’s estate tax exemption. For example, if one spouse dies and only uses $5 million of their $11.7 million exemption, the remaining $6.7 million can be transferred to the surviving spouse, giving them a larger exemption when they pass away.

## Estate Taxes in Other Countries

### United Kingdom

In the UK, the equivalent of the estate tax is known as the Inheritance Tax (IHT). The IHT threshold is £325,000 as of the latest policy, and assets above this amount are taxed at a rate of 40%. The IHT needs to be paid within six months of the person’s death, and the executor or administrator of the estate is responsible for ensuring compliance.

### Canada

Canada does not have an estate tax per se, but instead levies a deemed disposition tax at death, where the deceased is considered to have sold all their assets at fair market value immediately before death. This can result in capital gains tax being applied to the increase in value of the assets since they were acquired.

## Historical Context and Policy Debates

Estate taxes have been a contentious subject in public policy debates. Proponents argue that estate taxes serve as a mechanism to prevent the excessive accumulation of wealth in a few hands, thus promoting economic equality. Opponents contend that estate taxes constitute double taxation since the assets were already taxed when initially earned as income.

Throughout history, estate taxes have undergone numerous changes. For instance, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA) phased out the estate tax with a complete repeal scheduled for 2010, but the tax was reinstated in 2011 with new exemption amounts and rates. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 further increased the exemption thresholds.

## State Estate Taxes

Several states in the U.S. impose their own estate or inheritance taxes alongside the federal tax. States like New York, New Jersey, and Maryland have their own estate tax systems with varying thresholds and rates. 

1. **New York**: As of the latest legislation, New York State imposes an estate tax on estates exceeding $5.93 million. The tax rate ranges between 3.06% and 16%, depending primarily on the size of the taxable estate.
2. **New Jersey**: New Jersey abolished its estate tax in 2018 but still imposes an inheritance tax applicable to certain classes of beneficiaries like non-lineal descendants and friends.
3. **Maryland**: Maryland is unique as it imposes both an estate tax and an inheritance tax. The estate tax applies to estates exceeding $5 million, while the inheritance tax varies based on the beneficiary’s relationship to the deceased.

## Planning and Strategies

Effective estate planning is essential to mitigate the impact of estate taxes. Several strategies can be employed to minimize the taxable value of an estate:

1. **Gifting**: Transferring assets through gifting can reduce the size of the taxable estate. In the U.S., individuals can gift up to $15,000 per recipient annually without triggering the gift tax.
2. **Trusts**: Establishing various types of trusts, such as irrevocable trusts, can shield assets from estate taxes. Trusts can also provide for the distribution of assets according to specified terms, potentially avoiding probate.
3. **Charitable Donations**: Donating to charity through bequests can reduce the taxable estate value, considering donations are deductible.
4. **Life Insurance**: Utilizing life insurance policies to provide liquid assets to pay estate taxes can ensure that other estate components are preserved for beneficiaries.

## Conclusion

Estate taxes are a significant consideration for high-net-worth individuals and their families. Understanding the intricacies of estate tax laws and engaging in comprehensive estate planning can ensure that one's wealth, legacy, and financial stability are preserved across generations. With various tools and strategies available, careful planning can mitigate the potential tax burdens that come with the transfer of an estate upon death.

# Ethereum

## Introduction to Ethereum

Ethereum is a decentralized, [open](../o/open.md)-source [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) platform that enables developers to build and deploy [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md) and decentralized applications (DApps). Unlike [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md), which was designed primarily as a [digital currency](../d/digital_currency.md), Ethereum's purpose is to provide a [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) with a fully functional Turing-complete programming language. This allows anyone to write [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md) and decentralized applications where they can create their own rules, assets, and functionality.

The platform was proposed in late 2013 by a developer named [Vitalik Buterin](../v/vitalik_buterin.md) and development began in early 2014 through a Swiss company, Ethereum Switzerland GmbH (EthSuisse). Ethereum's development was crowdfunded in an online public [sale](../s/sale.md) during the summer of 2014, and the network went live on July 30, 2015.

## Key Components of Ethereum

### Ether (ETH)

Ether (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum platform. It acts as the fuel for operating the distributed application platform of Ethereum. It's used to pay for [transaction fees](../t/transaction_fees.md) and computational services on the Ethereum network. Developers need to pay in Ether to deploy and execute their applications or contracts.

### Smart Contracts

[Smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md) are self-executing contracts where the terms of the agreement or conditions are directly written into code. They automatically enact and enforce the terms when predetermined conditions are met, eliminating the need for a middleman.

### Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the runtime environment for [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md) in Ethereum. It is Turing-complete, meaning it can run any program, given enough resources. The EVM runs hundreds of thousands of decentralized applications.

### Decentralized Applications (DApps)

DApps are applications that run on a P2P network of computers rather than a single computer. They are decentralized because no single entity has control over the entire application. A DApp has its backend code running on a decentralized network (like Ethereum) and its frontend stored on a [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md).

## How Ethereum Works

Ethereum operates through a combination of key technologies and concepts that provide the foundation for its decentralized network:

### Blockchain

Ethereum's [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) is similar in structure to [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md)’s—the data is stored in a continuously growing list of records called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic [hash](../h/hash.md) of the previous block, a timestamp, and [transaction](../t/transaction.md) data.

### Proof of Stake (PoS)

Ethereum is transitioning from a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to Proof of Stake (PoS) with Ethereum 2.0, also known as Eth2 or Serenity. PoS is intended to be more efficient and environmentally sustainable as it reduces the reliance on energy-intensive [mining](../m/mining.md) processes.

### Gas and Gas Limit

Gas is the unit that measures the amount of computational effort required to execute operations, such as transactions or smart contract functionality. The gas limit is a user-defined [value](../v/value.md) that sets the upper bound for how much computational work the user is willing to spend on a [transaction](../t/transaction.md).

### Nodes and Mining

Ethereum nodes are computers taking part in the Ethereum network. Some nodes are miners—these nodes apply the Proof of Work algorithm to validate transactions and, subsequently, add new blocks to the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md). With the move to Ethereum 2.0, the network [will](../w/will.md) shift to validator nodes that lock up a certain amount of ETH to participate in PoS.

## Use Cases of Ethereum

### Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

DeFi is one of the most popular use cases of Ethereum. It includes financial applications built on [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technologies, typically using [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md). These applications aim to recreate traditional financial systems such as loans, [insurance](../i/insurance.md), and trading but in a decentralized manner. Examples include Uniswap (a decentralized [exchange](../e/exchange.md)), MakerDAO (a decentralized lending platform), and Compound (a decentralized [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) protocol).

### Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)

NFTs are unique digital assets representing ownership or proof of authenticity of specific items, usually digital art, music, or collectibles. Ethereum's ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards are the most commonly used standards for NFTs. Platforms like OpenSea and Rarible are built on Ethereum and facilitate the creation, buying, and selling of NFTs.

### Enterprise Applications

Ethereum has also found a [home](../h/home.md) in enterprises, where it is used for private [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) solutions. Companies like ConsenSys (https://consensys.net/) provide enterprise-grade solutions leveraging Ethereum to improve [business](../b/business.md) processes in industries like [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md), healthcare, and [finance](../f/finance.md).

### Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs)

Ethereum's [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md) enabled the rise of ICOs, a new form of [crowdfunding](../c/crowdfunding.md) in which startups could raise [capital](../c/capital.md) by issuing their own tokens. Thousands of projects have raised millions of dollars through ICOs, using Ethereum's platform.

## Ethereum 2.0 (Eth2)

Ethereum 2.0 is a multi-phased [upgrade](../u/upgrade.md) aimed at improving the [scalability](../s/scalability.md), [security](../s/security.md), and sustainability of Ethereum. Key elements include the transition from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake and the introduction of shard chains:

### Beacon Chain

Launched in December 2020, the Beacon Chain introduces the Proof of Stake mechanism to the Ethereum ecosystem. It runs parallel to Ethereum's mainnet and [will](../w/will.md) eventually merge with it.

### Shard Chains

Shard chains [will](../w/will.md) expand Ethereum's capacity to process transactions and store data. Instead of processing every [transaction](../t/transaction.md) on a single [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md), the workload is distributed across 64 new chains.

### The Merge

The Merge refers to the upcoming integration of the current Ethereum mainnet with the Beacon Chain, marking Ethereum’s complete shift to PoS. This is anticipated to occur sometime in 2022-2023.

## Challenges and Criticisms

Ethereum, despite its success, faces several challenges and criticisms:

### Scalability

Ethereum currently faces issues with [scalability](../s/scalability.md), leading to high gas fees and slower [transaction](../t/transaction.md) times. This is particularly evident during periods of network congestion.

### Environmental Concerns

While Ethereum is moving to Proof of Stake, its current Proof of Work mechanism is criticized for its environmental impact due to high energy consumption.

### Security

As with any technology, Ethereum is not immune to [security](../s/security.md) vulnerabilities. Successful attacks on [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md) are not uncommon and raise concerns about the platform’s overall [security](../s/security.md).

### Centralization Risks

There are concerns about centralization risks associated with staking in Ethereum 2.0, where large holders of ETH could exert significant control over the network.

## Concluding Thoughts

Ethereum has played a pivotal role in the development of the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) and cryptocurrency [industry](../i/industry.md). By providing a flexible and [robust](../r/robust.md) platform for [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md) and decentralized applications, Ethereum has opened up a world of possibilities beyond digital currencies. As it continues to evolve with Ethereum 2.0, it aims to address its [scalability](../s/scalability.md) and environmental concerns, positioning itself for further growth and innovation in the years to come.

# Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)

The Economic [Order](../o/order.md) Quantity (EOQ) is a critical formula and concept in [inventory management](../i/inventory_management.md) and operations. It aims to identify the ideal [order](../o/order.md) quantity a company should purchase to minimize its [inventory](../i/inventory.md) costs, including [holding costs](../h/holding_costs.md), shortage costs, and [order](../o/order.md) costs. The EOQ model helps in optimizing the [logistics](../l/logistics.md) and stock replenishment strategy to enhance a company's [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and profitability.

## What is Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)?

At its core, EOQ is the [order](../o/order.md) quantity that minimizes the total [holding costs](../h/holding_costs.md) and ordering costs. It is a balancing act that ensures a company orders enough [inventory](../i/inventory.md) to meet [customer](../c/customer.md) [demand](../d/demand.md) without overpaying for [inventory](../i/inventory.md) or storage. Specifically, it strives to strike a balance between two key opposing costs: the cost of ordering and the cost of holding [inventory](../i/inventory.md).

### Components of EOQ
- **[Holding Costs](../h/holding_costs.md)**: These are costs associated with storing [inventory](../i/inventory.md) over a period. This includes [warehousing](../w/warehousing.md) costs, [insurance](../i/insurance.md), [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md), obsolescence, and other costs tied to keeping [inventory](../i/inventory.md).
- **Ordering Costs**: These relate to the costs of placing orders. This includes administrative and paperwork costs, resource costs, shipping costs, and inspection costs associated with receiving and storing new [inventory](../i/inventory.md).
- **Shortage Costs**: These are costs incurred when the [demand](../d/demand.md) exceeds the [supply](../s/supply.md) of [inventory](../i/inventory.md) on hand. This could include lost sales, [backorder](../b/backorder.md) costs, and loss of [customer](../c/customer.md) [goodwill](../g/goodwill.md).

## EOQ Formula

The classical EOQ formula is derived from these components and is calculated as:

\[ EOQ = \sqrt{\frac{2DS}{H}} \]

Where:
- \( D \) is the annual [demand](../d/demand.md) (units per year).
- \( S \) is the [order](../o/order.md) cost (cost per [order](../o/order.md)).
- \( H \) is the holding cost (cost per unit per year).

### Breakdown of the Formula:
- **Annual [Demand](../d/demand.md) (\(D\))**: Refers to the expected total quantity of units required over one year.
- **[Order](../o/order.md) Cost (\(S\))**: Costs incurred for each [order](../o/order.md) placed, regardless of the number of units ordered.
- **Holding Cost (\(H\))**: Costs for keeping one unit of [inventory](../i/inventory.md) in storage for one year.

By applying the EOQ formula, businesses can determine the optimal number of units to [order](../o/order.md), minimizing total [inventory](../i/inventory.md) costs.

## Assumptions of the EOQ Model

EOQ calculations are based on several assumptions:
- **[Demand](../d/demand.md) is constant and known**: The [demand](../d/demand.md) for the product remains steady over time and can be predicted accurately.
- **[Lead Time](../l/lead_time.md) is constant and known**: The time between placing an [order](../o/order.md) and receiving it is predictable and does not vary.
- **[Holding Costs](../h/holding_costs.md), Ordering Costs, and Unit Prices are constant**: These costs do not fluctuate over time.
- **No Stockouts**: The [firm](../f/firm.md) never runs out of stock, meaning every [order](../o/order.md) is timed perfectly to meet [demand](../d/demand.md).
  
These assumptions are often criticized as being too simplistic for many real-world scenarios, but they provide a foundational model that can be adjusted as needed.

## Extensions and Variations of the EOQ Model

In practice, the basic EOQ model might not always fit due to [variability](../v/variability.md) in [demand](../d/demand.md), lead times, and costs. Therefore, several extensions and variations exist:

- **Economic Production Quantity (EPQ)**: A variation of EOQ, this model is used for production instead of ordering.
  
- **Quantity Discounts**: EOQ variations that incorporate bulk purchase discounts.
  
- **Backordering**: Adjusted EOQ calculations that take into account scenarios where backordering of items is allowed.
  
- **Stochastic EOQ Models**: These models account for randomness in [demand](../d/demand.md) or [lead time](../l/lead_time.md).

## Application of EOQ in Inventory Management

Implementing an EOQ model requires accurate input data and periodic review to ensure assumptions still [hold](../h/hold.md). Here’s how it typically works within a [business](../b/business.md) framework:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather data on [demand](../d/demand.md), ordering costs, and [holding costs](../h/holding_costs.md).
2. **EOQ Calculation**: Utilize the EOQ formula to determine the optimal [order](../o/order.md) size.
3. **Review**: Regularly review and update inputs as [market](../m/market.md) conditions, costs, and demands change.
4. **Monitoring and Adjusting**: Monitor [inventory](../i/inventory.md) levels and adjust orders based on real-time data to reflect variations in [demand](../d/demand.md) and other factors.

## Real-World Example: Walmart

To grasp how EOQ is applied in a large enterprise, consider Walmart, a retail giant recognized for its [logistics](../l/logistics.md) and [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md) [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md). Walmart utilizes EOQ models to maintain optimal stock levels across its numerous stores. Their complex [inventory](../i/inventory.md) strategies go beyond the basic EOQ model, incorporating advanced software and real-time [data analytics](../d/data_analytics.md) to ensure shelves are stocked with minimal waste and cost. More details on Walmart’s [inventory management](../i/inventory_management.md) can be found on their official site: [Walmart](https://corporate.walmart.com).

## Advantages of EOQ

- **Cost Management**: Effectively balances [order](../o/order.md) and [holding costs](../h/holding_costs.md) to minimize total [inventory](../i/inventory.md) costs.
- **Simplicity**: Provides a straightforward method for determining optimal [order](../o/order.md) quantities.
- **[Inventory](../i/inventory.md) Control**: Helps in maintaining a consistent and reliable [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md).
  
## Limitations of EOQ

- **Simplistic Assumptions**: Real-life [supply](../s/supply.md) chains often face fluctuating [demand](../d/demand.md), variable lead times, and changing costs, which EOQ might not account for.
- **Static Nature**: Not adaptable in highly dynamic environments where constant recalculations might be necessary.
- **Ignores Stockout Costs**: Standard EOQ focuses mainly on holding and ordering costs without factoring in the potential impact of stockouts.

## Conclusion

The Economic [Order](../o/order.md) Quantity (EOQ) is a foundational concept in [inventory management](../i/inventory_management.md), helping businesses determine the optimal [order](../o/order.md) size that minimizes total [inventory](../i/inventory.md) costs. Despite some limitations and assumptions, EOQ remains a crucial tool for enterprises aiming to streamline their [supply](../s/supply.md) chains. By integrating EOQ into broader [inventory](../i/inventory.md) and operations strategies, companies can achieve significant cost efficiencies and maintain a [robust](../r/robust.md) [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md).

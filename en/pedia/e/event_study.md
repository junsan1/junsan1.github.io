# Event Study

## Introduction

An event study is a powerful [empirical analysis](../e/empirical_analysis_in_trading.md) method used primarily in the financial realm to assess the impact of a specific event on the [value](../v/value.md) of a [firm](../f/firm.md). Events can [range](../r/range.md) from [earnings announcements](../e/earnings_announcements.md), mergers and acquisitions, regulatory changes, to macroeconomic news, among others. The primary goal of an event study is to determine whether there is an [abnormal return](../a/abnormal_return.md) around the time of the event, thus providing insight into how investors perceive the information conveyed by the event.

## Key Concepts and Methodology

### Abnormal Returns

Abnormal returns are returns that differ from the expected returns based on some model. In an event study, the [abnormal return](../a/abnormal_return.md) is the difference between the actual [return](../r/return.md) and the normal, or expected, [return](../r/return.md) estimated over a certain period. The formula for abnormal returns is generally stated as:

```
AR_it = R_it - E(R_it)
```

where:
- `AR_it` is the [abnormal return](../a/abnormal_return.md) for stock i at time t.
- `R_it` is the actual [return](../r/return.md) for stock i at time t.
- `E(R_it)` is the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) for stock i at time t.

### Event Window and Estimation Window

The event window is the period over which the event's impact is assessed. This window is usually centered around the event date, but it can vary in length depending on the nature of the event and the researcher’s [interest](../i/interest.md).

The estimation window is a period before the event window and is used to estimate the normal performance of the [security](../s/security.md). The returns during this period are used to generate the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) model, which could be based on various [asset pricing models](../a/asset_pricing_models.md) such as the [Market](../m/market.md) Model, CAPM, or others.

### Cumulative Abnormal Returns (CAR) and Average Abnormal Returns (AAR)

To assess the overall impact of an event over a period, researchers often compute the cumulative abnormal returns (CAR). The CAR aggregates the abnormal returns over the event window. The average [abnormal return](../a/abnormal_return.md) (AAR) across [multiple](../m/multiple.md) events or securities is also used for robustness, [offering](../o/offering.md) a more generalized view.

The formulas are typically as follows:

```
CAR_i(t_1, t_2) = Σ AR_it from t=t1 to t=t2
AAR_t = (1/N) Σ AR_it from i=1 to N
```

where:
- `CAR_i(t_1, t_2)` is the cumulative [abnormal return](../a/abnormal_return.md) for [security](../s/security.md) i from time t1 to t2.
- `AAR_t` is the average [abnormal return](../a/abnormal_return.md) at time t.
- N is the number of events or securities.

## Steps in Conducting an Event Study

1. **Event Identification**: Identify the event of [interest](../i/interest.md) and determine the event date.
2. **Selection of Firms**: Choose the sample of firms or securities affected by the event.
3. **Estimation Window**: Define the estimation window to calculate the expected returns.
4. **Event Window**: Specify the event window to assess the impact.
5. **Model Selection**: Select a model to estimate expected returns (e.g., [Market](../m/market.md) Model, CAPM).
6. **Estimation of Expected Returns**: Estimate the expected returns using data from the estimation window.
7. **Calculation of Abnormal Returns**: Calculate the abnormal returns during the event window.
8. **Statistical Testing**: Use statistical tests to determine the significance of abnormal returns.

## Models for Expected Return Estimation

### The Market Model

The [Market](../m/market.md) Model is one of the most commonly used models in event studies. It is based on the [linear relationship](../l/linear_relationship.md) between the securities' returns and the [market](../m/market.md)'s returns.

```
R_it = α_i + β_i R_mt + ε_it
```

where:
- `R_it` is the [return](../r/return.md) on [security](../s/security.md) i at time t.
- `R_mt` is the [return](../r/return.md) on the [market portfolio](../m/market_portfolio.md) at time t.
- `α_i` and `β_i` are parameters estimated over the estimation window.
- `ε_it` is the [error term](../e/error_term.md).

### Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

The CAPM model provides another [robust](../r/robust.md) method for estimating expected returns, incorporating the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate along with [market risk](../m/market_risk.md).

```
E(R_it) = R_f + β_i (R_mt - R_f)
```

where:
- `R_f` is the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate.
- Other terms are as previously defined.

## Applications of Event Studies

Event studies are used widely in both academic research and by practitioners to analyze various events:

- **[Earnings Announcements](../e/earnings_announcements.md)**: To understand [market](../m/market.md) reactions to [earnings surprises](../e/earnings_surprises.md).
- **Mergers and Acquisitions**: To evaluate the impact of [merger](../m/merger.md) announcements on stock prices of the acquiring and target firms.
- **Policy Changes**: To examine how regulatory changes affect stock prices.
- **Corporate Actions**: To assess the impact of stock splits, [dividend](../d/dividend.md) announcements, and share repurchases.
- **Macroeconomic Announcements**: To understand [market](../m/market.md) responses to changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, GDP announcements, or [inflation](../i/inflation.md) data.

## Statistical Tests in Event Studies

Various statistical tests are used to evaluate the significance of abnormal returns:

- **Student's [t-Test](../t/t-test.md)**: Often used to test whether the abnormal returns are significantly different from zero.
- **Parametric Tests**: Includes tests assuming a [normal distribution](../n/normal_distribution_in_trading.md) of abnormal returns.
- **Non-Parametric Tests**: Includes tests like the Sign Test or Rank Test, which do not assume any specific [distribution](../d/distribution.md) for abnormal returns.

## Case Study: Analyzing the Impact of a Merger Announcement

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Event Identification**: Identify a major [merger](../m/merger.md) announcement and the announcement date.
2. **Sample Selection**: Select the acquiring and target firms.
3. **Estimation Window**: Choose an estimation window of, say, 120 days prior to the event.
4. **Event Window**: Choose an event window of [-10, +10] days surrounding the event date.
5. **Model Selection**: Use the [Market](../m/market.md) Model for [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) estimation.
6. **Data Collection**: Gather historical stock price data and [market index](../m/market_index.md) data.
7. **Estimation**: Estimate the [Market](../m/market.md) Model parameters using data from the estimation window.
8. **Calculation**: Compute abnormal returns and cumulative abnormal returns.
9. **Testing**: Conduct statistical tests to determine the significance of abnormal returns.

### Results Interpretation

Analyze the CAR and statistical test results to conclude whether the [merger](../m/merger.md) announcement had a significant impact on the stock prices of the acquiring and target firms.

## Conclusion

Event studies are a cornerstone of empirical [finance](../f/finance.md) and provide [robust](../r/robust.md) tools to assess the impact of various events on [security](../s/security.md) prices. With a well-defined methodology, selection of appropriate models, and use of contemporary tools, researchers and practitioners can derive significant insights into [market](../m/market.md) behaviors and [investor](../i/investor.md) reactions.

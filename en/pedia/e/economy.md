# Economy

## Definition
The **Economy** refers to the system by which goods and services are produced, distributed, and consumed within a society or geographic area. It encompasses all activities related to the production and exchange of goods and services, including the roles of individuals, businesses, and governments.

## Key Components
1. **Production**: The process of creating goods and services. This includes the use of labor, capital, and natural resources.
2. **Distribution**: The allocation of produced goods and services to different members of society. This can involve markets, trade, and logistics.
3. **Consumption**: The use of goods and services by individuals and businesses. Consumption drives demand and influences production.

## Types of Economies
1. **Market Economy**: An economic system where supply and demand determine the prices of goods and services. Private individuals and businesses make most economic decisions. Examples include the United States and most of Europe.
2. **Command Economy**: An economic system where the government makes all economic decisions, including what to produce, how to produce it, and for whom. Examples include North Korea and the former Soviet Union.
3. **Mixed Economy**: A combination of market and command economies. The government and private sector both play significant roles in economic decision-making. Examples include China and India.
4. **Traditional Economy**: An economic system based on customs, history, and time-honored beliefs. Production and distribution are often based on kinship, religion, and social order. Examples include rural parts of Africa and South America.

## Economic Indicators
1. **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)**: The total value of all goods and services produced within a country over a specific period. It is a key indicator of economic performance.

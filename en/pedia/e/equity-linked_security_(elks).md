# Equity-Linked Security (ELKS)

[Equity](../e/equity.md)-Linked Securities (ELKS) are a type of [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) that combines features of both [debt](../d/debt.md) and [equity](../e/equity.md). These hybrid securities [offer](../o/offer.md) investors the opportunity to participate in the potential [upside](../u/upside.md) of a specific stock or [equity](../e/equity.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md), while providing a degree of [capital](../c/capital.md) protection or [income](../i/income.md) generation. They are particularly appealing to investors seeking exposure to [equity](../e/equity.md) markets with a lower [risk](../r/risk.md) profile.

## Key Features of ELKS

### Structure

ELKS typically have a fixed term, which can vary but commonly ranges from one to five years. They are issued by financial institutions such as banks and investment firms. The [value](../v/value.md) of an ELKS is linked to the performance of a specific [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), usually a single stock or an [equity](../e/equity.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md).

### Principal Protection

One of the primary features of ELKS is [principal](../p/principal.md) protection, either partial or full. This means that at [maturity](../m/maturity.md), the [investor](../i/investor.md) is guaranteed to receive a predefined percentage of their initial investment, regardless of the performance of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). Full [principal](../p/principal.md) protection ensures the [return](../r/return.md) of the entire initial investment, while partial protection may guarantee a certain percentage, such as 90%.

### Income Generation

ELKS often come with periodic [interest](../i/interest.md) or coupon payments, which provide a stream of [income](../i/income.md) to the [investor](../i/investor.md). The [yield](../y/yield.md) on these payments can vary and may be higher than that of traditional fixed-[income](../i/income.md) securities, reflecting the embedded [equity](../e/equity.md) [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Upside Potential

Unlike traditional [debt](../d/debt.md) instruments, ELKS allow investors to participate in the potential appreciation of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [equity](../e/equity.md). If the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock or [index](../i/index_instrument.md) surpasses a certain threshold, known as the [participation rate](../p/participation_rate.md) or cap, the [investor](../i/investor.md) receives additional returns based on the performance of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

### Downside Risk

The [downside risk](../d/downside_risk.md) of ELKS is generally limited to the level of [principal](../p/principal.md) protection. For instance, if the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) performs poorly, and the ELKS includes partial protection, the [investor](../i/investor.md) could lose a portion of their initial investment. However, the loss is typically less severe compared to [direct investment](../d/direct_investment.md) in the [equity](../e/equity.md).

## Advantages of ELKS

### Risk Mitigation

ELKS [offer](../o/offer.md) a way to mitigate [risk](../r/risk.md) by providing a level of [principal](../p/principal.md) protection. This can be particularly appealing during volatile [market](../m/market.md) conditions or for conservative investors seeking exposure to equities without taking on full [market risk](../m/market_risk.md).

### Diversification

As hybrid instruments, ELKS [offer](../o/offer.md) a blend of fixed-[income](../i/income.md) and [equity](../e/equity.md) exposure. This unique combination can enhance [portfolio diversification](../p/portfolio_diversification.md) and potentially improve [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted returns.

### Customization

ELKS can be tailored to meet various [investor](../i/investor.md) needs. Issuers can structure these instruments with different levels of [principal](../p/principal.md) protection, [maturity](../m/maturity.md) terms, and [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets. This flexibility allows investors to select ELKS that align with their investment goals and [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md).

## Disadvantages of ELKS

### Complexity

The structured nature of ELKS can be complex, making them difficult for some investors to fully understand. The terms and conditions, including the calculation of returns and the specifics of [principal](../p/principal.md) protection, require careful analysis.

### Limited Liquidity

ELKS are typically less [liquid](../l/liquid.md) than traditional [stocks](../s/stock.md) or bonds. They are often not [listed](../l/listed.md) on major exchanges, and [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md) trading can be limited. This lack of [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) can make it challenging to sell ELKS before [maturity](../m/maturity.md).

### Potential for Lower Returns

While ELKS provide downside protection, the [trade](../t/trade.md)-off can be lower potential returns compared to direct [equity](../e/equity.md) investments. The [participation rate](../p/participation_rate.md) or cap on [upside potential](../u/upside_potential_in_trading.md) may limit the gains an [investor](../i/investor.md) can realize if the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) performs exceptionally well.

## Use Cases of ELKS

### Income-Focused Investors

Investors seeking regular [income](../i/income.md) with some exposure to [equity](../e/equity.md) markets may find ELKS attractive. The periodic coupon payments provide a steady [income](../i/income.md) stream, while the [principal](../p/principal.md) protection feature reduces the [risk](../r/risk.md) of significant [capital](../c/capital.md) loss.

### Conservative Investors

ELKS are suitable for conservative investors who want to participate in [equity](../e/equity.md) markets but are wary of the associated risks. The [principal](../p/principal.md) protection element ensures that they do not lose their entire investment, providing a cushion against [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

### Strategic Asset Allocation

Financial advisors and portfolio managers can use ELKS as a strategic tool for [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md). By incorporating ELKS, they can balance the need for [income](../i/income.md) generation, [risk](../r/risk.md) mitigation, and [equity](../e/equity.md) exposure in client portfolios.

## Market Examples and Issuers of ELKS

Several financial institutions are known for issuing ELKS, providing a [range](../r/range.md) of products tailored to different [investor](../i/investor.md) needs. Examples include:

## Regulatory Environment

ELKS are typically subject to regulation by financial authorities in the jurisdictions where they are issued and sold. In the United States, for example, they must comply with the [Securities Act of 1933](../s/securities_act_of_1933.md) and the [Securities Exchange Act of 1934](../s/securities_exchange_act_of_1934.md). Issuers must provide detailed [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) documents, including the terms and conditions of the ELKS, the risks involved, and the calculation methodologies for returns and [principal](../p/principal.md) protection.

## Conclusion

[Equity](../e/equity.md)-Linked Securities (ELKS) represent a sophisticated investment tool that bridges the gap between traditional fixed-[income](../i/income.md) instruments and equities. By [offering](../o/offering.md) [principal](../p/principal.md) protection, [income](../i/income.md) generation, and the potential for [upside](../u/upside.md) participation, they appeal to a wide [range](../r/range.md) of investors, from conservative to [income](../i/income.md)-focused and strategic portfolio managers. However, the complexity, potential for lower returns, and limited [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) necessitate thorough understanding and careful consideration before investment.

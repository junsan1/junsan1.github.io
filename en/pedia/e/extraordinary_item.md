# Extraordinary Items

## Overview

Extraordinary items (also known as non-recurring items) refer to atypical gains or losses in [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) that are not expected to happen regularly. These items are significant because they affect a company’s net [income](../i/income.md) and must be disclosed separately to give a true picture of the ongoing [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and performance of the company. Understanding extraordinary items is essential for [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), as it helps in more accurate [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md) and better trading decisions.

## Definition

In [accounting](../a/accounting.md), extraordinary items are non-recurring gains or losses that are distinguished from the regular operational profits or losses of a company. They are unusual and infrequent, and their inclusion in financial reports is essential for analysts and investors to make informed decisions. Common examples of extraordinary items include:

- Natural disasters that cause loss or damage to company assets.
- Legal settlements that result in substantial payouts.
- Significant [restructuring](../r/restructuring.md) expenses.
- [Discontinued operations](../d/discontinued_operations.md).

## Characteristics of Extraordinary Items

To qualify as an extraordinary item, the event must meet specific criteria:

### Unusual Nature

The event must be highly abnormal and unrelated to, or only incidentally related to, the ordinary and typical activities of the company. For instance, a car manufacturer experiencing losses due to a factory fire could constitute an extraordinary item.

### Infrequency of Occurrence

The event must not be expected to recur in the foreseeable future. For example, a company may only rarely have to pay a legal settlement or incur a loss from a natural disaster.

## Impact on Financial Statements

### Income Statement

Extraordinary items are typically shown separately on the [income statement](../i/income_statement.md), net of [taxes](../t/taxes.md), to provide a clear picture of the company’s regular operational performance. This separation allows investors and analysts to differentiate between ordinary [business](../b/business.md) items and anomalies that are not indicative of the company’s normal performance.

### Earnings Per Share (EPS)

Extraordinary items can affect the calculation of EPS. When presenting EPS, companies usually exclude these items to show the performance without the [noise](../n/noise.md) created by such one-time events.

## Accounting Standards and Extraneous Items

Different [accounting](../a/accounting.md) standards bodies, like the [Financial Accounting](../f/financial_accounting.md) Standards Board (FASB) and the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), have taken distinct approaches toward extraordinary items:

### FASB

In 2015, the FASB issued an update ([Accounting](../a/accounting.md) Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-01) eliminating the requirement to separately present extraordinary items in the [income statement](../i/income_statement.md). This move aimed to simplify [income statement](../i/income_statement.md) presentation and reduce the subjectivity involved in identifying extraordinary items.

### IFRS

Under IFRS, companies are not allowed to present any item as being extraordinary. Instead, companies disclose the nature and amounts of significant items that may affect the comparability of the [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md).

## Importance in Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) involves using computer programs to [trade](../t/trade.md) financial securities based on predetermined criteria. Analyzing extraordinary items is crucial for several reasons:

### Market Sentiment Analysis

Extraordinary items can greatly influence [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md). For instance, a significant loss due to a natural disaster may lead to a decline in stock prices. [Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) models can be designed to detect such anomalies and adjust [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) accordingly.

### Financial Health Assessment

By understanding extraordinary items, [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) algorithms can better assess the [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) of companies. This assessment is used in [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md) to forecast future performance and make buy or sell decisions.

### Risk Management

[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) systems can incorporate the analysis of extraordinary items to manage [risk](../r/risk.md) more effectively. By recognizing and responding to these one-time events, traders can mitigate the adverse effects on their portfolios.

## Practical Applications in Algo Trading

### Data Scraping and Updates

Modern financial algorithms often incorporate real-time data scraping from financial news agencies, company press releases, and other sources. These algorithms can flag extraordinary items and adjust [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) almost instantaneously.

### Regression Models

Regression models used in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) for stock price prediction can be adjusted to exclude the effects of extraordinary items. This exclusion ensures a more accurate prediction by focusing on recurring [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md).

### Machine Learning

[Machine learning algorithms](../m/machine_learning_algorithms_in_trading.md) can be trained to identify the likelihood of extraordinary items based on historical data and specific [market](../m/market.md) conditions. This predictive capability allows for more proactive [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

## Conclusion

Understanding extraordinary items is an integral part of [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md) in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md). By recognizing and appropriately reacting to these non-recurring events, traders can make more informed decisions, better assess the [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) of companies, and manage [risk](../r/risk.md) more effectively. As the field of algo trading continues to evolve, the ability to analyze and adapt to extraordinary items [will](../w/will.md) remain a critical component of a successful [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md).

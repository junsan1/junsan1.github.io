# EAFE Index

The EAFE Index, or the MSCI EAFE Index, stands for the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) Europe, Australasia, and Far East Index. It is a stock market index that is designed to measure the equity market performance of developed markets outside the U.S. and Canada. The EAFE Index has been a key benchmark for international equity funds since its inception in 1969 by the financial services company MSCI Inc.

## Components and Structure

### Regional Segmentation
The MSCI EAFE Index encompasses three main geographical areas: Europe, Australasia, and the Far East. Each region contributes a varying percentage of the total index value:
- **Europe**: The majority of countries included are from Europe. This includes major economies like the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and the Netherlands.
- **Australasia**: Includes Australia and New Zealand, representing the developed markets in the southern hemisphere.
- **Far East**: Encompasses key nations such as Japan and Hong Kong, which are prominent financial hubs in Asia.

### Sector Allocation
The MSCI EAFE Index covers multiple sectors including but not limited to financials, information technology, health care, consumer discretionary, and industrials. The sector allocation aims to diversify the index and represent the broader market trends in each of the included countries.

## Importance of the EAFE Index

### Benchmarking for International Funds
The EAFE Index is commonly used as a benchmark for international equity funds. Investment managers and institutional investors refer to it to gauge their performance relative to the broader international market.

### Risk Diversification
For U.S.-centric portfolios, the EAFE Index offers exposure to international markets, thereby providing an essential diversification benefit. This diversification can help mitigate risks associated with country-specific economic downturns and geopolitical issues.

### Strategic Asset Allocation
The EAFE Index assists in strategic asset allocation decisions. Investors utilize the index to achieve a balanced investment approach by including international equities, which can lead to better risk-adjusted returns over the long term.

## Methodology

### Market Capitalization
The EAFE Index is weighted by market capitalization, reflecting the total market value of the companies included within the index. This means that larger companies have a more significant impact on the index movements.

### Free Float Adjustment
MSCI uses a free float-adjusted market capitalization methodology. The free float adjustment accounts for only the shares that are available for public trading, excluding strategic shares held by insiders or governments.

### Rebalancing
The index is reviewed quarterly in February, May, August, and November. During these reviews, MSCI may adjust the weightings of existing components or include/exclude certain stocks to ensure the index accurately reflects the international equity market.

## Risks and Considerations

### Currency Risk
As the EAFE Index includes stocks from multiple countries, currency fluctuations can impact returns. Investors are exposed to currency risk, which is the risk of losing value due to changes in currency exchange rates.

### Market Risk
Economic or political instability in any of the EAFE Index countries can lead to market risk. For instance, Brexit significantly impacted the European segment of the index, causing fluctuations based on investor sentiment and economic consequences.

### Regulatory Differences
Different regulatory environments across the included countries may result in varied levels of transparency and governance. Investors must consider these regulatory differences when using the EAFE Index as part of their investment strategy.

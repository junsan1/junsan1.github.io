# EAFE Index

The EAFE [Index](../i/index_instrument.md), or the MSCI EAFE [Index](../i/index_instrument.md), stands for the Morgan Stanley [Capital](../c/capital.md) International (MSCI) Europe, Australasia, and Far East [Index](../i/index_instrument.md). It is a stock [market index](../m/market_index.md) that is designed to measure the [equity market](../e/equity_market.md) performance of developed markets outside the U.S. and Canada. The EAFE [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) has been a key [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for international [equity](../e/equity.md) funds since its inception in 1969 by the financial services company MSCI Inc.

## Components and Structure

### Regional Segmentation
The MSCI EAFE [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) encompasses three main geographical areas: Europe, Australasia, and the Far East. Each region contributes a varying percentage of the total [index](../i/index_instrument.md) [value](../v/value.md):
- **Europe**: The majority of countries included are from Europe. This includes major economies like the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and the Netherlands.
- **Australasia**: Includes Australia and New Zealand, representing the developed markets in the southern hemisphere.
- **Far East**: Encompasses key nations such as Japan and Hong Kong, which are prominent financial hubs in Asia.

### Sector Allocation
The MSCI EAFE [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) covers [multiple](../m/multiple.md) sectors including but not limited to financials, information technology, health care, consumer discretionary, and industrials. The sector allocation aims to diversify the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) and represent the broader [market](../m/market.md) trends in each of the included countries.

## Importance of the EAFE Index

### Benchmarking for International Funds
The EAFE [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) is commonly used as a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for international [equity](../e/equity.md) funds. Investment managers and institutional investors refer to it to gauge their performance relative to the broader international [market](../m/market.md).

### Risk Diversification
For U.S.-centric portfolios, the EAFE [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) offers exposure to international markets, thereby providing an essential [diversification](../d/diversification.md) benefit. This [diversification](../d/diversification.md) can help mitigate risks associated with country-specific economic downturns and geopolitical issues.

### Strategic Asset Allocation
The EAFE [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) assists in strategic [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) decisions. Investors utilize the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) to achieve a balanced investment approach by including international equities, which can lead to better [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted returns over the long term.

## Methodology

### Market Capitalization
The EAFE [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) is [weighted](../w/weighted.md) by [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md), reflecting the total [market value](../m/market_value.md) of the companies included within the [index](../i/index_instrument.md). This means that larger companies have a more significant impact on the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) movements.

### Free Float Adjustment
MSCI uses a free [float-adjusted market capitalization](../f/float-adjusted_market_capitalization.md) methodology. The free [float](../f/float.md) adjustment accounts for only the [shares](../s/shares.md) that are available for public trading, excluding strategic [shares](../s/shares.md) held by insiders or governments.

### Rebalancing
The [index](../i/index_instrument.md) is reviewed quarterly in February, May, August, and November. During these reviews, MSCI may adjust the weightings of existing components or include/exclude certain [stocks](../s/stock.md) to ensure the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) accurately reflects the international [equity market](../e/equity_market.md).

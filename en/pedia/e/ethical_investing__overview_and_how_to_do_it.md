# Ethical Investing: Overview and How To Do It

Ethical investing, also known as socially responsible investing (SRI), is an investment strategy that seeks to generate financial returns while also considering social, environmental, and ethical criteria. This form of investing goes beyond traditional financial analysis by integrating personal values and societal considerations into investment decisions. The aim is to support businesses and initiatives that align with specific ethical beliefs while avoiding those that do not.

## What is Ethical Investing?

At its core, ethical investing involves selecting assets that adhere to ethical guidelines or principles. These guidelines are typically defined by the investor's personal values, societal norms, or a combination of both. Key criteria for ethical investing can include:

- Environmental sustainability
- Social impact
- Corporate governance
- Human rights
- Fair labor practices
- Anti-corruption measures

Ethical investors often prioritize companies that actively contribute to positive social and environmental outcomes, such as reducing carbon emissions, promoting diversity and inclusion, protecting human rights, and fostering community development.

## Types of Ethical Investing Strategies

Ethical investing encompasses several strategies, each focusing on different aspects of ethics and responsibility. Common strategies include:

### 1. Negative Screening
Negative screening involves excluding companies or industries that do not meet specific ethical criteria. For example, investors might avoid investing in businesses involved in tobacco, alcohol, gambling, arms manufacturing, or fossil fuels. Negative screening helps investors ensure their portfolios are free from entities they deem unethical.

### 2. Positive Screening
Positive screening, also known as "best-in-class" investing, involves actively selecting companies that excel in certain ethical aspects. Investors look for organizations with strong sustainability practices, superior labor conditions, or advanced corporate governance structures. Companies are often benchmarked against peers within their industry.

### 3. Community Investing
Community investing directs capital towards underserved or marginalized communities. This strategy focuses on providing financing for projects that deliver social or economic benefits at the local level, such as affordable housing, education, healthcare, and small business development.

### 4. Impact Investing
Impact investing seeks to generate measurable social or environmental impact alongside financial returns. Investors target businesses and funds that aim to address pressing global challenges such as poverty, climate change, and access to clean water. Impact investments are typically assessed based on their contributions to specific impact metrics.

### 5. ESG Integration
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) integration involves incorporating ESG factors into traditional financial analysis. Investors evaluate a company's performance on a range of ESG issues and consider how these factors might affect long-term financial performance. ESG integration is becoming increasingly popular among mainstream investors.

### 6. Shareholder Activism
Shareholder activism involves using ownership stakes in a company to influence its behavior. Activist investors may engage with company management, vote on shareholder resolutions, and advocate for changes in corporate policies or practices. The goal is to drive improvements in corporate responsibility and accountability.

## How to Get Started with Ethical Investing

Starting with ethical investing involves several key steps:

### 1. Define Your Values and Goals
First and foremost, identify the ethical principles and priorities that matter most to you. Consider questions such as:

- What social or environmental issues do I care about?
- Are there specific industries or practices I want to avoid?
- What positive impacts do I want my investments to support?

### 4. Diversify Your Portfolio
Diversification remains important in ethical investing. Building a diversified portfolio can help manage risk while staying true to your ethical commitments. Consider allocating investments across different asset classes, sectors, and geographies.

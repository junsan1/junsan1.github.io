# Empirical Rule

The empirical rule, also known as the 68-95-99.7 rule or the three-sigma rule, is a statistical principle that states that for a [normal distribution](../n/normal_distribution_in_trading.md):

- Approximately 68% of the data falls within one [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) (σ) of the mean (μ).
- Approximately 95% of the data falls within two standard deviations (2σ) of the mean (μ).
- Approximately 99.7% of the data falls within three standard deviations (3σ) of the mean (μ).

This rule is significant in [statistics](../s/statistics.md) and various fields including [finance](../f/finance.md), psychology, [quality control](../q/quality_control.md), and natural sciences due to its [utility](../u/utility.md) in understanding the [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of data and making inferences about population parameters based on sample data.

## Definition

The empirical rule pertains to normal distributions, a type of continuous [probability distribution](../p/probability_distribution.md) for a real-valued random variable. Normal distributions are symmetrical and bell-shaped, centered around the mean, with its spread determined by the [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md). The empirical rule provides a quick estimate of the probability of a random variable falling within certain intervals around the mean.

## Formula

For a [normal distribution](../n/normal_distribution_in_trading.md) with mean μ and [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) σ, the empirical rule can be summarized as:

- 68% of observations lie within the [range](../r/range.md) [μ - σ, μ + σ].
- 95% of observations lie within the [range](../r/range.md) [μ - 2σ, μ + 2σ].
- 99.7% of observations lie within the [range](../r/range.md) [μ - 3σ, μ + 3σ].

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

\[ P(\mu - σ \leq X \leq μ + σ) \approx 0.68 \]

\[ P(\mu - 2σ \leq X \leq μ + 2σ) \approx 0.95 \]

\[ P(\mu - 3σ \leq X \leq μ + 3σ) \approx 0.997 \]

Where \( X \) represents the [value](../v/value.md) of the normally distributed variable.

## Example

Consider a dataset of students' math scores which are normally distributed with a mean (μ) of 70 and a [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) (σ) of 10. Using the empirical rule:

- About 68% of students scored between 60 (70-10) and 80 (70+10).
- About 95% of students scored between 50 (70-20) and 90 (70+20).
- About 99.7% of students scored between 40 (70-30) and 100 (70+30).

## How It's Used

### In Finance

In [finance](../f/finance.md), the empirical rule is used to evaluate [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md) for investments. Portfolio managers utilize the rule to estimate the percentage of returns that can be expected to fall within certain ranges. For example, if portfolio returns are normally distributed, and the mean [return](../r/return.md) is 5% with a [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) of 10%, the empirical rule can help estimate the likelihood of returns falling within specific ranges.

### Quality Control

[Quality control](../q/quality_control.md) in [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) processes often employs the empirical rule. Control charts utilize it to monitor process performance. If a process is in control and normal, most output [will](../w/will.md) lie within three standard deviations of the mean. A significant deviation indicates a potential [issue](../i/issue.md) needing investigation.

### In Education

Educational psychologists use the empirical rule to interpret standardized test scores. These scores are typically normally distributed, so the rule assists in determining the proportion of students falling within certain performance brackets.

### In Healthcare

Healthcare professionals apply the empirical rule in epidemiology and public health for examining the spread of diseases and evaluating healthcare interventions. For instance, the rule can help understand the [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of patient responses to a treatment.

### Statistical Inferences

Lastly, the empirical rule aids in making statistical inferences about populations based on sample data. By understanding the spread of sample data around the mean, it's possible to make predictions and decisions using inferential [statistics](../s/statistics.md).

## Conclusion

The empirical rule is a fundamental tenet of [statistics](../s/statistics.md), essential for analyzing normally distributed data. It provides a framework for understanding data [variability](../v/variability.md) and making informed decisions across diverse fields. By applying the empirical rule, professionals can estimate proportions, assess risks, and identify anomalies, making it a critical tool in data-driven environments.

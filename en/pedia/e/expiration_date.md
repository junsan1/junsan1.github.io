# Expiration Date

The expiration date in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) refers to the specific date when a [derivative](../d/derivative.md) contract, such as an [options](../o/options.md) or [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md), ceases to be valid. On this date, the contract must be settled. It is a critical concept in the trading of [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), influencing how traders make their decisions and manage their portfolios. 

## Derivative Contracts

[Derivative](../d/derivative.md) contracts are financial instruments whose [value](../v/value.md) is derived from the [value](../v/value.md) of an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). These assets can include [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, commodities, currencies, [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, or indices. There are various types of [derivative](../d/derivative.md) contracts, including [options](../o/options.md), [futures](../f/futures.md), forwards, and swaps. Each of these contracts has its own expiration date, which is a vital aspect for traders to consider.

### Options

[Options](../o/options.md) contracts give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an [asset](../a/asset.md) at a predetermined [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) before or on the expiration date. There are mainly two types of [options](../o/options.md):

1. **Call [Options](../o/options.md):** These give the holder the right to buy the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).
2. **[Put Options](../p/put_options.md):** These give the holder the right to sell the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

The expiration date for [options](../o/options.md) is particularly significant because it determines the last day on which the option can be exercised. 

### Futures

[Futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) obligate the holder to buy or sell an [asset](../a/asset.md) at a predetermined price on the expiration date. Unlike [options](../o/options.md), [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) must be settled on this date. 

## Importance of Expiration Dates

Expiration dates are crucial for several reasons:

1. **[Time Value](../t/time_value.md) of [Money](../m/money.md):** The [value](../v/value.md) of [options](../o/options.md) and [futures](../f/futures.md) is partly determined by the time remaining until expiration.
2. **Contract Settlement:** The expiration date is the last day for contract settlement.
3. **[Portfolio Management](../p/par.md):** Traders need to know the expiration date to effectively manage their positions and [hedge](../h/hedge.md) risks.
4. **Price [Volatility](../v/volatility.md):** As the expiration date approaches, the [market](../m/market.md) might see increased [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

## Expiration Dates in Different Markets

Expiration dates can vary significantly between different types of markets and contracts:

### Stock Options

Stock [options](../o/options.md) in the United States generally expire on the third Friday of the expiration month. If this happens to be a public holiday, the expiration date is moved forward to the previous trading day. For example, if the third Friday of a month is a holiday, the expiration date moves to Thursday.

### Index Options

[Index options](../i/index_options.md) work similarly to stock [options](../o/options.md) but are based on indices such as the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The expiration date for [index options](../i/index_options.md) is also typically the third Friday of the month.

### Futures Contracts

[Futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) have a more varied expiration structure and can expire monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually. Different commodities and financial instruments [will](../w/will.md) have different expiration cycles. For example, [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md) [futures](../f/futures.md) typically expire monthly, whereas other future contracts might have different cycles.

## Roll-Over

As the expiration date approaches, traders have the option to "roll-over" their positions. Rolling over involves closing the position in the expiring contract and opening a new position in a contract with a later expiration date. This is a common strategy for traders who wish to maintain their exposure to a particular [asset](../a/asset.md) without taking delivery of the [asset](../a/asset.md).

## Settlement Procedures

The settlement procedure for a [derivative](../d/derivative.md) contract can be either physical or cash-settled:

1. **Physical Settlement:** The actual [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) is delivered upon expiration. This is common in [commodity futures](../c/commodity_futures.md) contracts.
2. **Cash Settlement:** Instead of delivering the physical [asset](../a/asset.md), the difference between the [market price](../m/market_price.md) and the contract price is settled in cash. This is common in financial [futures](../f/futures.md) and some [options](../o/options.md).

## Role in Algorithmic Trading

In [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), understanding and accurately predicting the impact of expiration dates is crucial. Algorithms are often designed to take into account the upcoming expiration dates to optimize [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). This includes anticipating increased [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and adjusting positions accordingly.

Various firms and platforms provide services targeted at algorithmic traders to help manage expiration-related complexities. Here are a few examples:

- **[Interactive Brokers](../i/interactive_brokers.md):** An electronic [trading platform](../t/trading_platform.md) that offers tools for managing expiration dates in [derivative](../d/derivative.md) trading. [Interactive Brokers](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/)
  
- **ThinkorSwim by TD [Ameritrade](../a/ameritrade.md):** This platform provides advanced tools for [options](../o/options.md) trading, including features focused on expiration dates. [ThinkorSwim](https://www.tdameritrade.com/thinkorswim.html)

## Conclusion

The expiration date is a fundamental element in the trading of [derivative](../d/derivative.md) contracts, influencing everything from [time value](../t/time_value.md) to [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md). For traders, particularly those engaged in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), understanding the nuances of expiration dates is essential for effective [portfolio management](../p/par.md) and [risk](../r/risk.md) mitigation.

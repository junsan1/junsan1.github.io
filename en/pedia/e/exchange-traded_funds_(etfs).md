# Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)

[Exchange](../e/exchange.md)-Traded Funds (ETFs) are investment funds that are traded on stock exchanges, much like [stocks](../s/stock.md). An ETF holds assets such as [stocks](../s/stock.md), commodities, or bonds and generally operates with an [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) mechanism designed to keep it trading close to its net [asset](../a/asset.md) [value](../v/value.md), although deviations can occasionally occur.

ETFs are a popular choice among investors due to their flexibility, [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), and low costs. They are usually constructed to track an [index](../i/index.md), such as the S&P 500, and provide investors with a way to earn returns similar to the performance of the [index](../i/index.md) without having to buy each individual stock within the [index](../i/index.md).

## Structure and Types of ETFs

### Equity ETFs
[Equity](../e/equity.md) ETFs track a specific [index](../i/index.md) or sector of the [market](../m/market.md), such as technology, healthcare, or energy. They can be broad [market](../m/market.md) ETFs or sector-specific. Examples include the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) and the Technology Select Sector SPDR [Fund](../f/fund.md) (XLK).

### Fixed-Income ETFs
Fixed-[income](../i/income.md) ETFs invest in bonds or other [debt](../d/debt.md) instruments. They can focus on government, municipal, corporate, or high-[yield](../y/yield.md) bonds. Examples include the [iShares](../i/ishares.md) [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) [Bond ETF](../b/bond_etf.md) (GOVT) and the Vanguard Total [Bond Market](../b/bond_market.md) ETF (BND).

### Commodity ETFs
[Commodity](../c/commodity.md) ETFs invest in physical commodities like gold, silver, oil, or agricultural products. Notable examples include the SPDR Gold [Shares](../s/shares.md) (GLD) and the United States Oil [Fund](../f/fund.md) (USO).

### Inverse and Leveraged ETFs
[Inverse ETFs](../i/inverse_etfs.md) are designed to [profit](../p/profit.md) from a decline in the [value](../v/value.md) of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [index](../i/index.md) or [asset](../a/asset.md). [Leveraged ETFs](../l/leveraged_etfs.md) aim to deliver multiples of the performance of the [index](../i/index.md) they track, both on the [upside](../u/upside.md) and downside. Examples include the ProShares UltraPro Short S&P 500 ETF (SPXU) and the Direxion Daily Financial [Bull](../b/bull.md) 3x [Shares](../s/shares.md) (FAS).

### International ETFs
International ETFs provide exposure to foreign markets and can be segmented by region (e.g., Europe, Asia) or by country. Examples include the [iShares](../i/ishares.md) MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM) and the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF (VGK).

## Mechanism and Operation

### Creation and Redemption Process
ETFs are created and redeemed through a process involving authorized participants (APs), which are typically large financial institutions. The process involves the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) of the ETF's [underlying](../u/underlying.md) securities for ETF [shares](../s/shares.md) (creation) or ETF [shares](../s/shares.md) for the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) securities ([redemption](../r/redemption.md)).

### Arbitrage Mechanism
The [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) mechanism ensures the price of the ETF remains close to its net [asset](../a/asset.md) [value](../v/value.md) (NAV). If the ETF's [market price](../m/market_price.md) deviates from the NAV, authorized participants can take advantage of the discrepancy. If the ETF is trading at a [discount](../d/discount.md), APs buy the ETF [shares](../s/shares.md) and sell the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) securities. If the ETF is trading at a [premium](../p/premium.md), APs buy the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) securities and create new ETF [shares](../s/shares.md) to sell on the [market](../m/market.md).

### Dividends and Capital Gains
ETFs typically distribute dividends received from their [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) to shareholders in the form of periodic payments. [Capital](../c/capital.md) gains distributions can also occur, though they are usually minimized due to the in-kind creation and [redemption](../r/redemption.md) process that allows ETFs to manage and control taxable events.

## Advantages of ETFs

### Diversification
ETFs provide investors with access to a diversified portfolio of securities, which can help reduce [risk](../r/risk.md) compared to [investing](../i/investing.md) in individual [stocks](../s/stock.md) or bonds. By tracking an [index](../i/index.md), ETFs enable investors to [gain](../g/gain.md) exposure to a broader [market](../m/market.md) or specific sectors with a single investment.

### Liquidity
ETFs [trade](../t/trade.md) on exchanges throughout the trading day at [market](../m/market.md) prices, providing investors with the ability to buy and sell [shares](../s/shares.md) with ease. This [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) makes it simpler to enter and exit positions compared to mutual funds, which are priced only at the end of the trading day.

### Cost Efficiency
ETFs typically have lower [expense](../e/expense.md) ratios compared to mutual funds because they are passively managed, tracking an [index](../i/index.md) rather than relying on [active management](../a/active_management.md). This cost-[efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) can result in higher net returns for investors over time.

### Transparency
ETFs are generally required to disclose their [holdings](../h/holdings.md) on a daily [basis](../b/basis.md), providing investors with a clear view of the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s investments. This [transparency](../t/transparency.md) can help investors make more informed decisions.

### Tax Efficiency
Due to the in-kind creation and [redemption](../r/redemption.md) process, ETFs can minimize [capital](../c/capital.md) gains distributions, making them more tax-efficient than mutual funds. Investors can potentially defer [taxes](../t/taxes.md) until they sell their ETF [shares](../s/shares.md).

### Flexibility
ETFs [offer](../o/offer.md) flexibility in terms of investment strategies. Investors can use ETFs for a variety of purposes, including hedging [risk](../r/risk.md), gaining exposure to specific sectors or markets, or implementing tactical [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md).

## Risks and Considerations

### Market Risk
Like all investments, ETFs are subject to [market risk](../m/market_risk.md). The [value](../v/value.md) of an ETF can fluctuate based on the performance of its [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets. Investors should be prepared for potential losses, especially in volatile markets.

### Tracking Error
[Tracking error](../t/tracking_error.md) refers to the discrepancy between the ETF's performance and the performance of the [index](../i/index.md) it aims to track. Factors contributing to [tracking error](../t/tracking_error.md) include management fees, [trading costs](../t/trading_costs.md), and imperfect replication of the [index](../i/index.md). 

### Liquidity Risk
While many ETFs are highly [liquid](../l/liquid.md), some ETFs, especially those that invest in less [liquid](../l/liquid.md) assets, can experience [liquidity risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md). This [risk](../r/risk.md) can manifest in wider [bid](../b/bid.md)-ask [spreads](../s/spreads.md) and increased [trading costs](../t/trading_costs.md) during periods of [market](../m/market.md) stress or [illiquidity](../i/illiquid.md).

### Counterparty Risk
ETFs that use [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) or engage in [securities lending](../s/securities_lending.md) are exposed to [counterparty risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md). This [risk](../r/risk.md) arises from the possibility that the [counterparty](../c/counterparty.md) to a [transaction](../t/transaction.md) might [default](../d/default.md) on its [obligations](../o/obligation.md).

### Complexity
Some types of ETFs, such as leveraged and [inverse ETFs](../i/inverse_etfs.md), are more complex and might not be suitable for all investors. These ETFs require a higher level of understanding due to their unique risks and investment strategies.

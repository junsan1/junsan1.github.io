# Global Depositary Receipt (GDR)

A Global [Depositary Receipt](../d/depositary_receipt.md) (GDR) is a [bank](../b/bank.md) certificate issued in more than one country for [shares](../s/shares.md) in a foreign company. These [shares](../s/shares.md) are held by a foreign branch of an international [bank](../b/bank.md). They are traded as domestic [shares](../s/shares.md) but are offered for [sale](../s/sale.md) globally through the various [bank](../b/bank.md) branches. GDRs are widely used to tap into the global [equity](../e/equity.md) markets by foreign issuers. 

## Overview and Definition

### What is a Global Depositary Receipt?

A Global [Depositary Receipt](../d/depositary_receipt.md) (GDR) serves as a [negotiable](../n/negotiable.md) instrument that represents [shares](../s/shares.md) in a foreign company, facilitating international [trade](../t/trade.md) in the companyâ€™s [shares](../s/shares.md). Essentially, GDRs allow investors to [hold](../h/hold.md) [shares](../s/shares.md) in foreign companies without the complications of cross-border and securities regulatory constraints. These instruments enable companies to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) from [multiple](../m/multiple.md) international markets through a single [security](../s/security.md). 

### How GDRs Work

GDRs are predominantly issued by international banks. The process begins when a foreign company deposits its [shares](../s/shares.md) with a domestic [custodian](../c/custodian.md) [bank](../b/bank.md). The international [bank](../b/bank.md) then issues GDRs based on these [shares](../s/shares.md), usually in more than one country. These [receipts](../r/receipt.md) are traded on local stock exchanges as domestic [shares](../s/shares.md), despite representing [shares](../s/shares.md) in a foreign entity.

## Mechanisms and Structure

### Issuance Process

The issuance of GDRs involves several steps and parties:

1. **Depositing [Shares](../s/shares.md)**: The foreign company deposits its [shares](../s/shares.md) with a [custodian](../c/custodian.md) [bank](../b/bank.md) in its [home](../h/home.md) country.
2. **Issuing GDRs**: The [custodian](../c/custodian.md) [bank](../b/bank.md) then informs the [depository](../d/depository.md) [bank](../b/bank.md) (an international [bank](../b/bank.md)), which issues the [receipts](../r/receipt.md) based on the deposited [shares](../s/shares.md).
3. **Trading**: These GDRs are then [listed](../l/listed.md) and traded on international stock exchanges, where they can be purchased by investors in different countries.

### Custodian and Depository Banks

- **[Custodian](../c/custodian.md) [Bank](../b/bank.md)**: Holds the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [shares](../s/shares.md) on behalf of the investors and ensures that the rights of the investors are protected.
- **[Depository](../d/depository.md) [Bank](../b/bank.md)**: Issues the GDRs and facilitates the trading of these [receipts](../r/receipt.md) in global markets.

### Dividend Distribution

Dividends from the foreign [shares](../s/shares.md) are collected by the [custodian](../c/custodian.md) [bank](../b/bank.md) and then passed through the [depository](../d/depository.md) [bank](../b/bank.md) to the GDR holders, typically in the investors' local [currency](../c/currency.md). This allows investors to receive dividends without dealing in foreign currencies.

## Advantages of GDRs

### For Companies

1. **Access to [Capital Markets](../c/capital_markets.md)**: GDRs enable companies to access [multiple](../m/multiple.md) international [capital markets](../c/capital_markets.md) simultaneously, broadening their [investor](../i/investor.md) base.
2. **Increased [Visibility](../v/visibility.md)**: Listing on major international exchanges increases company [visibility](../v/visibility.md) and can lead to enhanced [investor](../i/investor.md) perception.
3. **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md) of Funding Sources**: Provides companies with the opportunity to attract investments from different regions, reducing reliance on domestic markets.

### For Investors

1. **International [Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: GDRs allow investors to diversify their portfolios internationally without direct exposure to foreign markets.
2. **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)**: GDRs are traded on major stock exchanges, providing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and flexibility for investors.
3. **Ease of Trading**: Investors can [trade](../t/trade.md) in their local markets without the complexities of dealing with foreign exchanges and regulations.

## Risks and Considerations

### Foreign Exchange Risk

Since GDRs represent [shares](../s/shares.md) in a foreign company, they expose investors to [foreign exchange risk](../f/foreign_exchange_risk.md). Fluctuations in [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates can impact investment returns.

### Regulatory Risks

Investors face regulatory risks stemming from differences in [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) practices, [accounting](../a/accounting.md) standards, and regulatory environments between their [home](../h/home.md) country and the issuing company's country.

### Market Risks

GDRs are subject to [market](../m/market.md) risks like any other [equity](../e/equity.md) investment, including [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and changes in [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

## Major Markets for GDRs

### London Stock Exchange (LSE)

The London Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) is a prominent venue for trading GDRs. Companies from emerging markets often use the LSE to [issue](../i/issue.md) GDRs and access the vast pool of international [capital](../c/capital.md) available in London.

### Luxembourg Stock Exchange

The Luxembourg Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) specializes in GDR listings and provides a conducive regulatory environment for such instruments.

### Singapore Exchange (SGX)

The Singapore [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) offers a platform for trading GDRs, helping companies tap into the affluent and growing markets in Asia.

## Examples of Companies Using GDRs

Several major companies use GDRs to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) in international markets. Here are a few examples:

- **Infosys**: An Indian [multinational corporation](../m/multinational_corporation.md) that provides [business](../b/business.md) consulting, information technology, and [outsourcing](../o/outsourcing.md) services ([Infosys](https://www.infosys.com)).
- **Lukoil**: A Russian multinational energy [corporation](../c/corporation.md) ([Lukoil](https://www.lukoil.com)).
- **Gazprom**: A large Russian energy company ([Gazprom](https://www.gazprom.com)).

These companies are able to tap into a wider pool of investment by issuing GDRs, benefiting from the increased [capital](../c/capital.md) and expanded [investor](../i/investor.md) base.

## Conclusion

Global Depositary [Receipts](../r/receipt.md) (GDRs) are an essential [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) for both companies and investors looking to expand their horizons internationally. They [offer](../o/offer.md) companies a method to access [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [capital markets](../c/capital_markets.md) while providing investors a way to diversify their portfolios globally. Despite the risks associated with [currency exchange](../c/currency_exchange.md) and regulatory differences, GDRs remain a popular vehicle for international [trade](../t/trade.md) and investment, enhancing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), [visibility](../v/visibility.md), and financial opportunities on a global scale.

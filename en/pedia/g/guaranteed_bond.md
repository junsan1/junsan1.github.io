# Guaranteed Bond

A guaranteed [bond](../b/bond.md) is a type of [bond](../b/bond.md) in which the [principal](../p/principal.md) and [interest](../i/interest.md) payments are guaranteed by a [third party](../t/third_party.md), typically a [bank](../b/bank.md), [insurance](../i/insurance.md) company, or government entity. This guarantee ensures that bondholders receive their payments on time even if the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) defaults. The [third party](../t/third_party.md)'s [assurance](../a/assurance.md) reduces the [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with the [bond](../b/bond.md), often resulting in a higher [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) and lower [yield](../y/yield.md) compared to non-guaranteed bonds issued by the same entity.

## Issuers

Guaranteed bonds are typically issued by:

- **Government entities**: Local, state, or federal governments may [issue](../i/issue.md) bonds with guarantees to [finance](../f/finance.md) various public projects.
- **Corporations**: Companies may [issue](../i/issue.md) guaranteed bonds to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) for projects or operations, using a [guarantor](../g/guarantor.md) to increase [investor](../i/investor.md) confidence.
- **Municipalities**: Local governments and municipal entities [issue](../i/issue.md) guaranteed bonds to [finance](../f/finance.md) [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) projects such as roads, schools, and hospitals.
- **Special purpose vehicles (SPVs)**: These entities may [issue](../i/issue.md) bonds for specific projects or activities, with a guarantee provided to attract investors.

## Guarantors

The entities providing guarantees include:

- **Banks**: Major financial institutions often guarantee bonds issued by corporations or municipalities.
- **[Insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies**: They may provide guarantees based on their assessment of the [issuer](../i/issuer.md)'s [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md).
- **Government agencies**: In some cases, federal or state agencies provide guarantees to support critical [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) or public service projects.

## Types of Guarantees

Guaranteed bonds may feature different types of guarantees, such as:

- **Full guarantee**: The [guarantor](../g/guarantor.md) fully covers both [principal](../p/principal.md) and [interest](../i/interest.md) payments.
- **Partial guarantee**: The [guarantor](../g/guarantor.md) covers only a portion of the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s [principal](../p/principal.md) or [interest](../i/interest.md) payments.
- **Conditional guarantee**: The [guarantor](../g/guarantor.md) offers protection only under certain conditions, such as specific financial metrics or project milestones.

## Benefits

The primary advantages of guaranteed bonds include:

- **Reduced [risk](../r/risk.md)**: The guarantee adds a layer of [security](../s/security.md), making these bonds less risky than non-guaranteed bonds.
- **Higher [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md)**: The involvement of a reputable [guarantor](../g/guarantor.md) often results in a better [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) from [rating](../r/rating.md) agencies.
- **Lower [yield](../y/yield.md)**: Investors may accept a lower [yield](../y/yield.md) due to the reduced [risk](../r/risk.md) and higher [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md).
- **Increased [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)**: The guarantee can make the [bond](../b/bond.md) more attractive to a wider [range](../r/range.md) of investors, enhancing its [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).

## Examples of Guaranteed Bonds

### U.S. Treasury Bonds

Although not explicitly called "guaranteed," [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) bonds are backed by the full faith and [credit](../c/credit.md) of the U.S. government, making them effectively guaranteed. These bonds are considered one of the safest investments globally.

### Municipal Bonds

[Municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md), or "munis," may come with guarantees from state programs or private insurers. For example, the **Build America Bonds (BABs)** program, created under the American Recovery and [Reinvestment](../r/reinvestment.md) Act of 2009, provided federal subsidies for [interest](../i/interest.md) payments on certain [municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md).

### Corporate Bonds

Corporations sometimes [issue](../i/issue.md) guaranteed bonds to [finance](../f/finance.md) significant projects. For instance, a company might use a [bank guarantee](../b/bank_guarantee.md) to [offer](../o/offer.md) lower yields to investors, thereby reducing its [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md).

Bonds guaranteed by a [third party](../t/third_party.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) a blend of [security](../s/security.md) and stability, appealing to [risk-averse](../r/risk-averse.md) investors seeking reliable [income](../i/income.md) streams. The [market](../m/market.md) for these bonds continues to evolve, influenced by [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md), regulatory changes, and the [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) of guarantors and issuers.

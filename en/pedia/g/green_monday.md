# Green Monday

Green Monday is an environmentally-focused retail shopping event that typically occurs on the second Monday of December. First coined and popularized by e-[commerce](../c/commerce.md) giant eBay in 2007, it signifies one of the largest online shopping days of the holiday season. Unlike Cyber Monday and [Black Friday](../b/black_friday.md), which primarily focus on consumer deals and discounts, Green Monday combines the aspects of promotional retail efforts with an emphasis on sustainable and environmentally-friendly practices.

## Origins and Concept

Green Monday was conceived as a response to the growing awareness of environmental sustainability in consumer behavior, as well as eBay's desire to extend the holiday shopping period. Strategically positioned in December, it serves as one of the last significant opportunities for consumers to make online purchases that [will](../w/will.md) arrive in time for Christmas.

The term "Green" in Green Monday has a dual significance. It not only relates to the financial aspect of the [lucrative](../l/lucrative.md) shopping day but also symbolizes the event's environmentally friendly angle. The emphasis is on encouraging consumers to purchase from brands that commit to sustainable practices, whether itâ€™s through eco-friendly [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) processes, supporting ethical [supply](../s/supply.md) chains, or [offering](../o/offering.md) products made from recycled materials.

## Key Features

### Sustainability Focus
- **Eco-Friendly Products**: Retailers promote products that are sustainable, made from recycled materials, or have a reduced environmental impact.
- **Corporate [Social Responsibility](../s/social_responsibility.md) (CSR)**: Companies often highlight their CSR initiatives which may include reducing carbon footprints, fair [trade](../t/trade.md) certifications, and community upliftment projects.

### Consumer Savings
- **Deals and Discounts**: Similar to other shopping holidays, Green Monday features significant markdowns and special promotions. The key difference lies in the promotion of sustainable and eco-friendly products.
- **Awareness and Education**: Retailers and organizations use the day to educate consumers about the benefits of sustainable shopping and the impact of their purchasing decisions on the environment.

## Impact and Trends

Green Monday has consistently ranked as one of the top online shopping days during the holiday season. For instance, in 2019, Green Monday generated nearly $3 billion in online spending in the United States alone. This figure indicates an increasing consumer willingness to participate in the event, driven by both deals and an awareness of sustainability.

### Retailer Participation

Furthermore, smaller companies and online businesses that specialize in sustainable goods use the day to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on increased traffic and awareness.

### Technological Integration

# Gamma Trading

[Gamma](../g/gamma.md) trading is a strategy used primarily by [options](../o/options.md) traders to manage the [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with changes in the [delta](../d/delta.md) of their [options](../o/options.md) positions. [Delta](../d/delta.md) represents the sensitivity of an option's price to movements in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). [Gamma](../g/gamma.md), on the other hand, measures the rate of change in [delta](../d/delta.md) with respect to changes in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price.

## Understanding Gamma

[Gamma](../g/gamma.md) is a second-[order](../o/order.md) [derivative](../d/derivative.md) of the option's price relative to the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). In simpler terms, while [delta](../d/delta.md) measures the change in the price of an option for a $1 change in the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), [gamma](../g/gamma.md) measures how much the [delta](../d/delta.md) itself would change for a $1 change in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

For instance, if an option has a [delta](../d/delta.md) of 0.5 and a [gamma](../g/gamma.md) of 0.02, a $1 increase in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price would increase the [delta](../d/delta.md) to 0.52. Conversely, a $1 decrease in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price would reduce the [delta](../d/delta.md) to 0.48.

## Importance of Gamma Trading

[Gamma](../g/gamma.md) trading is essential for several reasons:

1. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Traders use [gamma](../g/gamma.md) to manage the [risk](../r/risk.md) of their [options](../o/options.md) portfolios. High [gamma](../g/gamma.md) implies that [delta](../d/delta.md) is highly sensitive to changes in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). [Options](../o/options.md) traders, especially [market](../m/market.md) makers, need to frequently adjust their positions to remain [delta](../d/delta.md)-[neutral](../n/neutral.md).

2. **[Profit](../p/profit.md) Opportunities**: By understanding and trading [gamma](../g/gamma.md), traders can potentially [profit](../p/profit.md) from [volatility](../v/volatility.md). High [gamma](../g/gamma.md) can lead to significant changes in [delta](../d/delta.md), providing opportunities for gains during volatile markets.

3. **Strategic Adjustments**: [Gamma](../g/gamma.md) allows traders to make strategic adjustments to their positions to take advantage of expected [market](../m/market.md) movements or to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against unfavorable moves.

## Hedging with Gamma

**[Delta](../d/delta.md)-[Neutral](../n/neutral.md) Strategies**: One common use of [gamma](../g/gamma.md) is in [delta](../d/delta.md)-[neutral](../n/neutral.md) strategies. In a [delta](../d/delta.md)-[neutral](../n/neutral.md) portfolio, the total [delta](../d/delta.md) is zero, meaning the portfolio's [value](../v/value.md) should theoretically be unaffected by small price movements in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). However, since [delta](../d/delta.md) is not constant and changes with the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price, maintaining a [delta](../d/delta.md)-[neutral](../n/neutral.md) position requires continual adjustments. This is where [gamma](../g/gamma.md) comes into play.

Traders monitor the [gamma](../g/gamma.md) of their portfolio to anticipate how [delta](../d/delta.md) [will](../w/will.md) change as the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) moves. By doing so, they can make proactive adjustments to maintain [delta](../d/delta.md)-neutrality. For example, if a [trader](../t/trader.md) holds a [delta](../d/delta.md)-[neutral](../n/neutral.md) position with positive [gamma](../g/gamma.md), any movement in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price [will](../w/will.md) cause the position to become [delta](../d/delta.md)-positive or [delta](../d/delta.md)-negative. The [trader](../t/trader.md) [will](../w/will.md) need to buy or sell the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) to bring the [delta](../d/delta.md) back to zero.

**Positive vs. Negative [Gamma](../g/gamma.md)**: The sign of the [gamma](../g/gamma.md) also matters. A position with positive [gamma](../g/gamma.md) [will](../w/will.md) have increasing [delta](../d/delta.md) as the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) price goes up and decreasing [delta](../d/delta.md) as the price goes down, which can be beneficial in volatile markets. Conversely, a position with negative [gamma](../g/gamma.md) [will](../w/will.md) have decreasing [delta](../d/delta.md) as the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) price goes up and increasing [delta](../d/delta.md) as it goes down, which can result in losses in volatile markets.

## Gamma Scalping

[Gamma scalping](../g/gamma_scalping.md) is a popular [gamma](../g/gamma.md) [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) that involves a continuous adjustment of [delta](../d/delta.md) to [profit](../p/profit.md) from the natural movement of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). Here’s a step-by-step outline of how [gamma scalping](../g/gamma_scalping.md) works:

1. **Establish a [Delta](../d/delta.md)-[Neutral](../n/neutral.md) Position**: Begin with a [delta](../d/delta.md)-[neutral](../n/neutral.md) [options](../o/options.md) position. This might involve buying [options](../o/options.md) and the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) in proportions that neutralize the [delta](../d/delta.md).

2. **Monitor [Gamma](../g/gamma.md) and [Delta](../d/delta.md) Changes**: As the [market price](../m/market_price.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) changes, continuously monitor the changes in [delta](../d/delta.md). The position’s [gamma](../g/gamma.md) [will](../w/will.md) dictate how sensitive the [delta](../d/delta.md) is to these price changes.

3. **Adjustments**: When the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) moves, the [delta](../d/delta.md) of the [options](../o/options.md) position [will](../w/will.md) change. To maintain [delta](../d/delta.md)-neutrality, the [trader](../t/trader.md) must buy or sell the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). For example, if the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price rises, the [trader](../t/trader.md) may need to sell a portion of the [asset](../a/asset.md) to neutralize the positive [delta](../d/delta.md).

4. **[Profit](../p/profit.md) from [Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: The frequent buying and selling of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) allow the [trader](../t/trader.md) to capture small gains from the price movements. Over time, these small gains can accumulate, especially in volatile markets.

[Gamma scalping](../g/gamma_scalping.md) requires sophisticated modeling and constant monitoring, often facilitated by [automated trading systems](../a/automated_trading_systems.md). The goal is to maintain [delta](../d/delta.md)-neutrality while exploiting the [gamma](../g/gamma.md)-driven changes in [delta](../d/delta.md).

## Risks and Considerations

While [gamma](../g/gamma.md) trading offers potential benefits, it also comes with risks:

1. **[Transaction Costs](../t/transaction_costs.md)**: Frequent adjustments to maintain [delta](../d/delta.md) neutrality can incur significant [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md). These costs can eat into profits, especially if the model used to predict [gamma](../g/gamma.md) adjustments is not highly accurate.

2. **[Model Risk](../m/model_risk.md)**: The effectiveness of [gamma](../g/gamma.md) trading relies on accurate models to predict [gamma](../g/gamma.md) and its impact on [delta](../d/delta.md). If the models are flawed, the [trader](../t/trader.md) may not accurately [hedge](../h/hedge.md) their positions, resulting in losses.

3. **[Market](../m/market.md) Conditions**: [Gamma](../g/gamma.md) [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) can perform poorly in certain [market](../m/market.md) conditions. For instance, in low [volatility](../v/volatility.md) markets, there might not be enough price movement to generate profits from [gamma scalping](../g/gamma_scalping.md).

4. **Complexity**: [Gamma](../g/gamma.md) trading requires a deep understanding of [options](../o/options.md) pricing and the interactions between different [Greeks](../g/greeks.md). It is a complex strategy that might not be suitable for all traders.

## Conclusion

[Gamma](../g/gamma.md) trading is a sophisticated strategy involving the management and exploitation of the [gamma](../g/gamma.md) of [options](../o/options.md) positions. By focusing on how [delta](../d/delta.md) changes with the price movements of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), traders can manage [risk](../r/risk.md), maintain [delta](../d/delta.md)-[neutral](../n/neutral.md) positions, and potentially [profit](../p/profit.md) from [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md). However, [gamma](../g/gamma.md) trading requires deep knowledge, precise modeling, and constant monitoring, along with considerations for [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md) and [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

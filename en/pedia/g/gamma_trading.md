# Gamma Trading

Gamma trading is a strategy used primarily by options traders to manage the risk associated with changes in the delta of their options positions. Delta represents the sensitivity of an option's price to movements in the underlying asset. Gamma, on the other hand, measures the rate of change in delta with respect to changes in the underlying asset's price.

## Understanding Gamma

Gamma is a second-order derivative of the option's price relative to the price of the underlying asset. In simpler terms, while delta measures the change in the price of an option for a $1 change in the price of the underlying asset, gamma measures how much the delta itself would change for a $1 change in the underlying asset.

For instance, if an option has a delta of 0.5 and a gamma of 0.02, a $1 increase in the underlying asset's price would increase the delta to 0.52. Conversely, a $1 decrease in the underlying asset's price would reduce the delta to 0.48.

## Importance of Gamma Trading

Gamma trading is essential for several reasons:

1. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Traders use gamma to manage the risk of their options portfolios. High gamma implies that delta is highly sensitive to changes in the underlying asset. Options traders, especially market makers, need to frequently adjust their positions to remain delta-neutral.

2. **Profit Opportunities**: By understanding and trading gamma, traders can potentially profit from volatility. High gamma can lead to significant changes in delta, providing opportunities for gains during volatile markets.

3. **Strategic Adjustments**: Gamma allows traders to make strategic adjustments to their positions to take advantage of expected market movements or to hedge against unfavorable moves.

## Hedging with Gamma

**Delta-Neutral Strategies**: One common use of gamma is in delta-neutral strategies. In a delta-neutral portfolio, the total delta is zero, meaning the portfolio's value should theoretically be unaffected by small price movements in the underlying asset. However, since delta is not constant and changes with the underlying asset's price, maintaining a delta-neutral position requires continual adjustments. This is where gamma comes into play.

Traders monitor the gamma of their portfolio to anticipate how delta will change as the price of the underlying asset moves. By doing so, they can make proactive adjustments to maintain delta-neutrality. For example, if a trader holds a delta-neutral position with positive gamma, any movement in the underlying asset's price will cause the position to become delta-positive or delta-negative. The trader will need to buy or sell the underlying asset to bring the delta back to zero.

**Positive vs. Negative Gamma**: The sign of the gamma also matters. A position with positive gamma will have increasing delta as the underlying price goes up and decreasing delta as the price goes down, which can be beneficial in volatile markets. Conversely, a position with negative gamma will have decreasing delta as the underlying price goes up and increasing delta as it goes down, which can result in losses in volatile markets.

## Gamma Scalping

[Gamma scalping](../g/gamma_scalping.md) is a popular gamma trading strategy that involves a continuous adjustment of delta to profit from the natural movement of the underlying asset. Here’s a step-by-step outline of how [gamma scalping](../g/gamma_scalping.md) works:

1. **Establish a Delta-Neutral Position**: Begin with a delta-neutral options position. This might involve buying options and the underlying asset in proportions that neutralize the delta.

2. **Monitor Gamma and Delta Changes**: As the market price of the underlying asset changes, continuously monitor the changes in delta. The position’s gamma will dictate how sensitive the delta is to these price changes.

3. **Adjustments**: When the price of the underlying asset moves, the delta of the options position will change. To maintain delta-neutrality, the trader must buy or sell the underlying asset. For example, if the underlying asset's price rises, the trader may need to sell a portion of the asset to neutralize the positive delta.

4. **Profit from Volatility**: The frequent buying and selling of the underlying asset allow the trader to capture small gains from the price movements. Over time, these small gains can accumulate, especially in volatile markets.

[Gamma scalping](../g/gamma_scalping.md) requires sophisticated modeling and constant monitoring, often facilitated by [automated trading systems](../a/automated_trading_systems.md). The goal is to maintain delta-neutrality while exploiting the gamma-driven changes in delta.

## Risks and Considerations

While gamma trading offers potential benefits, it also comes with risks:

1. **Transaction Costs**: Frequent adjustments to maintain delta neutrality can incur significant transaction costs. These costs can eat into profits, especially if the model used to predict gamma adjustments is not highly accurate.

2. **Model Risk**: The effectiveness of gamma trading relies on accurate models to predict gamma and its impact on delta. If the models are flawed, the trader may not accurately hedge their positions, resulting in losses.

3. **Market Conditions**: Gamma [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) can perform poorly in certain market conditions. For instance, in low volatility markets, there might not be enough price movement to generate profits from [gamma scalping](../g/gamma_scalping.md).

4. **Complexity**: Gamma trading requires a deep understanding of options pricing and the interactions between different Greeks. It is a complex strategy that might not be suitable for all traders.

## Notable Companies and Resources

## Conclusion

Gamma trading is a sophisticated strategy involving the management and exploitation of the gamma of options positions. By focusing on how delta changes with the price movements of the underlying asset, traders can manage risk, maintain delta-neutral positions, and potentially profit from market volatility. However, gamma trading requires deep knowledge, precise modeling, and constant monitoring, along with considerations for transaction costs and market conditions.

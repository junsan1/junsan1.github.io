This [insurance](../i/insurance.md) provides essential financial protection against claims that may arise from the day-to-day operations of the [business](../b/business.md), such as bodily injury, property damage, and other liabilities. This guide delves into the various aspects of garage [liability insurance](../l/liability_insurance.md), including its purpose, coverage [options](../o/options.md), exclusions, and the types of businesses that require it.

## Understanding Garage Liability Insurance

Garage [liability insurance](../l/liability_insurance.md) is tailored for businesses that operate in the automotive service [industry](../i/industry.md). This includes garages, auto repair shops, body shops, car dealerships, and any other businesses that involve handling, storing, or repairing [customer](../c/customer.md) vehicles. The policy typically covers both premises liabilities and operations liabilities, ensuring comprehensive protection.

### Key Coverage Components

1. **Premises [Liability](../l/liability.md)**: This coverage protects the [business](../b/business.md) if someone is injured on the [business](../b/business.md)'s property. For instance, if a [customer](../c/customer.md) slips and falls while waiting for their car to be serviced, premises [liability](../l/liability.md) would cover the medical expenses and potential legal costs associated with the injury.

2. **Operations [Liability](../l/liability.md)**: This type of coverage protects against liabilities arising from the [business](../b/business.md) operations.

4. **Completed Operations**: This coverage extends protection for services that have been completed but result in damage or injury at a later time.

### Examples of Covered Scenarios

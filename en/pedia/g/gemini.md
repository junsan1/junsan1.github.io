# Gemini

Gemini is a cryptocurrency [exchange](../e/exchange.md) and [custodian](../c/custodian.md) that allows customers to buy, sell, and store digital assets such as [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) and [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md). It was founded in 2014 by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, best known for their involvement in the early development of Facebook and subsequent legal battles over the ownership of the [social media](../s/social_media.md) giant. 

Headquartered in New York City, Gemini aims to build a bridge between the traditional [financial system](../f/financial_system.md) and the new, emerging world of cryptocurrency. It is known for its rigorous regulatory compliance and focus on [security](../s/security.md), making it appealing to both individual and institutional investors.

## History and Founding

Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, often referred to as the Winklevoss twins, conceived the idea of Gemini after experiencing difficulties in purchasing [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) safely and efficiently through existing platforms. Following the inception of the idea in 2013, they founded Gemini in 2014. The name "Gemini" is derived from the Latin word for twins, signifying the dual identity of the co-founders.

## Regulatory Compliance

Gemini has made a concerted effort to exceed regulatory requirements. It was one of the first cryptocurrency companies to receive a BitLicense from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) in 2015. This license allows Gemini to operate in New York and is renowned for its stringent guidelines. Gemini also adheres to anti-[money laundering](../m/money_laundering.md) (AML) and know your [customer](../c/customer.md) (KYC) policies which add layers of [security](../s/security.md) and regulatory compliance.

# Gemini

Gemini is a cryptocurrency exchange and custodian that allows customers to buy, sell, and store digital assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. It was founded in 2014 by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, best known for their involvement in the early development of Facebook and subsequent legal battles over the ownership of the social media giant. 

Headquartered in New York City, Gemini aims to build a bridge between the traditional financial system and the new, emerging world of cryptocurrency. It is known for its rigorous regulatory compliance and focus on security, making it appealing to both individual and institutional investors.

## History and Founding

Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, often referred to as the Winklevoss twins, conceived the idea of Gemini after experiencing difficulties in purchasing Bitcoin safely and efficiently through existing platforms. Following the inception of the idea in 2013, they founded Gemini in 2014. The name "Gemini" is derived from the Latin word for twins, signifying the dual identity of the co-founders.

## Regulatory Compliance

Gemini has made a concerted effort to exceed regulatory requirements. It was one of the first cryptocurrency companies to receive a BitLicense from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) in 2015. This license allows Gemini to operate in New York and is renowned for its stringent guidelines. Gemini also adheres to anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) policies which add layers of security and regulatory compliance.

## Security Features

Security is a cornerstone of Gemini's operational philosophy. The exchange employs a variety of security measures to safeguard user assets and information. These measures include:

- **Cold Storage**: The majority of digital assets are stored in cold storage, which is offline and inaccessible from the internet.

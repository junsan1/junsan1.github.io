# General Ledger

A general ledger is a critical component of accounting systems used by businesses. It is a comprehensive record of all financial transactions carried out by an organization during a specific period. This accounting ledger provides an organized view of all the company's accounts and is used to produce key financial statements, including the balance sheet and income statement.

## Structure and Components of a General Ledger

A standard general ledger is typically organized into sections based on asset, liability, equity, revenue, and expense accounts. Each section includes specific accounts that capture various types of financial activities:

### 1. Asset Accounts
Asset accounts represent resources owned by the business that have economic value. Common asset accounts include:
- **Cash and Cash Equivalents**: Includes currency, bank balances, and other liquid assets.
- **Accounts Receivable**: Money owed by customers for goods or services delivered.
- **Inventory**: The value of goods available for sale.
- **Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E)**: Long-term assets such as buildings and machinery.

### 2. Liability Accounts
Liability accounts record the company's obligations or debts. Key types include:
- **Accounts Payable**: Money owed to suppliers for goods or services received.
- **Accrued Liabilities**: Expenses that have been incurred but not yet paid.
- **Loans Payable**: The outstanding amount of money borrowed.
- **Bonds Payable**: Long-term debt issued by the company through bonds.

### 3. Equity Accounts
Equity accounts track the owner's or shareholders' residual interest in the business. Common equity accounts are:
- **Common Stock**: Equity investment by shareholders.
- **Retained Earnings**: Accumulated net income not distributed to shareholders.
- **Additional Paid-In Capital**: Extra amount paid by shareholders over the par value of the stock.

### 4. Revenue Accounts
Revenue accounts capture the income earned from business operations. Types include:
- **Sales Revenue**: Income from selling goods or services.
- **Service Revenue**: Income from providing services.
- **Interest Revenue**: Income from interest-bearing accounts or investments.

### 5. Expense Accounts
Expense accounts record costs incurred in the course of business operations. Notable categories include:
- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: Direct costs attributable to the sale of goods.
- **Salaries Expense**: Payments made to employees.
- **Rent Expense**: Costs for leasing spaces.
- **Utilities Expense**: Expenses for utilities like electricity and water.

## The Double-Entry System

The underlying principle of general ledger accounting is the double-entry system, which ensures that every financial transaction has equal and opposite effects in at least two different accounts. This system maintains the accounting equation:
\[ \text{Assets} = \text{Liabilities} + \text{Equity} \]

### Debit and Credit Entries

In the double-entry system:
- **Debit (Dr)** typically increases asset and expense accounts but decreases liability, equity, and revenue accounts.
- **Credit (Cr)** generally increases liability, equity, and revenue accounts but diminishes asset and expense accounts.

Every transaction is recorded as a debit in one account and a credit in another, upholding the balance of the accounting equation.

## Role of General Ledger in Financial Reporting

The general ledger serves as the backbone of financial reporting. It facilitates the preparation of key financial statements that present the financial health of the company:

### Balance Sheet
The balance sheet is a snapshot of the company's financial position at a specific point in time, showing assets, liabilities, and equity.

### Income Statement
The income statement, also known as the profit and loss statement, summarizes revenues and expenses over a specific period, presenting the net profit or loss.

### Cash Flow Statement
The cash flow statement details the inflow and outflow of cash, classifying them into operating, investing, and financing activities.

### Statement of Changes in Equity
This statement documents the movements in equity over the period, including profits retained in the business and equity investments by shareholders.

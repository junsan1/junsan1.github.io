# General Ledger

A general ledger is a critical component of [accounting](../a/accounting.md) systems used by businesses. It is a comprehensive record of all financial transactions carried out by an organization during a specific period. This [accounting](../a/accounting.md) ledger provides an organized view of all the company's accounts and is used to produce key [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md), including the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) and [income statement](../i/income_statement.md).

## Structure and Components of a General Ledger

A standard general ledger is typically organized into sections based on [asset](../a/asset.md), [liability](../l/liability.md), [equity](../e/equity.md), [revenue](../r/revenue.md), and [expense](../e/expense.md) accounts. Each section includes specific accounts that capture various types of financial activities:

### 1. Asset Accounts
[Asset](../a/asset.md) accounts represent resources owned by the [business](../b/business.md) that have [economic value](../e/economic_value.md). Common [asset](../a/asset.md) accounts include:
- **Cash and [Cash Equivalents](../c/cash_equivalents.md)**: Includes [currency](../c/currency.md), [bank](../b/bank.md) balances, and other [liquid](../l/liquid.md) assets.
- **Accounts [Receivable](../r/receivable.md)**: [Money](../m/money.md) owed by customers for goods or services delivered.
- **[Inventory](../i/inventory.md)**: The [value](../v/value.md) of goods available for [sale](../s/sale.md).
- **Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E)**: [Long-term assets](../l/long-term_assets.md) such as buildings and machinery.

### 2. Liability Accounts
[Liability](../l/liability.md) accounts record the company's [obligations](../o/obligation.md) or debts. Key types include:
- **Accounts Payable**: [Money](../m/money.md) owed to suppliers for goods or services received.
- **Accrued Liabilities**: Expenses that have been incurred but not yet paid.
- **Loans Payable**: The outstanding amount of [money](../m/money.md) borrowed.
- **Bonds Payable**: [Long-term debt](../l/long-term_debt.md) issued by the company through bonds.

### 3. Equity Accounts
[Equity](../e/equity.md) accounts track the owner's or shareholders' residual [interest](../i/interest.md) in the [business](../b/business.md). Common [equity](../e/equity.md) accounts are:
- **[Common Stock](../c/common_stock.md)**: [Equity](../e/equity.md) investment by shareholders.
- **[Retained Earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md)**: Accumulated net [income](../i/income.md) not distributed to shareholders.
- **[Additional Paid-In Capital](../a/additional_paid-in_capital.md)**: Extra amount paid by shareholders over the [par value](../p/par_value.md) of the stock.

### 4. Revenue Accounts
[Revenue](../r/revenue.md) accounts capture the [income](../i/income.md) earned from [business](../b/business.md) operations. Types include:
- **Sales [Revenue](../r/revenue.md)**: [Income](../i/income.md) from selling goods or services.
- **Service [Revenue](../r/revenue.md)**: [Income](../i/income.md) from providing services.
- **[Interest](../i/interest.md) [Revenue](../r/revenue.md)**: [Income](../i/income.md) from [interest](../i/interest.md)-bearing accounts or investments.

### 5. Expense Accounts
[Expense](../e/expense.md) accounts record costs incurred in the course of [business](../b/business.md) operations. Notable categories include:
- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: Direct costs attributable to the [sale](../s/sale.md) of goods.
- **Salaries [Expense](../e/expense.md)**: Payments made to employees.
- **Rent [Expense](../e/expense.md)**: Costs for leasing spaces.
- **Utilities [Expense](../e/expense.md)**: Expenses for utilities like electricity and water.

## The Double-Entry System

The [underlying](../u/underlying.md) principle of general ledger [accounting](../a/accounting.md) is the double-entry system, which ensures that every financial [transaction](../t/transaction.md) has equal and opposite effects in at least two different accounts. This system maintains the [accounting equation](../a/accounting_equation.md):
\[ \text{Assets} = \text{Liabilities} + \text{[Equity](../e/equity.md)} \]

### Debit and Credit Entries

In the double-entry system:
- **[Debit](../d/debit.md) (Dr)** typically increases [asset](../a/asset.md) and [expense](../e/expense.md) accounts but decreases [liability](../l/liability.md), [equity](../e/equity.md), and [revenue](../r/revenue.md) accounts.
- **[Credit](../c/credit.md) (Cr)** generally increases [liability](../l/liability.md), [equity](../e/equity.md), and [revenue](../r/revenue.md) accounts but diminishes [asset](../a/asset.md) and [expense](../e/expense.md) accounts.

Every [transaction](../t/transaction.md) is recorded as a [debit](../d/debit.md) in one account and a [credit](../c/credit.md) in another, upholding the balance of the [accounting equation](../a/accounting_equation.md).

## Role of General Ledger in Financial Reporting

The general ledger serves as the backbone of financial reporting. It facilitates the preparation of key [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) that present the [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) of the company:

### Balance Sheet
The [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) is a snapshot of the company's financial position at a specific point in time, showing assets, liabilities, and [equity](../e/equity.md).

### Income Statement
The [income statement](../i/income_statement.md), also known as the [profit](../p/profit.md) and loss statement, summarizes revenues and expenses over a specific period, presenting the net [profit](../p/profit.md) or loss.

### Cash Flow Statement
The [cash flow statement](../c/cash_flow_statement.md) details the inflow and outflow of cash, classifying them into operating, [investing](../i/investing.md), and [financing](../f/financing.md) activities.

### Statement of Changes in Equity
This statement documents the movements in [equity](../e/equity.md) over the period, including profits retained in the [business](../b/business.md) and [equity](../e/equity.md) investments by shareholders.

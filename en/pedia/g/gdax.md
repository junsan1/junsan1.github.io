# GDAX
  
GDAX, short for Global Digital [Asset](../a/asset.md) [Exchange](../e/exchange.md), was a cryptocurrency [exchange](../e/exchange.md) that allowed users to buy, sell, and [trade](../t/trade.md) cryptocurrencies. GDAX was created by [Coinbase](../c/coinbase.md) in 2015 and later rebranded as [Coinbase](../c/coinbase.md) Pro in 2018. The platform provided various features aimed at both new and experienced traders, and it supported [multiple](../m/multiple.md) digital assets. GDAX was widely known for its advanced trading features, [security](../s/security.md) measures, and integration with the larger [Coinbase](../c/coinbase.md) ecosystem.
  
## Background and History

GDAX was launched by [Coinbase](../c/coinbase.md), one of the most prominent cryptocurrency platforms in the world, to give users a more advanced trading experience. Initially designed for professionals and institutions, GDAX offered advanced trading functionalities like limit orders, stop orders, and [margin trading](../m/margin_trading.md), setting it apart from similarly focused but simpler platforms.

### Founding and Development

Founded by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam in 2012, [Coinbase](../c/coinbase.md)'s mission was to make [digital currency](../d/digital_currency.md) accessible to everyone. Initially, [Coinbase](../c/coinbase.md) allowed users to buy and sell [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md), but it soon expanded its portfolio to include other cryptocurrencies. Recognizing the need for a more [robust](../r/robust.md) [trading platform](../t/trading_platform.md) for advanced users, [Coinbase](../c/coinbase.md) launched GDAX in May 2015. 

GDAX was built to meet the needs of more sophisticated traders by providing tools for in-depth [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md), detailed [market](../m/market.md) data, and other advanced trading features.

## Features

### Trading Interface

GDAX was designed to [offer](../o/offer.md) an intuitive yet feature-rich trading experience. The platform provided a [range](../r/range.md) of trading pairs, including [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) (BTC), [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and later, other digital assets. The trading interface included:

- **[Order Book](../o/order_book.md):** Real-time display of buy and sell orders.

- **Limit Orders:** Buy or sell at a specific price or better.
- **Stop Orders:** Automatically execute a buy or sell [order](../o/order.md) when the price reaches a specified trigger point.

### Margin Trading

One of the standout features of GDAX was its [margin trading](../m/margin_trading.md) capability, allowing users to borrow funds to [trade](../t/trade.md) larger positions than their account balances would otherwise permit. This feature was particularly appealing for professional traders seeking higher returns through leveraged trading.

### API Access

GDAX also offered extensive API (Application Programming Interface) access, enabling algorithmic traders and developers to integrate the [trading platform](../t/trading_platform.md) into their systems. The API provided endpoints for retrieving [market](../m/market.md) data, placing orders, and managing accounts, making it highly customizable for various [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

### Security Measures

[Security](../s/security.md) was a major focal point for GDAX. The platform employed several layers of [security](../s/security.md) to protect user funds and data. These included:

- **Two-[Factor](../f/factor.md) Authentication (2FA):** Enhanced [security](../s/security.md) for user accounts.
- **Cold Storage:** Majority of digital assets stored offline.
- **Encryption:** Sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Adherence to legal and regulatory requirements, including Know Your [Customer](../c/customer.md) (KYC) and Anti-[Money Laundering](../m/money_laundering.md) (AML) protocols.

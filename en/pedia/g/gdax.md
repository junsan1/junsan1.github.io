# GDAX
  
GDAX, short for Global Digital Asset Exchange, was a cryptocurrency exchange that allowed users to buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies. GDAX was created by Coinbase in 2015 and later rebranded as Coinbase Pro in 2018. The platform provided various features aimed at both new and experienced traders, and it supported multiple digital assets. GDAX was widely known for its advanced trading features, security measures, and integration with the larger Coinbase ecosystem.
  
## Background and History

GDAX was launched by Coinbase, one of the most prominent cryptocurrency platforms in the world, to give users a more advanced trading experience. Initially designed for professionals and institutions, GDAX offered advanced trading functionalities like limit orders, stop orders, and margin trading, setting it apart from similarly focused but simpler platforms.

### Founding and Development

Founded by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam in 2012, Coinbase's mission was to make digital currency accessible to everyone. Initially, Coinbase allowed users to buy and sell Bitcoin, but it soon expanded its portfolio to include other cryptocurrencies. Recognizing the need for a more robust trading platform for advanced users, Coinbase launched GDAX in May 2015. 

GDAX was built to meet the needs of more sophisticated traders by providing tools for in-depth technical analysis, detailed market data, and other advanced trading features.

## Features

### Trading Interface

GDAX was designed to offer an intuitive yet feature-rich trading experience. The platform provided a range of trading pairs, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and later, other digital assets. The trading interface included:

- **Order Book:** Real-time display of buy and sell orders.
- **Trade History:** A record of previously executed trades.
- **Price Chart:** Advanced charting tools for technical analysis.
- **Order Form:** A form to place market, limit, and stop orders.

### Order Types

GDAX supported multiple types of orders to give traders better control over their trades:

- **Market Orders:** Buy or sell at the current market price.
- **Limit Orders:** Buy or sell at a specific price or better.
- **Stop Orders:** Automatically execute a buy or sell order when the price reaches a specified trigger point.

### Margin Trading

One of the standout features of GDAX was its margin trading capability, allowing users to borrow funds to trade larger positions than their account balances would otherwise permit. This feature was particularly appealing for professional traders seeking higher returns through leveraged trading.

### API Access

GDAX also offered extensive API (Application Programming Interface) access, enabling algorithmic traders and developers to integrate the trading platform into their systems. The API provided endpoints for retrieving market data, placing orders, and managing accounts, making it highly customizable for various trading strategies.

### Security Measures

Security was a major focal point for GDAX. The platform employed several layers of security to protect user funds and data. These included:

- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Enhanced security for user accounts.
- **Cold Storage:** Majority of digital assets stored offline.
- **Encryption:** Sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Adherence to legal and regulatory requirements, including Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols.

## Rebranding as Coinbase Pro

In May 2018, Coinbase announced that GDAX would be rebranded as Coinbase Pro. The transition aimed to unify Coinbase's brand and offer a more seamless experience across its products. Along with the rebrand, several new features and enhancements were introduced, including a new user interface and additional trading pairs.

## Impact and Legacy

GDAX was instrumental in establishing Coinbase as a major player in the cryptocurrency trading world. By offering a sophisticated trading platform, Coinbase could cater to both retail and institutional investors. The success of GDAX also paved the way for the launch of new products and services within the Coinbase ecosystem, including custody solutions and institutional services.

GDAX's legacy continues under the Coinbase Pro banner, which maintains its predecessorâ€™s focus on advanced trading features while further integrating into Coinbase's overall mission to create an open financial system for the world.

## Conclusion

GDAX played a crucial role in the evolution of cryptocurrency trading platforms. With its advanced features, robust security, and seamless integration with Coinbase, it set a standard for what professional trading platforms should be. The transition to Coinbase Pro marked a new chapter in its development, ensuring that GDAX's legacy would continue to influence the cryptocurrency trading industry.

# Gibraltar Pound (GIP)

The Gibraltar Pound (GIP) is the official currency of Gibraltar, a British Overseas Territory located at the southern tip of the Iberian Peninsula. While Gibraltar uses the pound sterling interchangeably with the GIP, the latter is a distinct currency issued by the Government of Gibraltar. The Gibraltar economy is deeply intertwined with its monetary system, making an understanding of the GIP essential for comprehending the broader economic landscape of the territory.

### Exchange and Usage

The GIP is accepted throughout Gibraltar alongside the British Pound. Given its peg to the GBP, foreign exchange between the two currencies involves no transactional cost, which simplifies financial activities for residents and businesses in Gibraltar. However, outside of Gibraltar, many institutions may hesitate to accept or exchange GIP directly, opting instead for the well-recognized GBP.

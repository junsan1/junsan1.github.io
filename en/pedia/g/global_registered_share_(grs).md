# Global Registered Share (GRS)

The concept of a Global Registered Share (GRS) emerges from the need for financial instruments that can be traded and settled across [multiple](../m/multiple.md) markets without the complexities and barriers traditionally associated with cross-border securities transactions. GRSs are designed to be globally fungible, meaning that they can be traded on various stock exchanges around the world but remain a single unified entity in the eyes of regulatory and operational frameworks.

## Overview

Global Registered [Shares](../s/shares.md) represent an evolution in the way companies structure their equities to be more accessible to international investors. Traditional methods for facilitating [cross-border trading](../c/cross-border_trading.md), such as American [Depository](../d/depository.md) [Receipts](../r/receipt.md) (ADRs) or Global [Depository](../d/depository.md) [Receipts](../r/receipt.md) (GDRs), involve intermediary banks and complex structures that often lead to inefficiencies and higher costs. In contrast, GRSs simplify this process by being identical [shares](../s/shares.md) that can be traded in [multiple](../m/multiple.md) jurisdictions through local depositories without any need for conversion or the involvement of third parties.

## Mechanics and Structure

A Global Registered Share operates by having a single [share class](../s/share_class.md) [listed](../l/listed.md) on [multiple](../m/multiple.md) stock exchanges. Each GRS is registered in [multiple](../m/multiple.md) markets, but the [shares](../s/shares.md) themselves are identical, enabling seamless trading and settlement. For instance, a company might list GRSs on both the New York Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (NYSE) and the London Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (LSE). Investors in the United States and the United Kingdom can buy and sell these [shares](../s/shares.md), which [will](../w/will.md) settle in their respective local markets but maintain a unified share registry.

### Issuance

The issuance of GRSs involves several key steps:

1. **Legal Framework**: Establishing a legal framework where the securities laws of different jurisdictions are reconciled to allow a single share to be recognized and tradable in [multiple](../m/multiple.md) markets.
2. **Depositories and Custodians**: Working with central securities depositories (CSDs) and custodians to ensure the [shares](../s/shares.md) can be electronically transferred and settled in various markets.
3. **[Corporate Governance](../c/corporate_governance.md)**: Implementing [robust](../r/robust.md) [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) structures that comply with the regulatory requirements of all listing jurisdictions.

### Listing Process

When listing GRSs, companies must comply with the listing rules of each [exchange](../e/exchange.md), which can include disclosures, financial reporting, and [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) requirements. The advantage of GRSs is that once these are satisfied, the [shares](../s/shares.md) can be freely traded across these markets without the need for conversion between different instruments.

## Benefits

### For Issuers

1. **Increased [Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)**: By [offering](../o/offering.md) [shares](../s/shares.md) in [multiple](../m/multiple.md) markets, issuers can tap into a broader base of potential investors, increasing the overall [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) of their stock.
2. **Global Reach**: Companies get access to international [capital](../c/capital.md) without having to maintain [multiple](../m/multiple.md) classes of [shares](../s/shares.md) or complex [depository](../d/depository.md) [receipts](../r/receipt.md) systems.
3. **Simplified Administration**: Less administrative burden compared to managing ADR or GDR programs, leading to cost savings and operational efficiencies.

### For Investors

1. **Ease of Access**: Investors can buy and sell GRSs in their local [market](../m/market.md) and [currency](../c/currency.md), reducing the complexities and costs associated with cross-border investment.
2. **Price [Parity](../p/parity.md)**: GRSs help maintain price [parity](../p/parity.md) across markets, ensuring that investors pay the same price regardless of the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) they [trade](../t/trade.md) on.
3. **Transparent Ownership**: Direct ownership of [shares](../s/shares.md) rather than [derivative](../d/derivative.md) instruments like ADRs provides better [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and voting rights.

## Challenges

Despite the advantages, GRSs also come with challenges:

1. **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensuring ongoing compliance with the varied regulatory requirements of [multiple](../m/multiple.md) jurisdictions can be complex and resource-intensive.
2. **[Market](../m/market.md) Differences**: Differences in [market](../m/market.md) practices, trading hours, and settlement cycles between exchanges can create operational hurdles.
3. **[Currency](../c/currency.md) [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: While trading in local currencies simplifies access for investors, issuers must manage the associated [currency](../c/currency.md) [risk](../r/risk.md), particularly if their revenues and expenses are primarily in a different [currency](../c/currency.md).

## Case Studies

### Daimler AG

Daimler AG was one of the pioneers in adopting the GRS structure. The company announced its plan to switch from a traditional [depository](../d/depository.md) receipt program to a GRS structure to simplify its [equity](../e/equity.md) structure and improve marketability. You can learn more about their implementation of GRSs on their [official website](https://www.daimler.com/investors/stock/share/).

### Deutsche Bank

Deutsche [Bank](../b/bank.md) also adopted the GRS structure for similar reasons, striving for greater appeal to international investors and enhanced [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md). More details about their GRS implementation can be found on their [official investor relations page](https://investor-relations.db.com/).

## Conclusion

Global Registered [Shares](../s/shares.md) (GRS) represent a significant innovation in the way companies raise [capital](../c/capital.md) and engage with international investors. By streamlining the process of [cross-border trading](../c/cross-border_trading.md) and simplifying administrative burdens, GRSs [offer](../o/offer.md) a compelling alternative to traditional methods like ADRs and GDRs. As global markets become increasingly interconnected, the adoption of GRSs is likely to grow, [offering](../o/offering.md) benefits to both issuers and investors. However, the complexities of regulatory compliance and [market](../m/market.md) integration mean that GRSs are most suitable for companies with the resources to navigate these challenges effectively.

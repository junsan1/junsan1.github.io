# Government-Sponsored Enterprise

A Government-Sponsored Enterprise (GSE) is a financial services [corporation](../c/corporation.md) created by Congress with the aim of enhancing the flow of [credit](../c/credit.md) to specific sectors of the [economy](../e/economy.md) and addressing perceived shortages of [credit](../c/credit.md) and [market](../m/market.md) imperfections. GSEs are privately-held entities, yet they benefit from various government support mechanisms which make them distinctive compared to purely private enterprises.

## History and Purpose

The concept of GSEs began during the [Great Depression](../g/great_depression.md) as the U.S. government sought ways to stabilize [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and expand access to homeownership, agriculture, and education loans. By providing a government-backed entity to support these markets, Congress hoped to ensure a steady, reliable source of funding for critical areas of the [economy](../e/economy.md), minimizing the likelihood of shortages which could impede [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md).

## Structure and Function

GSEs typically operate in specific economic sectors, and their primary role is to enhance the availability and lower the cost of [credit](../c/credit.md). Although they are privately incorporated, their establishment and operation are driven by statutory mandates to fulfill public policy goals. They work by purchasing loans from lenders, thus enabling more lending within the [economy](../e/economy.md). This [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md) activity provides [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), stability, and reduces the [risk](../r/risk.md) for primary lenders.

### Characteristics of GSEs
Some defining characteristics of GSEs include:
- They are created by Congress through a legislative act.
- They have public policy mandates specified in their charters.
- They enjoy certain benefits as a result of their federal affiliation.
- They aim to promote access to [credit](../c/credit.md) in particular markets including housing, agriculture, and education.

## Prominent Examples of GSEs

### Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae)
Fannie Mae was created in 1938 to expand the secondary [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [market](../m/market.md) by securitizing mortgages using [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-backed securities (MBS), thereby allowing lenders to reinvest their assets into more lending. This [securitization](../s/securitization.md) also allows institutions to mitigate [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) lending.

### Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac)
[Freddie Mac](../f/freddie_mac.md) was established in 1970 to further support the secondary [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [market](../m/market.md) and to reduce the [risk](../r/risk.md) to lenders by purchasing residential mortgages, packaging them into MBS, and selling them to investors. Both Fannie Mae and [Freddie Mac](../f/freddie_mac.md) aim to improve housing [finance](../f/finance.md) stability and affordability.

### Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBanks)
The network of regional FHLBanks, founded in 1932, provides reliable funding to American financial institutions (notably community banks) to support [home mortgage](../h/home_mortgage.md) lending, small [business](../b/business.md) loans, disaster relief, and rural development. The FHLBanks play a crucial role in maintaining [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) in the local banking system.

### Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (Farmer Mac)
Farmer Mac, created in 1988, enhances the availability of farm and rural [credit](../c/credit.md) by purchasing eligible loans and creating securities backed by them. It provides a [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md) for agricultural loans, similar to how Fannie Mae and [Freddie Mac](../f/freddie_mac.md) operate in the housing [market](../m/market.md).

### Student Loan Marketing Association (Sallie Mae)
Originally established in 1972 as a GSE, Sallie Mae was privatized in 2004 but continues to affect the student [loan](../l/loan.md) [market](../m/market.md), primarily through servicing and collection of education loans. Its transition from GSE to a private entity reflects the changing approach to managing and [financing](../f/financing.md) student loans.

## Implications and Controversies

### Market Benefits
GSEs have historically made significant contributions to the U.S. [economy](../e/economy.md) by ensuring the availability of [credit](../c/credit.md) in essential areas. They provide [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and stability, improve access to [capital](../c/capital.md), promote homeownership, support the agricultural sector, and facilitate access to education through student loans.

### Risks and Criticisms
GSEs also face several criticisms and challenges. They operate under a perception of implicit government backing, which can lead to [moral hazard](../m/moral_hazard.md), where the entities might engage in riskier behavior under the assumption of government support during crises. Moreover, their private [profit](../p/profit.md) motives can sometimes clash with their public policy objectives, causing tension and inefficiencies.

### Financial Crisis Insight
The involvement of Fannie Mae and [Freddie Mac](../f/freddie_mac.md) in the 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) highlighted significant risks associated with GSEs. Their heavy involvement in [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-backed securities [market](../m/market.md), including subprime loans, contributed to systemic financial instability. Post-crisis, both entities were placed under conservatorship by the Federal Housing [Finance](../f/finance.md) Agency (FHFA) to stabilize their operations and protect broader financial [market](../m/market.md) interests.

## Regulation and Oversight

GSEs are subject to various levels of oversight and regulation, often involving a mix of federal and state authorities depending on the entity. The primary regulator for housing GSEs such as Fannie Mae and [Freddie Mac](../f/freddie_mac.md) is the FHFA, which oversees their safety, soundness, and mission compliance.

### Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA)
The FHFA was established in 2008 to provide oversight and regulatory control over the housing GSEs. It ensures they operate safely and soundly within their legislative mandates, maintain sufficient [capital](../c/capital.md) levels, and adhere to proper [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices.

### Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO)
Prior to the establishment of FHFA, the oversight of Fannie Mae and [Freddie Mac](../f/freddie_mac.md) was the responsibility of the OFHEO. Post-2008 reforms consolidated these functions within the FHFA to streamline and enhance regulatory [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md).

## Modern Reforms and Future Directions

In response to the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) and subsequent economic challenges, significant reforms and discussions continue regarding the future structure and role of GSEs.

### Conservatorship and Financial Performance
Since 2008, Fannie Mae and [Freddie Mac](../f/freddie_mac.md) have operated under conservatorship, which means they are managed by the FHFA to protect the assets of the enterprises and ensure their continued support for the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [market](../m/market.md). Their [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) has since improved, but debates persist about permanent solutions and the potential for [privatization](../p/privatization.md) or further government intervention.

### Legislative Proposals
Various legislative proposals have been introduced in Congress to enhance the stability and functionality of GSEs. Proposals generally focus on reducing [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) [risk](../r/risk.md), improving [capital](../c/capital.md) standards, promoting affordable housing, and fostering competition in the housing [finance](../f/finance.md) [market](../m/market.md). Success in passing such reforms has been limited by the complexity and diverse [stakeholder](../s/stakeholder.md) interests.

### Potential of Privatization
Reforming or privatizing GSEs is a widely debated topic. Proponents argue that [privatization](../p/privatization.md) could reduce [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) [risk](../r/risk.md) and foster a more competitive and efficient [market](../m/market.md). Conversely, critics warn that it might limit the availability of [credit](../c/credit.md) for critical sectors and undermine public policy goals aimed at supporting homeownership and affordability.

## Conclusion

Government-Sponsored Enterprises play a pivotal role in the U.S. [economy](../e/economy.md) by enhancing access to [credit](../c/credit.md) across key sectors. While they have contributed significantly to [market](../m/market.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), stability, and affordability, they also present ongoing regulatory challenges and risks. Balancing their public policy mandates with financial stability and [market efficiency](../m/market_efficiency.md) continues to be a dynamic and evolving process crucial to the broader economic landscape.

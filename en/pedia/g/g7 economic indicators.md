# G7 Economic Indicators

The Group of Seven (G7) is an organization of seven of the world's largest advanced economies: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. These countries represent significant portions of the global economy, and their economic indicators are closely watched by investors, policymakers, and economists worldwide. Understanding G7 economic indicators is crucial for grasping the broader economic health and trends that influence global markets. 

## GDP (Gross Domestic Product)

GDP measures the total value of all goods and services produced in a country over a specific period and is a key indicator of economic health. It is commonly expressed in terms of the annual growth rate. For G7 countries, GDP data can signal economic growth or recession and is used by policymakers to formulate fiscal and monetary policies.

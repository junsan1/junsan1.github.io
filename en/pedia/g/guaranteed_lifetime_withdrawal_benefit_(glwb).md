# Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit (GLWB)

A Guaranteed Lifetime [Withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) Benefit (GLWB) is a feature often offered with variable annuities or fixed indexed annuities that provides a consistent and predictable [income](../i/income.md) stream to the [annuitant](../a/annuitant.md) for the [duration](../d/duration.md) of their life, regardless of [market](../m/market.md) conditions or performance of [underlying](../u/underlying.md) investments. This benefit is particularly attractive for retirees who seek a dependable source of [income](../i/income.md) during their retirement years.

## How GLWB Works

### Initial Setup

When an individual purchases an annuity with a GLWB option, they typically designate a portion of their retirement savings to the annuity contract. The GLWB feature may come with an additional [fee](../f/fee.md), which is deducted annually from the annuity's [value](../v/value.md).

### Accumulation Phase

During the [accumulation phase](../a/accumulation_phase.md), the invested amount may grow based on the performance of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) investments for variable annuities or the crediting strategy for fixed indexed annuities. Even though the GLWB benefit is primarily focused on [income](../i/income.md) during retirement, this phase is crucial as it can affect the initial calculation of guaranteed withdrawals.

### Benefit Base Calculation

The benefit base is a theoretical [value](../v/value.md) used to determine the amount of guaranteed annual withdrawals. It is usually distinct from the actual account [value](../v/value.md) (also known as the "cash [value](../v/value.md)"). The benefit base may increase through either:

- **Guaranteed Roll-Ups**: A fixed percentage (often around 5-7%) added each year to the benefit base during the deferral period, regardless of [market](../m/market.md) performance.
- **[Premium](../p/premium.md) Bonuses**: Additional amounts credited to the benefit base when the initial annuity is purchased, typically as a percentage of the [premium](../p/premium.md) paid.

### Withdrawal Phase

Once withdrawals begin, the [annuitant](../a/annuitant.md) is entitled to receive periodic (often annual or monthly) payments at a pre-determined rate, specified as a percentage of the benefit base (commonly around 4-6%). These payments are guaranteed for life, even if the actual account [value](../v/value.md) is depleted.

## Key Features and Considerations

### Longevity Protection

The primary advantage of a GLWB is providing financial longevity protection, ensuring the [annuitant](../a/annuitant.md) receives consistent payments throughout their lifetime, which shields them against the [risk](../r/risk.md) of outliving their savings.

### Flexibility and Control

Some GLWB products [offer](../o/offer.md) the flexibility to take larger amounts occasionally, though this might adjust future guaranteed [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) amounts. Additionally, the [annuitant](../a/annuitant.md) typically retains control over the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) investments in a [variable annuity](../v/variable_annuity.md), allowing for potential [market](../m/market.md) gains.

### Death Benefits

GLWB contracts often include provisions for a [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md), ensuring that if the [annuitant](../a/annuitant.md) passes away before exhausting the account [value](../v/value.md), any remaining funds are paid to beneficiaries.

### Cost of GLWB

The cost of including a GLWB in an annuity contract can vary but generally includes:

- **[Rider](../r/rider.md) Fees**: An ongoing annual [fee](../f/fee.md), usually a percentage of the benefit base.
- **Reduced Growth Potential**: The guaranteed [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) feature may come with conservative investment restrictions to ensure the guarantee can be met.

### Surrender Charges and Restrictions

Withdrawing amounts exceeding the guaranteed [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) limit or surrendering the annuity may incur charges. Detailed terms vary by provider, and it is essential for potential annuitants to examine these conditions carefully.

## Examples of GLWB in Action

### Scenario A: Steady Growth

1. **Initial Purchase**: A retiree, John, buys a [variable annuity](../v/variable_annuity.md) with a GLWB feature for $100,000.
2. **[Accumulation Phase](../a/accumulation_phase.md)**: Over 10 years, the benefit base grows at a guaranteed roll-up rate of 6% annually, making it $179,000.
3. **[Withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) Phase**: John starts [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) at a guaranteed rate of 5%, receiving $8,950 annually for life.

### Scenario B: Market Volatility

1. **Initial Purchase**: Emily invests $200,000 in a fixed [indexed annuity](../i/indexed_annuity.md) with a GLWB during a volatile [market](../m/market.md).
2. **[Accumulation Phase](../a/accumulation_phase.md)**: The benefit base grows with a mix of [premium](../p/premium.md) bonuses and guaranteed roll-ups to $320,000 over 10 years.
3. **[Withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) Phase**: Despite [market](../m/market.md) downturns depleting the actual account [value](../v/value.md), Emily withdraws 5% of the benefit base, receiving $16,000 yearly, guaranteed for life.

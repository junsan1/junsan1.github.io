# Growth Investing Strategies

[Growth investing](../g/growth_investing.md) is a popular investment strategy focused on identifying companies or stocks that exhibit signs of above-average growth, even if the share price appears expensive in terms of metrics such as price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios. Growth investors typically seek out companies that are expected to grow at an above-average rate compared to other companies in the market. The primary objective of [growth investing](../g/growth_investing.md) is capital appreciation—a gain in the value of the investment over time.

Growth companies often reinvest their earnings back into their business to fuel further growth. This strategy contrasts with [value investing](../v/value_investing.md), which focuses on buying undervalued stocks that appear attractive according to fundamental metrics.

## Key Characteristics of Growth Stocks

[Growth stocks](../g/growth_stocks.md) usually exhibit several common characteristics:

1. **High Revenue and Earnings Growth:** These companies often show substantial year-over-year increases in revenue and earnings.
2. **Innovative Products or Services:** They frequently offer cutting-edge products, services, or technologies that are expected to dominate or revolutionize their respective markets.
3. **Market Leadership:** Growth companies often have a leading position within their industries, evidenced by a significant market share.
4. **High P/E Ratios:** Due to high expectations for future growth, these companies typically trade at high P/E ratios.
5. **Low Dividend Yields:** Growth companies often reinvest earnings to facilitate further growth rather than distribute them as dividends to shareholders.

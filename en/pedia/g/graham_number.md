# Graham Number

The Graham Number is a financial metric used to determine the [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) of a stock. It was derived by [Benjamin Graham](../b/benjamin_graham.md), who is often referred to as the father of [value investing](../v/value_investing.md). Graham's investment philosophy focused on purchasing [stocks](../s/stock.md) that were [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) by the [market](../m/market.md) but possessed strong fundamentals. The Graham Number helps to identify such [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md).

## Definition and Formula

The Graham Number is calculated using the following formula:

```
Graham Number = sqrt(22.5 * [Earnings](../e/earnings.md) Per Share (EPS) * [Book Value](../b/book_value.md) Per Share (BVPS))
```

Where:
- `[Earnings](../e/earnings.md) Per Share (EPS)` refers to the company's [profit](../p/profit.md) divided by the number of outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md).
- `[Book Value](../b/book_value.md) Per Share (BVPS)` is the net [asset](../a/asset.md) [value](../v/value.md) of the company divided by the number of outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md).

The [multiplier](../m/multiplier.md) 22.5 in the equation comes from Graham's criteria that the Price-to-[Earnings](../e/earnings.md) (P/E) ratio should not exceed 15 and the Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio should not exceed 1.5. Multiplying these two values gives us 22.5, which is used in the formula.

## Purpose and Importance

The Graham Number serves as a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) to assess whether a stock is trading below its [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md). If the stock's current [market price](../m/market_price.md) is below the Graham Number, the stock may be considered [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) and potentially a good investment opportunity. Conversely, if the [market price](../m/market_price.md) is above the Graham Number, the stock might be [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md).

### Example Calculation

Let's consider a hypothetical company with the following financial metrics:
- [Earnings](../e/earnings.md) Per Share (EPS): $5
- [Book Value](../b/book_value.md) Per Share (BVPS): $40

Using the Graham Number formula:

```
Graham Number = sqrt(22.5 * 5 * 40)
              = sqrt(22.5 * 200)
              = sqrt(4500)
              = 67.08
```

If the stock's current [market price](../m/market_price.md) is $60, it would be considered [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) relative to its Graham Number [value](../v/value.md) of $67.08. 

## Limitations

While the Graham Number is a useful tool, it is not without limitations:

1. **Static Calculation**: The formula uses historical EPS and BVPS, which may not accurately reflect future company performance.
2. **Ignoring Growth**: The Graham Number does not account for growth potential, which could mean undervaluing high-growth companies.
3. **[Industry](../i/industry.md)-Specific**: Different industries have different P/E and P/B norms; the Graham Number may not be equally applicable across diverse sectors.

## Practical Application

### Screening Stocks

Investors often use the Graham Number as part of a stock screening process to identify potentially [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md). Several financial websites and platforms [offer](../o/offer.md) pre-calculated Graham Numbers for many publicly traded companies, making this process easier.

### Portfolio Management

[Value](../v/value.md) investors might incorporate the Graham Number into their [portfolio management](../p/par.md) strategy to ensure they are [investing](../i/investing.md) in [stocks](../s/stock.md) that meet their [valuation](../v/valuation.md) criteria. This can help in making more objective investment decisions based on [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md) rather than [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md).

### Risk Management

By focusing on [stocks](../s/stock.md) trading below their Graham Number, investors can potentially reduce their [downside risk](../d/downside_risk.md). Purchasing [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) provides a [margin of safety](../m/margin_of_safety.md), which is a core principle of [value investing](../v/value_investing.md). The assumption is that the [market](../m/market.md) [will](../w/will.md) eventually recognize the stock's true [value](../v/value.md), leading to price appreciation.

## Case Studies

### Apple's Graham Number

For example, let's calculate the Graham Number for Apple Inc. (AAPL) using their financial data as of the most recent fiscal year:
- [Earnings](../e/earnings.md) Per Share (EPS): $5.61
- [Book Value](../b/book_value.md) Per Share (BVPS): $3.85

```
Graham Number = sqrt(22.5 * 5.61 * 3.85)
              = sqrt(22.5 * 21.5985)
              = sqrt(485.965125)
              = 22.05
```

If Apple's current [market price](../m/market_price.md) is $150, it is significantly higher than its Graham Number of $22.05, suggesting that it might be [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md) according to this metric.

### Amazon's Graham Number

As another example, consider Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) with the following data:
- [Earnings](../e/earnings.md) Per Share (EPS): $42.64
- [Book Value](../b/book_value.md) Per Share (BVPS): $211.61

```
Graham Number = sqrt(22.5 * 42.64 * 211.61)
              = sqrt(22.5 * 9021.3504)
              = sqrt(202980.384)
              = 450.53
```

If Amazonâ€™s [market price](../m/market_price.md) is $3,200, it is far above its Graham Number of $450.53, indicating potential overvaluation.

## Conclusion

The Graham Number is a simplistic yet powerful tool for [value](../v/value.md) investors seeking to identify [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md). It simplifies the complex task of stock [valuation](../v/valuation.md) into a single, quantifiable metric that can be used to make informed investment decisions. However, it is essential to use the Graham Number in conjunction with other [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md) tools and considerations to ensure a comprehensive understanding of a stock's [value](../v/value.md). Despite its limitations, the Graham Number remains a testament to [Benjamin Graham](../b/benjamin_graham.md)'s enduring influence on the art and science of investment.

# Guaranteed Investment Fund (GIF)

## Introduction

A Guaranteed [Investment Fund](../i/investment_fund.md) (GIF), also known as a Segregated [Fund](../f/fund.md), is a type of investment that combines the growth potential of investment funds with the [security](../s/security.md) of [insurance](../i/insurance.md) products. These funds are mostly offered by [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies and [offer](../o/offer.md) unique benefits that aren't typically available with traditional mutual funds or ETFs, such as [capital](../c/capital.md) guarantees and potential [creditor](../c/creditor.md) protection. Due to these distinct features, they [hold](../h/hold.md) a special position in the broader landscape of investment [options](../o/options.md).

## How Guaranteed Investment Funds Work

### 1. Fund Structure

GIFs are structured as [insurance](../i/insurance.md) contracts that [offer](../o/offer.md) investment possibilities. When an [investor](../i/investor.md) buys a GIF, they are essentially purchasing a [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policy that has investment components. The [money](../m/money.md) is then allocated into a [fund](../f/fund.md), which aims for growth based on the performance of [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assetsâ€”such as [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, and other securities.

### 2. Capital Guarantees

One of the most significant advantages of GIFs is the [capital](../c/capital.md) guarantee. Generally, these guarantees [range](../r/range.md) between 75% to 100% of the original investment, available either upon [maturity](../m/maturity.md) of the [fund](../f/fund.md) term or upon the death of the [investor](../i/investor.md). This means that even if the [market](../m/market.md) crashes, the [investor](../i/investor.md) is guaranteed to get back at least a portion of their initial investment.

### 3. Maturity and Death Benefits

GIFs [offer](../o/offer.md) two types of guarantees:

- **[Maturity](../m/maturity.md) Guarantee:** This is usually set at a certain period, like 10 or 15 years. Upon reaching [maturity](../m/maturity.md), the [investor](../i/investor.md) is guaranteed to receive at least a certain percentage (usually 75-100%) of their initial investment.
- **[Death Benefit](../d/death_benefit.md):** If the [investor](../i/investor.md) passes away, the beneficiaries are guaranteed to receive at least a certain percentage of the original investment, [offering](../o/offering.md) a safety net in case of untimely death.

### 4. Creditor Protection

GIFs are largely considered to be [insurance](../i/insurance.md) products, which means, in many jurisdictions, they can [offer](../o/offer.md) [creditor](../c/creditor.md) protection. If an [investor](../i/investor.md) declares [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md), the funds in the GIF might not be accessible to creditors, [offering](../o/offering.md) an additional layer of financial [security](../s/security.md).

### 5. Reset Options

Many GIFs [offer](../o/offer.md) a reset feature that allows the [investor](../i/investor.md) to lock in the current [market value](../m/market_value.md) of the investment as the new guaranteed amount. For example, if an [investor](../i/investor.md)'s [fund](../f/fund.md) grows significantly, they can use the reset option to solidify the [capital](../c/capital.md) guarantee at a higher amount, thus perpetuating their gains even if the [market](../m/market.md) falls subsequently.

### 6. Fees and Charges

While GIFs [offer](../o/offer.md) [multiple](../m/multiple.md) benefits, they come with fees that are generally higher than those for mutual funds or ETFs. These may include management fees, [insurance](../i/insurance.md) fees, and other administrative charges. The [trade](../t/trade.md)-off is the additional [security](../s/security.md) features and guarantees.

## Types of Guaranteed Investment Funds

### 1. Individual Variable Insurance Contracts (IVICs)

These are the most common type of GIFs and [offer](../o/offer.md) various investment [options](../o/options.md) that include [equity](../e/equity.md) funds, [bond](../b/bond.md) funds, and balanced funds.

### 2. Capital Guaranteed Products

These are often structured products that [offer](../o/offer.md) 100% [capital](../c/capital.md) protection and are typically geared toward conservative investors.

### 3. Retirement and Income GIFs

These specialized GIFs often focus on providing a steady [income](../i/income.md) in retirement, sometimes combining annuity features.

## Risks and Considerations

### 1. Market Risk
While GIFs [offer](../o/offer.md) [capital](../c/capital.md) guarantees, the returns are still subject to [market](../m/market.md) performance. The guarantees often apply only at [maturity](../m/maturity.md) or on death, so investors could see lower interim valuations.

### 2. Fees
The higher fees associated with GIFs can eat into returns over the long term. 

### 3. Liquidity
GIFs can have restrictions on withdrawals and may impose penalties for early [redemption](../r/redemption.md).

### 4. Regulatory Environment
Regulations governing GIFs can vary by jurisdiction, affecting things like tax treatment and [creditor](../c/creditor.md) protection.

## Conclusion

Guaranteed Investment Funds [offer](../o/offer.md) a unique blend of investment growth potential with the safety features typical of [insurance](../i/insurance.md) products. This dual nature makes them attractive for conservative investors, retirees, and anyone looking to balance [risk](../r/risk.md) and [security](../s/security.md) in their [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md). However, the benefits come at the cost of higher fees and some [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) constraints, factors that should be carefully considered. Always consult with a [financial advisor](../f/financial_advisor.md) to understand if GIFs align with your investment goals and [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md).

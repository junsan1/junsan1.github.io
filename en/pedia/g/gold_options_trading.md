# Gold Options Trading

[Gold options](../g/gold_option.md) trading is a financial activity that involves buying and selling [options](../o/options.md) contracts on gold. These [options](../o/options.md) give investors the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specified amount of gold at a predetermined price within a set timeframe. They are a popular [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) due to gold's status as a safe-haven [asset](../a/asset.md) and its role in hedging against [inflation](../i/inflation.md) and financial instability. This comprehensive guide delves into the intricacies of [gold options](../g/gold_option.md) trading, including the types of [gold options](../g/gold_option.md), [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), key [market](../m/market.md) players, and the benefits and risks involved.

## Types of Gold Options

There are two primary types of [gold options](../g/gold_option.md):
1. **Call [Options](../o/options.md)**: A [call option](../c/call_option.md) gives the holder the right to buy a specified amount of gold at a predetermined [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) within the option period.
2. **[Put Options](../p/put_options.md)**: A [put option](../p/put.md) gives the holder the right to sell a specified amount of gold at a predetermined [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) within the option period.

### Key Terms
- **[Strike Price](../s/strike_price.md)**: The predetermined price at which the holder can buy or sell the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).
- **[Expiration Date](../e/expiration_date.md)**: The date on which the option contract expires.
- **[Premium](../p/premium.md)**: The price paid for the [options contract](../o/options_contract.md).

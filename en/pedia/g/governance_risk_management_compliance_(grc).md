# Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance (GRC)

## Introduction
Governance, [Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md), and Compliance (GRC) is a structured approach to aligning information technology (IT) with [business](../b/business.md) objectives, while managing [risk](../r/risk.md) and meeting compliance requirements. GRC, as a discipline, aims to ensure that organizations can effectively and efficiently manage these three essential areas. It has become increasingly critical as businesses face complex regulatory environments, significant cyber threats, and heightened scrutiny of [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md).

## Governance
Governance entails the frameworks, processes, and structures employed to steer an organization's operations and achieve its objectives. 

### Aspects of Governance
1. **[Corporate Governance](../c/corporate_governance.md):** Refers to the system of rules, practices, and processes by which a company is directed and controlled. It involves balancing the interests of stakeholders such as shareholders, management, customers, suppliers, financiers, government, and the community.

2. **IT Governance:** Concerned with ensuring that IT investments support [business](../b/business.md) goals. It involves creating decision-making frameworks and policies that ensure IT is used effectively and efficiently.

### Key Components
- **Board Oversight:** The board of directors plays a crucial role in governance by setting strategic objectives, overseeing management, and ensuring accountability.
- **Policies and Procedures:** Formal policies and procedures provide a structured approach for making consistent and repeatable decisions.
- **[Performance Management](../p/performance_management.md):** This involves monitoring and evaluating the organization’s processes and outcomes to ensure alignment with strategic goals.

## Risk Management
[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md) is the process of identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks that could hinder an organization’s ability to achieve its objectives.

### Steps in Risk Management
1. **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Identification:** Determining what risks exist or may appear, which could impact the organization.
2. **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Assessment:** Evaluating the identified risks in terms of likelihood and impact.
3. **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Mitigation:** Developing strategies and implementing procedures to reduce the adverse effects of risks.
4. **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Monitoring:** Continuously observing and reviewing risks and the effectiveness of the mitigation strategies.

### Types of Risks
- **[Operational Risk](../o/operational_risk.md):** Risks arising from internal inadequacies or failures in processes, systems, or people.
- **[Financial Risk](../f/financial_risk.md):** Risks related to financial loss, including [market risk](../m/market_risk.md), [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md), and [liquidity risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md).
- **Compliance [Risk](../r/risk.md):** Risks associated with violations of laws, regulations, codes of conduct, and organizational policies.
- **Strategic [Risk](../r/risk.md):** Risks that affect an organization’s ability to achieve its strategic objectives.

## Compliance
Compliance ensures that an organization adheres to relevant laws, regulations, and organizational standards.

### Types of Compliance
1. **Regulatory Compliance:** Adherence to external laws and regulations imposed by governmental bodies and agencies.
2. **Internal Compliance:** Conformity to internal policies, guidelines, and procedures set by the organization.
3. **[Industry](../i/industry.md) Compliance:** Meeting standards and practices that are [industry](../i/industry.md)-specific and often established by professional associations.

### Important Regulatory Frameworks
- **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):** [European Union](../e/european_union_(eu).md) regulation for data protection and privacy.
- **Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX):** U.S. regulation for enhancing corporate responsibility and financial disclosures.
- **[Health Insurance](../h/health_insurance.md) Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA):** U.S. law for medical data protection and privacy.
- **[Payment](../p/payment.md) Card [Industry](../i/industry.md) [Data Security](../d/data_security_in_trading.md) Standard (PCI DSS):** [Security](../s/security.md) standard for companies that [handle](../h/handle.md) [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) information.

## Integrated GRC
Integrated GRC seeks to unify governance, [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), and compliance initiatives into a single, cohesive framework for better [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and effectiveness.

### Benefits
- **Improved Decision-Making:** Through better information flow and [visibility](../v/visibility.md).
- **Enhanced [Efficiency](../e/efficiency.md):** By reducing redundancies and streamlining processes.
- **Stronger Organizational Alignment:** Ensuring that all parts of the organization are working towards common goals.

### Technologies for Integrated GRC

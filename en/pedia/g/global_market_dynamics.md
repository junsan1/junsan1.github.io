# Global Market Dynamics

Global market dynamics refer to the patterns, activities, changes, and oscillations observed in international financial markets. These dynamics encompass a variety of factors, including [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md), political events, technological advancements, and social trends, which collectively influence market behaviors and outcomes.

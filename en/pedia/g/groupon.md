# Groupon

Groupon is a global e-[commerce](../c/commerce.md) marketplace that connects subscribers with local merchants by [offering](../o/offering.md) activities, travel, goods, and services. It was launched in November 2008, derived from the idea of a collective buying platform where customers could get significant discounts for committing to purchase offers from local businesses. Groupon's unique selling proposition revolves around [offering](../o/offering.md) substantial savings on a wide [range](../r/range.md) of products and services by leveraging the collective bargaining power of large groups of people. Here's a closer look at various aspects of Groupon to provide a comprehensive understanding.

## History and Foundation

Groupon was founded in Chicago in November 2008 by Andrew Mason, Eric Lefkofsky, and Brad Keywell. The name Groupon is a concatenation of "Group" and "Coupon," reflecting the company's [business](../b/business.md) model. Initially a part of The Point, a platform for collective action founded by Mason, Groupon's popularity rapidly outstripped its [parent company](../p/parent_company.md). The concept was straightforward: Groupon would negotiate discounted deals with local merchants. If a minimum number of people signed up for a deal, the deal would be off, and subscribers who signed up would get the [discount](../d/discount.md). If the minimum number was not met, the deal would be canceled.

## Business Model

Groupon's [business](../b/business.md) model hinges on [offering](../o/offering.md) significant discounts on popular local services and products by leveraging bulk purchasing capabilities. Unlike traditional coupon services where a [discount](../d/discount.md) applies automatically, Groupon offers daily deals that must reach a tipping point before becoming valid. Here’s a more detailed breakdown of the unique components that make up Groupon’s model:

- **Deal-of-the-Day**: The primary and most popular product offered by Groupon is the ‘Deal of the Day’, which features a heavily discounted local service or product for 24 hours.
  
- **Collective Bargaining**: Groupon negotiates [discount](../d/discount.md) deals with local businesses. These deals require a minimum number of customers to purchase before the deal is valid, leveraging collective [buying power](../b/buying_power.md).
  
- **[Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Model**: Groupon earns [revenue](../r/revenue.md) by taking a cut of each deal sold. Typically, merchants agree to provide goods or services at significantly reduced prices, anticipating increased foot traffic and future repeat [business](../b/business.md).

- **Merchant Benefits**: For merchants, Groupon offers an innovative way to attract new customers and ensure higher [visibility](../v/visibility.md). The idea is that once customers use the Groupon, they [will](../w/will.md) come back and pay full price, leading to long-term benefits for the [business](../b/business.md).

## Technology and Platform

Groupon’s operations are highly dependent on technology to manage the vast array of deals daily. Key technological components include:

- **Website and Mobile App**: Groupon’s website and mobile applications are the central platforms for all their services. Subscribers use these platforms to browse, purchase, and redeem deals.

- **Personalization**: Advanced algorithms [offer](../o/offer.md) tailored deals to users based on their location, previous purchases, and [interest](../i/interest.md) profiles.

- **Instant Coupon Delivery**: Digital [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) ensures instant coupon delivery and [redemption](../r/redemption.md), optimizing the user experience.

## Market Expansion and Global Reach

From its roots in Chicago, Groupon has expanded significantly across the globe. Key milestones in its [expansion](../e/expansion.md) include:

- **International Acquisitions**: Groupon has acquired many international clone sites such as MyCityDeal in Europe, ClanDescuento in Latin America, and SoSasta in India, augmenting its global reach.

- **New [Market](../m/market.md) Segments**: Groupon has diversified from local deals on activities and services to products (Groupon Goods), vacations (Groupon Getaways), and event tickets (GrouponLive).

## Challenges and Criticisms

Groupon's rise to prominence hasn't been without its challenges and criticisms. Some key areas of concern have been:

- **Merchant Dissatisfaction**: Some merchants have reported dissatisfaction with Groupon deals, arguing that the customers attracted were often price-sensitive and didn’t convert into repeat clientele.

- **[Financial Performance](../f/financial_performance.md)**: Groupon has faced scrutiny over its [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) and profitability. Despite high revenues, the costs associated with acquiring new deals and maintaining the platform have been substantial.

- **Consumer Issues**: Some consumers have reported issues with [redemption](../r/redemption.md) and the [value](../v/value.md) of deals, leading to fluctuating satisfaction levels.

## Leadership

Groupon has seen changes in [leadership](../l/leadership.md) reflecting its evolutionary trajectory. Prominent figures include:

- **Andrew Mason**: Co-founder and original CEO, whose [leadership](../l/leadership.md) saw the rapid rise of Groupon.

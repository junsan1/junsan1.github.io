# Gamma Adjustment

Gamma adjustment refers to the adjustments made to a trading strategy or portfolio to manage the exposure to gamma risk. In the context of options trading, gamma (Γ) represents the rate of change of an option's delta (Δ) with respect to changes in the underlying asset's price. A higher gamma indicates a larger change in delta for a given change in the underlying asset’s price. Effective gamma management is crucial for maintaining a balanced portfolio and ensuring that overall risk is controlled.

### Understanding Gamma

To fully grasp gamma adjustment, one must first understand a few key concepts related to options trading:

- **Delta (Δ)**: Delta measures the sensitivity of an option's price to changes in the price of the underlying asset. A delta of 0.5 suggests that for a $1 increase in the underlying asset's price, the option's price will increase by $0.50.
- **Gamma (Γ)**: Gamma is the rate of change of delta with respect to the underlying asset's price. It provides insight into the convexity of the option's price in relation to the price movements of the underlying asset.
- **Theta (Θ)**: Theta measures the sensitivity of the option's price to the passage of time, also known as time decay.
- **Vega (ν)**: Vega measures an option's sensitivity to volatility changes in the underlying asset.

Gamma is crucial in understanding how the delta of an option will change as the price of the underlying asset fluctuates. High gamma indicates that the delta of the option can change rapidly with small price movements in the underlying asset, leading to significant fluctuations in the option's value.

### The Importance of Gamma Adjustment

Gamma adjustment is essential for traders who employ delta-neutral strategies. A delta-neutral strategy aims to offset the directional risk of the underlying asset. However, since delta itself changes with movements in the underlying asset (as indicated by gamma), a strategy that is initially delta-neutral can quickly become delta-positive or delta-negative without gamma adjustment.

In [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), gamma adjustment involves dynamically rebalancing the portfolio to maintain the desired level of delta-neutrality. This can be done using various methods:

- **[Delta Hedging](../d/delta_hedging.md)**: This involves purchasing or selling the underlying asset to offset the delta of the option positions. As the delta of the options change (due to movements in the underlying asset’s price), the trader must continually adjust the positions in the underlying asset to maintain delta neutrality.
- **Using Options**: In addition to trading the underlying asset, traders can buy or sell additional options to adjust the gamma of their portfolio. For instance, a trader might purchase options with high gamma to offset the [gamma exposure](../g/gamma_exposure.md) from existing positions.

### Factors Influencing Gamma Adjustment

1. **Market Volatility**: The level of market volatility significantly impacts the gamma of options. Higher volatility typically increases the gamma of at-the-money options while reducing the gamma of deep in-the-money or [out-of-the-money options](../o/out-of-the-money_options.md).
2. **Option's Time to Expiration**: Gamma tends to be highest for at-the-money options as they approach expiration. As a result, [gamma exposure](../g/gamma_exposure.md) and the need for gamma adjustment can increase significantly as options near their expiration dates.
3. **Underlying Asset Price Movements**: Large price movements in the underlying asset can lead to substantial changes in the delta of options, necessitating frequent adjustments to maintain a delta-neutral position.

### Gamma Adjustment Techniques in Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) platforms and strategies often incorporate gamma adjustment techniques to manage risk and optimize performance. Some of the common techniques include:

- **[Portfolio Rebalancing](../p/portfolio_rebalancing.md) Algorithms**: These algorithms automatically adjust the positions in the portfolio to maintain the desired delta-neutral status. They continuously monitor the delta and gamma exposures and execute trades in the underlying asset or options to rebalance the portfolio as needed.
- **[Dynamic Hedging](../d/dynamic_hedging.md) Models**: [Dynamic hedging](../d/dynamic_hedging.md) models use advanced statistical and mathematical techniques to predict the future behavior of the underlying asset and adjust the portfolio accordingly. These models can incorporate factors such as [historical volatility](../h/historical_volatility.md), current market conditions, and [option Greeks](../o/option_greeks.md) to optimize gamma adjustment.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Machine learning techniques, including regression models, neural networks, and reinforcement learning, can be employed to predict changes in delta and gamma and suggest optimal adjustments to the portfolio. These algorithms can learn from historical data and adapt to changing market conditions in real-time.

# Great Recession

The Great [Recession](../r/recession.md) was a severe global economic downturn that took place during the late 2000s and early 2010s. It was the most significant downturn since the [Great Depression](../g/great_depression.md) of the 1930s. The [recession](../r/recession.md) was triggered by the collapse of the United States [housing bubble](../h/housing_bubble.md) and subsequently escalated into an international banking crisis. This topic covers the causes, events, and consequences of the Great [Recession](../r/recession.md), focusing on the United States while also considering its global impact.

## Origins and Causes

### Housing Bubble

The roots of the Great [Recession](../r/recession.md) can be traced back to the early 2000s [housing bubble](../h/housing_bubble.md) in the United States. Housing prices surged dramatically due to speculative investments, easy [credit](../c/credit.md) conditions, and lax lending standards. The Federal Reserve had lowered [interest](../i/interest.md) rates after the dot-com bubble burst in 2000 and the attacks on September 11, 2001, making borrowing cheap and encouraging investment in housing. 

### Subprime Mortgage Crisis

A significant portion of the loans made during this period were subprime mortgages, which were high-[risk](../r/risk.md) loans made to borrowers with poor [credit](../c/credit.md) histories. Financial institutions packaged these subprime mortgages into [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-backed securities (MBS) and collateralized [debt](../d/debt.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md) (CDOs), selling them to investors worldwide. As housing prices began to decline in 2006, many borrowers defaulted on their [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) payments, leading to massive losses for banks and investors exposed to these toxic assets.

### Financial Deregulation

Financial [deregulation](../d/deregulation.md) also played a role in the Great [Recession](../r/recession.md). The repeal of the [Glass-Steagall Act](../g/glass-steagall_act.md) in 1999 removed the separation between commercial and [investment banking](../i/investment_banking.md), allowing banks to engage in high-[risk](../r/risk.md) financial activities. This lack of regulation and oversight enabled financial institutions to take excessive risks, contributing to the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md).

## Key Events

### Collapse of Bear Stearns

In March 2008, [Bear Stearns](../b/bear_stearns.md), a major investment [bank](../b/bank.md) heavily exposed to subprime mortgages, faced a sudden [liquidity crisis](../l/liquidity_crisis.md). The Federal Reserve intervened to prevent its collapse by facilitating a [takeover](../t/takeover.md) by JPMorgan Chase. This event marked the beginning of the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md).

### Lehman Brothers Bankruptcy

On September 15, 2008, [Lehman Brothers](../l/lehman_brothers.md), another major investment [bank](../b/bank.md), filed for [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) after its attempts to secure a [bailout](../b/bailout.md) or find a buyer failed. The collapse of [Lehman Brothers](../l/lehman_brothers.md) sent shockwaves through the global [financial system](../f/financial_system.md), leading to a severe [credit](../c/credit.md) crunch and widespread panic in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

### Government Bailouts

In response to the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md), the U.S. government implemented several [bailout](../b/bailout.md) programs. The Troubled [Asset](../a/asset.md) Relief Program (TARP) was enacted in October 2008, authorizing the Treasury to purchase troubled assets from financial institutions to stabilize the banking system. Additionally, the Federal Reserve introduced emergency lending facilities to provide [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) to [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

### Global Impact

The [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) quickly spread beyond the United States, affecting economies worldwide. Many countries experienced severe recessions, characterized by falling GDP, rising [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md), and declining consumer spending. Governments and central banks around the world implemented stimulus measures and bailouts to mitigate the impact of the crisis.

## Consequences

### Economic Impact

The Great [Recession](../r/recession.md) led to significant economic consequences, including high [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) rates, widespread foreclosures, and a sharp decline in household [wealth](../w/wealth.md). In the United States, the [unemployment rate](../u/unemployment_rate.md) peaked at 10% in October 2009. The housing [market](../m/market.md) also suffered, with millions of homeowners losing their homes to [foreclosure](../f/foreclosure.md).

### Political and Social Impact

The Great [Recession](../r/recession.md) had far-reaching political and social implications. In the United States, the crisis fueled public anger and distrust towards financial institutions and the government. Movements such as Occupy [Wall Street](../w/wall_street.md) emerged, advocating for [economic justice](../e/economic_justice.md) and regulatory reforms. The crisis also influenced political outcomes, including the election of Barack Obama as President in 2008.

### Regulatory Reforms

In response to the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md), significant regulatory reforms were implemented to prevent a similar crisis in the future. The [Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act](../d/dodd-frank_wall_street_reform_and_consumer_protection_act.md), enacted in 2010, introduced comprehensive regulations aimed at increasing [transparency](../t/transparency.md), reducing [risk](../r/risk.md)-taking, and protecting consumers. Key provisions of Dodd-Frank included the [Volcker Rule](../v/volcker_rule.md), which restricted [proprietary trading](../p/proprietary_trading.md) by banks, and the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).

## Conclusion

The Great [Recession](../r/recession.md) was a defining event of the early 21st century, reshaping the global economic landscape and prompting significant regulatory changes. Understanding the causes, events, and consequences of the Great [Recession](../r/recession.md) is crucial for policymakers, economists, and the public to prevent future financial crises and build a more resilient economic system.

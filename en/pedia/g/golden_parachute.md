# Golden Parachute

A Golden Parachute, in the context of [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) and [finance](../f/finance.md), refers to substantial financial compensation or benefits guaranteed to a company's top executives if they are terminated or forced out following a [merger](../m/merger.md), [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md), or significant [restructuring](../r/restructuring.md). This practice serves as a form of protection for executives, especially in industries or markets where mergers and acquisitions are frequent. Let's delve into the various aspects of Golden Parachutes, their purpose, implications, criticisms, and real-world examples.

## Definition and Components

Golden Parachutes are contractual agreements included in executives' employment contracts that trigger generous severance packages if the executives are removed from their positions. These packages can include:

- **Lump-Sum Cash Payments**: Substantial cash payouts that can be several times the executive’s annual salary.
- **Stock [Options](../o/options.md) and [Equity](../e/equity.md)**: Accelerated [vesting](../v/vesting.md) of stock [options](../o/options.md) or outright grants of stock.
- **Pension and Retirement Benefits**: Enhanced or immediate [vesting](../v/vesting.md) of pension benefits and other retirement perks.
- **Bonuses**: Performance or incentive-based bonuses, regardless of actual performance.
- **Benefits Continuation**: Extended [health insurance](../h/health_insurance.md), [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md), and other [fringe benefits](../f/fringe_benefits.md) for a set period.

## Purpose and Rationale

### Attracting and Retaining Talent
Golden Parachutes are used to attract and retain top executive talent. High-level executives often face significant risks in their roles, and a Golden Parachute can serve as a form of career [insurance](../i/insurance.md). This [assurance](../a/assurance.md) can make positions more attractive to highly skilled professionals who might otherwise be wary of the instability associated with corporate mergers and acquisitions.

### Aligning Executive Incentives
These agreements can align the interests of executives with those of shareholders. By guaranteeing a [payout](../p/payout.md) upon termination due to a [takeover](../t/takeover.md), executives might be more willing to pursue or accept [lucrative](../l/lucrative.md) [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) offers that benefit shareholders, knowing their personal financial [security](../s/security.md) is protected.

### Reducing Hostile Takeovers
Golden Parachutes can act as a deterrent against hostile takeovers. Potential acquirers might be discouraged from pursuing a [takeover](../t/takeover.md) if they know it [will](../w/will.md) trigger substantial severance packages for the target company's top executives, significantly increasing the cost of the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md).

## Legal and Regulatory Landscape

In the United States, Golden Parachutes became widespread during the 1980s. The regulatory framework surrounding these agreements includes:

- **Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Code Section 280G**: This [provision](../p/provision.md) imposes tax penalties on companies that [offer](../o/offer.md) excessive Golden Parachutes, defined as payments exceeding three times the executive’s base salary. Such payments are subject to a 20% [excise tax](../e/excise_tax.md), and the company cannot deduct these payments when calculating [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md).
- **[Shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) Approval**: As a result of regulatory pressures and [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) reforms, shareholders often have a say in approving Golden Parachute agreements, especially in publicly traded companies.

## Criticisms and Controversies

### Excessive Payouts
Critics argue that Golden Parachutes can result in excessively large payouts to executives, regardless of company performance or the executive’s individual contributions. This outsized compensation can be seen as rewarding failure, especially if the executive’s performance has been subpar.

### Misalignment with Shareholder Interests
In some cases, Golden Parachutes might misalign the interests of executives and shareholders. Executives might favor decisions that maximize their personal [payout](../p/payout.md) rather than the long-term health and success of the company.

### Ethical Concerns
There are ethical concerns about the fairness and justification of Golden Parachutes. Employees at lower levels of the organization often do not receive any severance or protection in the case of mergers and acquisitions, which can create a perception of unfairness and favoritism towards top executives.

## Real-World Examples

### Yahoo!
Marissa Mayer, the former CEO of Yahoo, received a substantial Golden Parachute estimated at around $23 million when the company was sold to Verizon in 2017, despite mixed reviews of her tenure at Yahoo. This package included cash payments, stock [options](../o/options.md), and other benefits.

### Time Warner
When Time Warner merged with AT&T in 2018, several top executives received significant Golden Parachutes. Jeff Bewkes, the former CEO of Time Warner, received a package worth over $200 million, which included cash, stock [options](../o/options.md), and other long-term incentives.

### American Airlines
During American Airlines' [merger](../m/merger.md) with US Airways, CEO Tom Horton received a $20 million Golden Parachute, which was controversial given the company's financial struggles and the broader context of airline [industry](../i/industry.md) bailouts and labor disputes.

## Trends and Evolution

### Shareholder Activism
In recent years, [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) activism has led to increased scrutiny of Golden Parachutes. Institutional investors and activist shareholders are pushing for more [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and alignment of executive compensation with company performance. This activism has led to more instances where shareholders reject proposed Golden Parachute packages.

### Pay-for-Performance Alignment
To address criticisms, companies are increasingly [tying](../t/tying.md) Golden Parachutes to [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md). This means executives receive benefits only if the company meets certain financial or strategic goals, aligning the executives' interests more closely with those of shareholders.

### Regulatory Reforms
Ongoing regulatory reforms continue to shape the landscape of executive compensation. Governments and regulatory bodies are seeking to balance the need for competitive executive compensation with safeguards against excessive payouts. This includes proposals for stricter caps on severance packages and enhanced [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) requirements.

## Best Practices for Companies

### Transparent Disclosure
Companies should ensure transparent [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) of Golden Parachute arrangements in their [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) and [proxy](../p/proxy.md) statements. This includes detailed information about the conditions triggering the payouts and the rationale behind the compensation levels.

### Aligning Interests
To mitigate potential conflicts of [interest](../i/interest.md), companies can design Golden Parachute packages that align with long-term [shareholder value](../s/shareholder_value.md). This could involve linking payouts to specific performance milestones or structuring benefits to incentivize executives to act in the best interests of the company post-[merger](../m/merger.md).

### Shareholder Involvement
Involving shareholders in the decision-making process regarding Golden Parachutes can enhance [trust](../t/trust.md) and legitimacy. [Shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) votes on executive compensation packages, including Golden Parachutes, can provide a [check](../c/check.md) on excessively generous arrangements.

## Conclusion

Golden Parachutes play a significant role in the corporate landscape, [offering](../o/offering.md) a safety net for top executives facing the uncertainties of mergers and acquisitions. While they serve important purposes in attracting and retaining talent, aligning executive and [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) interests, and providing stability during corporate transitions, they are not without controversy. Balancing the benefits of these arrangements with the need for fairness, ethical considerations, and alignment with [shareholder value](../s/shareholder_value.md) remains a challenge for companies, regulators, and stakeholders alike. The ongoing dialogue and evolving practices around Golden Parachutes [will](../w/will.md) continue to shape the future of executive compensation and [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md).

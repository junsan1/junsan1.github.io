# Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT)

The Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) is a standardized test designed to evaluate the analytical, writing, quantitative, verbal, and reading skills in written English for use in admission to a graduate [business](../b/business.md) management program, such as an MBA. The GMAT is developed and administered by the Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC).

GMAT scores are used by graduate [business](../b/business.md) schools to make admission decisions. The test has four sections:

1. **Analytical Writing Assessment (AWA)**
2. **Integrated Reasoning (IR)**
3. **Quantitative Section**
4. **Verbal Section**

## Analytical Writing Assessment (AWA)

The AWA measures the test taker’s ability to think critically and communicate their ideas. Test takers are required to write an essay that critiques an argument. The essay is assessed by both a human grader and a computer grading system, and the scores are averaged to derive the final score. The essay is scored on a scale of 0 to 6.

## Integrated Reasoning (IR)

The Integrated Reasoning section measures the ability to evaluate information presented in [multiple](../m/multiple.md) formats from [multiple](../m/multiple.md) sources. It requires skills in interpreting and synthesizing data. The section has four types of questions:

1. Multi-Source Reasoning
2. Table Analysis
3. Graphics Interpretation
4. Two-Part Analysis

The IR section has 12 questions, and test takers have 30 minutes to complete this section. Scores [range](../r/range.md) from 1 to 8.

## Quantitative Section

The Quantitative Section assesses mathematical skills and understanding of elementary concepts, as well as the ability to reason quantitatively, solve quantitative problems, and interpret graphical data. This section includes two types of questions:

1. Problem-Solving
2. Data Sufficiency

Test takers are given 62 minutes to complete 31 [multiple](../m/multiple.md)-choice questions. The quantitative section scores [range](../r/range.md) from 0 to 60.

## Verbal Section

The Verbal Section measures the ability to read and understand written material, evaluate arguments, and correct written material to conform to standard written English. There are three types of questions:

1. Reading Comprehension
2. Critical Reasoning
3. Sentence [Correction](../c/correction.md)

Test takers have 65 minutes to answer 36 [multiple](../m/multiple.md)-choice questions, and scores [range](../r/range.md) from 0 to 60.

## Scoring and Validity

GMAT scores [range](../r/range.md) from 200 to 800 and are valid for five years. The total score is derived from the Quantitative and Verbal sections. The Analytical Writing Assessment and the Integrated Reasoning sections are scored separately.

## Adaptive Testing Format

The GMAT uses a computer-adaptive format in the Quantitative and Verbal sections. The difficulty of the test tailors itself to the test taker’s abilities. At the start of each section, the computer presents questions of moderate difficulty. As the test taker answers each question, the computer scores that question and uses that information to determine the subsequent question's difficulty.

## Test Preparation

Preparing for the GMAT typically involves studying the content areas tested, familiarizing oneself with the question types, and practicing with sample questions and tests. Many test takers enroll in preparation courses or use study guides and online resources to help them prepare. Resources for preparation can be found directly on the GMAC website: [official GMAC website for GMAT preparation](https://www.mba.com/exams/gmat).

## Registration and Test Centers

The GMAT is available at numerous test centers worldwide, and test takers need to register in advance. Registration can be done online at [GMAT's official registration page](https://www.mba.com/exams/gmat).

## Test Day Experience

On the test day, test takers should arrive early at the test center with valid identification and other necessary documents. The test administration includes [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [security](../s/security.md) checks, and there are strict rules about what can be brought into the test center. The test is administered via computer, and breaks are given between sections.

## Conclusion

The GMAT is a crucial component of the application process for many graduate [business](../b/business.md) programs. A high GMAT score can significantly enhance a candidate’s application profile. Proper preparation is essential to perform well on the exam, and numerous resources are available to assist test takers in achieving their best possible scores.

# Great Depression

The Great [Depression](../d/depression.md) was a severe worldwide economic [depression](../d/depression.md) that took place mostly during the 1930s, beginning in the United States. The timing of the Great [Depression](../d/depression.md) varied across nations; in most countries, it started in 1929 and continued for approximately a decade. It was the longest, deepest, and most widespread [depression](../d/depression.md) of the 20th century. The Great [Depression](../d/depression.md) is commonly used as a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for how far the global [economy](../e/economy.md) can decline.

## Causes of the Great Depression

### Stock Market Crash of 1929

The [Wall Street](../w/wall_street.md) Crash of 1929, also known as the Great Crash, saw a sudden and devastating collapse in stock prices. This catastrophic event occurred in late October 1929 and is often cited as one of the major causes of the Great [Depression](../d/depression.md). The [stock market crash](../s/stock_market_crash.md) had numerous [underlying](../u/underlying.md) factors:

- **Speculative Bubble:** Throughout the 1920s, economic boom led to aggressive investment strategies. Many [stocks](../s/stock.md) were [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md) due to rampant [speculation](../s/speculation.md).
- **[Buying on Margin](../b/buying_on_margin.md):** Investors borrowed vast amounts of [money](../m/money.md) to buy [stocks](../s/stock.md), expecting that stock prices would keep increasing.
- **[Bank](../b/bank.md) Failures:** As stock prices fell, investors could no longer cover their [margin](../m/margin.md) calls, leading to massive [bank](../b/bank.md) failures.

### Bank Failures and the Bankruptcy Crisis

[Bank](../b/bank.md) failures became a frequent phenomenon during the Great [Depression](../d/depression.md). Some reasons included:

- **[Withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) of Deposits:** Panicked account holders withdrew funds en masse, causing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) crises.
- **[Bank](../b/bank.md) Runs:** Visual phenomena of people lining up to withdraw their savings created [feedback loops](../f/feedback_loops_in_trading.md), prompting more withdrawals.
- **Lack of Federal [Deposit](../d/deposit.md) [Insurance](../i/insurance.md):** The absence of a [robust](../r/robust.md) federal [insurance](../i/insurance.md) system for [bank deposits](../b/bank_deposits.md) worsened public confidence.

### Reduction in Consumer Spending

Consumer spending dramatically decreased during the Great [Depression](../d/depression.md). Key contributing factors included:

- **Loss of [Wealth](../w/wealth.md):** With the crash of the [stock market](../s/stock_market.md), individuals lost their [wealth](../w/wealth.md), leading to reduced [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md).
- **[Unemployment](../u/unemployment.md):** As industries collapsed, [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) skyrocketed, further diminishing consumer spending.
- **Psychological Impact:** The societal fear and [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) also led to frugality among those who still had [disposable income](../d/disposable_income.md).

### International Trade Declines

Global [trade](../t/trade.md) suffered significantly during the Great [Depression](../d/depression.md) due to:

- **Protectionist Policies:** Countries increased tariffs and [trade](../t/trade.md) barriers. The infamous [Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act](../s/smoot-hawley_tariff_act.md) of 1930 in the United States, for instance, exacerbated global [trade](../t/trade.md) tensions.
- **[Currency](../c/currency.md) Devaluations:** Nations devalued their currencies to make their exports cheaper and more competitive, leading to a sequence of competitive devaluations.

### Policy Mistakes by Governments

Several policy missteps exacerbated the economic downturn:

- **Contractionary [Monetary Policy](../m/monetary_policy.md):** The Federal Reserve in the United States initially raised [interest](../i/interest.md) rates to defend the [gold standard](../g/gold_standard.md), restricting the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md).
- **Fiscal Austerity:** Governments of the era cut back on spending and increased [taxes](../t/taxes.md), further reducing economic [demand](../d/demand.md).
  
## Impact of the Great Depression

### Economic Impact

The economic devastation of the Great [Depression](../d/depression.md) had several dimensions:

- **[Unemployment](../u/unemployment.md):** [Unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) rates in the United States soared to approximately 25%.
- **GDP Decline:** The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of many nations plummeted significantly.
- **[Deflation](../d/deflation.md):** Prices fell consistently, exacerbating the real [debt](../d/debt.md) burdens.
  
### Social Impact

The social fabric of society was greatly affected:

- **Widespread [Poverty](../p/poverty.md):** Many individuals and families fell into [poverty](../p/poverty.md), leading to malnutrition and homelessness.
- **Migration:** There were mass migrations in search of work, exemplified by the "Dust Bowl" migrations in the United States.
- **Increase in Crime:** Limited economic opportunities led to desperation, resulting in rising crime rates.

### Political Impact

Politics globally saw significant shifts:

- **Rise of Extremism:** Economic despair led to the rise of political extremism in many countries.
- **Social Programs:** There was a notable increase in [welfare](../w/welfare.md) and social programs, such as the [New Deal](../n/new_deal.md) in the United States.

## The Beginning of Recovery

The recovery from the Great [Depression](../d/depression.md) began to take shape with several key initiatives:

### New Deal Programs in the United States

President Franklin D. Roosevelt's [New Deal](../n/new_deal.md) aimed at recovery involved:

- **Financial Reforms:** Establishment of the FDIC (Federal [Deposit](../d/deposit.md) [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) [Corporation](../c/corporation.md)) and Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) to restore confidence in the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md).
- **Public Works Projects:** Large-scale public works, such as the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and Works Progress Administration (WPA), created jobs.
  
### Repeal of Protectionist Measures

Gradual easing of protectionist measures helped improve international [trade](../t/trade.md) dynamics.

- **Reciprocal [Trade](../t/trade.md) Agreements Act:** In 1934 United States introduced this act to lower tariffs through bilateral agreements.
  
### Monetary and Fiscal Stimulus

An expansionary monetary and [fiscal policy](../f/fiscal_policy.md) started to take root:

- **Increased Spending:** Governments began to spend more aggressively to stimulate [demand](../d/demand.md).
- **Lower [Interest](../i/interest.md) Rates:** Central banks, including the Federal Reserve, reduced [interest](../i/interest.md) rates to enhance [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).

## Long-term Consequences

The Great [Depression](../d/depression.md) had several enduring consequences on global economic practices and policies:

### Regulatory Changes

A wave of regulatory changes was enacted to prevent such a crisis from reoccurring:

- **Banking Sector:** Increased regulation and oversight of the banking [industry](../i/industry.md), including the [Glass-Steagall Act](../g/glass-steagall_act.md) separating commercial and [investment banking](../i/investment_banking.md).
- **[Stock Market](../s/stock_market.md):** Enhanced scrutiny and regulations for [stock market](../s/stock_market.md) activities.
  
### Increased Role of Government

The Great [Depression](../d/depression.md) established a precedent for active government intervention in the [economy](../e/economy.md), leading to:

- **[Keynesian Economics](../k/keynesian_economics_in_trading.md):** Widespread acceptance of the theories of [John Maynard Keynes](../j/john_maynard_keynes.md) advocating for government spending to combat economic downturns.
- **Social Safety Nets:** Establishment or [expansion](../e/expansion.md) of [social security](../s/social_security.md) systems and [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) [insurance](../i/insurance.md).
  
### Influence on Future Policy

The lessons learned from the Great [Depression](../d/depression.md) influenced future policy decisions:

- **Stimulus Measures:** The effectiveness of fiscal and monetary stimulus was recognized, influencing responses to future economic crises, such as the 2008 Global [Financial Crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md).

## Conclusion

The Great [Depression](../d/depression.md) remains a pivotal period in economic history, serving as both a lesson and a warning. It reshaped global economic policies, influenced political structures, and left an indelible mark on society. Its legacy continues to inform economic thought and policy-making to this day.

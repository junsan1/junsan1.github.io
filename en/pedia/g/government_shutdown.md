# Government Shutdown

A government shutdown occurs when non-essential discretionary federal programs close. This happens because the government can no longer legally spend [money](../m/money.md). The idea of a government shutdown has been a recurring [issue](../i/issue.md) in many countries, notably in the United States. This prevents the government from acting on budgetary and financial [obligations](../o/obligation.md) due to a [lapse](../l/lapse.md) in funding for government operations. This topic is complex, encompassing economic, political, and social dimensions.

## What Triggers a Government Shutdown?

A government shutdown generally happens when lawmakers cannot agree on a [budget](../b/budget.md) for the upcoming fiscal year. In the United States, by the end of the fiscal year on September 30, Congress must pass appropriation bills to [fund](../f/fund.md) government agencies and operations. If there is a deadlock, continuing resolutions or stop-gap funding measures are often used to buy time. When these measures aren't passed, it leads to a shutdown.

### Legislative Gridlock

Often, the [principal](../p/principal.md) cause of a shutdown is legislative gridlock. This occurs because of political party divisions, disagreements over budgetary allocations, policy riders, or other legislative impasses. In a divided government, these disagreements become even more pronounced.

### Funding Gaps

Funding [gaps](../g/gap.md) occur when Congress fails to pass [budget](../b/budget.md) legislation for the entire government or certain government agencies. This ceasing of [fund flow](../f/fund_flow.md) results in a shutdown.

### Failed Appropriations

The U.S. operates on an appropriations system where specific funding must be approved for various governmental departments and agencies. These appropriations can [fail](../f/fail.md) for several reasons, including policy disagreements, political strategy, or unforeseen [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md).

## Impact of a Government Shutdown

The impacts are multi-faceted and can affect a wide array of areas, from economic stability to public services and worker morale. 

### Economic Impacts

Economically, a shutdown disrupts the normal flow of governmental expenditures which can lead to a domino effect on the [economy](../e/economy.md). Businesses that rely on government contracts may face turmoil. Economic projections can also take a hit due to the [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) surrounding a shutdown.

### Public Services

Public services such as national parks, museums, and passport offices close or slow down. Essential services such as law enforcement and emergency medical care continue, but there can be delays and inefficiencies.

### Federal Employees

During a government shutdown, non-essential federal employees are furloughed, and essential employees work without pay. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) offers [guidance](../g/guidance.md) to affected workers during these times.

### Social Programs

Social programs may also face disruptions. This includes delays in the issuance of [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) checks, Medicare, [Medicaid](../m/medicaid.md) services, and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits.

## Historical Perspective

The U.S. has experienced several government shutdowns over the years. Each instance had unique causes and durations, but provided insight into the mechanics and impacts of such events. Below are a few notable instances:

### 1995-1996 Shutdown

This was one of the most notable shutdowns lasting from November 14 to November 19 in 1995 and from December 16, 1995, to January 6, 1996. The standoff was primarily between then-President Bill Clinton and the Republican-led Congress over Medicare premiums and [budget](../b/budget.md) balancing.

### 2013 Shutdown

The government shutdown in 2013 lasted 16 days and was primarily over the [Affordable Care Act](../a/affordable_care_act.md), also known as Obamacare. This shutdown saw nearly 800,000 employees furloughed and somewhere in the region of $24 billion shaved off the U.S. GDP according to Standard & Poor's estimates.

### 2018-2019 Shutdown

This was the longest shutdown in U.S. history, lasting 35 days. It revolved around the issues of immigration and border [security](../s/security.md), specifically funding for the border wall proposed by then-President Donald Trump.

## The Mechanics of a Shutdown

### Initiation

- **Congressional Impasse**: The initial phase starts with a [budget](../b/budget.md) impasse in Congress.
- **Pending Deadline**: The approach of the [fiscal year-end](../f/fiscal_year-end.md) or the expiration of a stop-gap funding measure brings urgency.
- **No Resolution**: If no resolution is found, a shutdown is triggered at midnight on the designated date.

### Implementation

- **Agency [Guidance](../g/guidance.md)**: The OMB and OPM [issue](../i/issue.md) [guidance](../g/guidance.md) for shutdown procedures.
- **Employee Notices**: Federal employees receive furlough notices.
- **Operational Continuity**: Essential services continue, while non-essential operations are halted.

### Conclusion

- **[Budget](../b/budget.md) Agreement**: A [budget](../b/budget.md) agreement or continuing resolution is passed.
- **Resumption**: Operations and funding are restored.
- **Back Pay**: Furloughed employees often receive back pay, while those working unpaid during the shutdown also are compensated.

## Mitigating a Shutdown

Efforts to avoid shutdowns have been widely discussed, including the adoption of automated continuing resolutions, comprehensive bipartisan [budget](../b/budget.md) agreements, and enhancing inter-party negotiations. 

### Automated Continuing Resolutions

Some lawmakers propose automated mechanisms to keep the government funded if [budget](../b/budget.md) agreements are not reached. This could help in avoiding the disruptions that result from shutdowns.

### Bipartisan Budget Agreements

Seeking longer-term and bipartisan [budget](../b/budget.md) agreements can also mitigate the [risk](../r/risk.md) of a government shutdown.

### Improved Negotiations

Enhanced [negotiation](../n/negotiation.md) tactics and [arbitration](../a/arbitration.md) could prevent the escalation to a government shutdown. 

## Conclusion

A government shutdown disrupts many facets of government operations and incurs economic costs. Understanding the mechanics, impacts, and historical context of government shutdowns can provide valuable insights for preventing such occurrences in the future. Given the economic, social, and political repercussions, it is imperative for lawmakers to strive for timely budgetary agreements to maintain governmental continuity.

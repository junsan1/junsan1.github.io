# Guideline Premium and Corridor Test (GPT)

The Guideline [Premium](../p/premium.md) and Corridor Test (GPT) is a regulatory mechanism used in the United States to determine whether a [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policy qualifies as [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) under Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Code (IRC) Section 7702. This classification is crucial for ensuring that the tax advantages typically granted to [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policies, such as [tax-deferred](../t/tax_deferred.md) growth of cash [value](../v/value.md) and [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md) death benefits, remain intact.

The IRC Section 7702 provides two primary tests that a [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policy must meet to be considered as such for tax purposes: the Cash [Value](../v/value.md) Accumulation Test (CVAT) and the Guideline [Premium](../p/premium.md) and Corridor Test (GPT). While CVAT is used to ensure that the policy’s cash [value](../v/value.md) does not exceed the amount necessary to [fund](../f/fund.md) future benefits, the GPT ensures that there is a reasonable relationship between the [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) and the premiums paid.

## Purpose of the Guideline Premium and Corridor Test

The main purpose of GPT is to prevent investors from using [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policies purely as an [investment vehicle](../i/investment_vehicle.md) with the tax advantages of [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md). The test ensures that [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policies retain a genuine [insurance](../i/insurance.md) component—the [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md)—which must be in reasonable proportion to the premiums paid and the cash [value](../v/value.md) accumulated.

## Components of the Guideline Premium and Corridor Test

### 1. Guideline Premium Limitation
The Guideline [Premium](../p/premium.md) Limitation consists of two components:
- **Guideline Single [Premium](../p/premium.md) (GSP)**: This is the maximum amount of [premium](../p/premium.md) that can be paid into the policy as a single lump sum. The GSP is calculated based on actuarial assumptions, including mortality rates, [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, and policy expenses.
- **Guideline Level [Premium](../p/premium.md) (GLP)**: This is the maximum annual [premium](../p/premium.md) that can be paid into the policy over a specified period. GLP is also calculated based on actuarial assumptions similar to those used for the GSP.

The premiums paid into the policy must stay within these guideline limits to ensure compliance with GPT.

### 2. Corridor Requirement
The Corridor Requirement mandates that the [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) must exceed the policy's cash [value](../v/value.md) by a specified percentage, which is determined based on the insured's age. This is to ensure that the policy maintains a significant amount of pure [insurance](../i/insurance.md) protection, rather than merely acting as a [tax-advantaged](../t/tax-advantaged.md) investment account.

The percentages required for the corridor are as follows:

| Age of Insured | Corridor Percentage |
|:--------------:|:-------------------:|
| Up to 40       | 250%                |
| 41 - 45        | 215%                |
| 46 - 50        | 185%                |
| 51 - 55        | 150%                |
| 56 - 60        | 130%                |
| 61 - 65        | 120%                |
| 66 - 70        | 115%                |
| 71 - 75        | 105%                |
| 76 - 90        | 105%                |

For insured individuals above age 90, the corridor percentage remains 105%.

## Impact on Policy Management

### Policy Design and Pricing
[Life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) companies must carefully design and price their products to ensure compliance with GPT. This involves balancing the premiums, cash [value](../v/value.md) accumulation, and death benefits while considering the policyholder's age and other factors.

### Policyholder Considerations
Policyholders should be aware of the implications of GPT when purchasing or maintaining [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policies. Exceeding the guideline [premium](../p/premium.md) limits or failing to meet the corridor requirements can result in the policy losing its favorable tax treatment, potentially leading to significant tax liabilities.

### Monitoring and Compliance
[Insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies and policyholders must continually monitor policy performance to ensure ongoing compliance with GPT. This may involve regular reviews of [premium](../p/premium.md) payments, cash [value](../v/value.md) accumulation, and death benefits.

## Differences Between CVAT and GPT

While both the CVAT and GPT are designed to ensure that [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policies provide genuine [insurance](../i/insurance.md) protection and not merely serve as investment vehicles, they differ in their approach:

- **CVAT**: Focuses on ensuring that the cash [value](../v/value.md) of the policy does not exceed the amount necessary to [fund](../f/fund.md) future benefits, without imposing specific limits on [premium](../p/premium.md) payments.
- **GPT**: Imposes specific limits on [premium](../p/premium.md) payments (GSP and GLP) and requires a minimum corridor between the cash [value](../v/value.md) and [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md).

The choice between CVAT and GPT depends on various factors, including the policy design, the insurer's actuarial assumptions, and the policyholder's preferences.

## Conclusion

The Guideline [Premium](../p/premium.md) and Corridor Test is a critical component of [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) regulation under IRC Section 7702. By imposing limits on [premium](../p/premium.md) payments and ensuring a minimum relationship between cash [value](../v/value.md) and [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md), GPT upholds the integrity of [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policies as genuine [insurance](../i/insurance.md) instruments rather than mere [tax-advantaged](../t/tax-advantaged.md) investment accounts. Understanding GPT is essential for [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies in product design and policyholders in managing their [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) investments to ensure compliance and maintain tax benefits.

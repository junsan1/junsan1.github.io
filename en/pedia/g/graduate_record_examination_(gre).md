# Graduate Record Examination (GRE)

The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is a standardized test that is an admissions requirement for many graduate schools in the United States, Canada, and other countries. Administered by the Educational Testing Service (ETS), the GRE aims to measure verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning, analytical writing, and critical thinking skills - skills that have been developed over a long period and are not related to any specific field of study.

## History and Evolution

The GRE was introduced in 1936 by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. In 1949, the Educational Testing Service (ETS) was established, and the administration of the GRE was taken over by this new organization. Since its inception, the test has undergone various changes to improve its format, scoring, and fairness. These updates include computerization, changes in question types, and the introduction of adaptive testing.

## Test Structure and Sections

The GRE consists of three main sections: Verbal Reasoning, Quantitative Reasoning, and Analytical Writing.

### Verbal Reasoning

Verbal Reasoning assesses a test taker's ability to comprehend and analyze written material, evaluate arguments, and understand the meanings of words, sentences, and entire texts. This section includes questions on:

- Reading Comprehension: Questions that require the test taker to read and understand passages.
- Text Completion: Questions that involve filling in the blanks within a passage to create a coherent and meaningful whole.
- Sentence Equivalence: Questions that require the test taker to choose two words that best complete a sentence to obtain similar meanings.

### Quantitative Reasoning

This section measures the test taker's ability to understand, interpret, and analyze quantitative information. It includes:

- Arithmetic
- Algebra
- Geometry
- Data Analysis

The Quantitative Reasoning section features various question types, including multiple-choice (both single answer and multiple answers), numeric entry, and quantitative comparison.

### Analytical Writing

The Analytical Writing section tests the ability to articulate complex ideas clearly and effectively. It consists of two tasks:

- Issue Task: The test taker has 30 minutes to write an essay on a given topic.
- Argument Task: The test taker has 30 minutes to critique an argument presented in a brief passage.

## Scoring System

The GRE is scored on a scale for each section:

- Verbal Reasoning: 130 to 170 in 1-point increments
- Quantitative Reasoning: 130 to 170 in 1-point increments
- Analytical Writing: 0 to 6 in half-point increments

Scores are valid for five years, and test takers can choose to send only their best scores to designated institutions.

## Registration and Test Fees

The GRE can be taken at test centers worldwide or remotely through a new GRE General Test at-home option. The cost for the test varies by country, with the standard fee in the United States being $205. Additional fees may be applied for services such as changing the test center or rescheduling the test.

## Preparation and Resources

Preparation for the GRE generally involves understanding the test format, practicing with sample questions, and taking practice tests to build familiarity and confidence. Numerous resources are available, including:

- Official guides and practice tests from ETS
- GRE preparation courses offered by various organizations such as Kaplan [Kaplan Test Prep](https://www.kaptest.com/gre)
- Online resources and forums such as Magoosh [Magoosh GRE](https://magoosh.com/gre/)

## GRE Subject Tests

In addition to the GRE General Test, ETS offers GRE Subject Tests in specific areas of study, including:

- Biology
- Chemistry
- Literature in English
- Mathematics
- Physics
- Psychology

These tests are intended to assess knowledge in a particular field and may be required by certain graduate programs.

## Importance and Criticisms

The GRE is an important tool for graduate programs to assess the qualifications of applicants. However, it has faced criticism for various reasons:

- Socioeconomic Bias: Critics argue that the test may favor those from higher socioeconomic backgrounds who can afford extensive test preparation.
- Predictive Validity: Some studies suggest that GRE scores may not always be the best predictor of graduate school success.
- Stress and Anxiety: The high stakes associated with the test can result in significant stress and anxiety for test takers.

## Conclusion

The GRE remains a crucial component of the application process for many graduate programs worldwide. Understanding its structure, preparing effectively, and knowing the resources available can help test takers perform to the best of their abilities and reach their academic and professional goals.

# George Soros

George Soros is a Hungarian-American [investor](../i/investor.md), [hedge fund manager](../h/hedge_fund_manager.md), and philanthropist. He is one of the world's most renowned and controversial financiers, known for his vast [wealth](../w/wealth.md), influential political activities, and substantial philanthropic endeavors. Born on August 12, 1930, in Budapest, Hungary, his journey from surviving the Holocaust during World War II to becoming one of the wealthiest individuals on the planet is a remarkable story of resilience, intellect, and influence.

## Early Life and Education

George Soros was born Gy√∂rgy Schwartz in Budapest, Hungary. His family changed their name to Soros in 1936 due to the rising anti-Semitism in Hungary. During World War II, Soros avoided capture by the Nazis by posing as the godson of a Hungarian government official, thus narrowly escaping death.

In 1947, Soros moved to England and attended the London School of [Economics](../e/economics.md) (LSE). It was there that he studied philosophy under Karl Popper, whose ideas about [open](../o/open.md) society and fallibility would profoundly influence Soros's thinking and future endeavors. Soros graduated in 1952 with a Bachelor of Science in philosophy.

## Early Career and Establishing the Quantum Fund

Europe did not present many job opportunities for young graduates at the time, so Soros wrote to a number of merchant banks, eventually securing an entry-level position at Singer & Friedlander in London. In 1956, he moved to New York City, where he worked as an [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) [trader](../t/trader.md) at F. M. Mayer, focusing on European [stocks](../s/stock.md).

In 1969, Soros founded his first [hedge fund](../h/hedge_fund.md), Double Eagle. With the success of Double Eagle, Soros used profits to start Soros [Fund](../f/fund.md) Management in 1970, his second [hedge fund](../h/hedge_fund.md). Double Eagle was then renamed the Quantum [Fund](../f/fund.md), the [fund](../f/fund.md) that would bring Soros international fame. By 1981, the Quantum [Fund](../f/fund.md) had grown to $381 million in assets.

## The "Man Who Broke the Bank of England"

George Soros earned the title "The Man Who Broke the [Bank](../b/bank.md) of England" in 1992, during the Black Wednesday UK [currency](../c/currency.md) crisis. Soros had been short-selling the British pound for months, anticipating that the UK would be forced to devalue or exit the European [Exchange Rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) Mechanism (ERM).

Soros's Quantum [Fund](../f/fund.md) amassed a short position of over $10 billion in sterling. On September 16, 1992, the British government announced it would no longer defend the pound's [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md), leading to an immediate and dramatic [devaluation](../d/devaluation.md). Soros reportedly made a [profit](../p/profit.md) of $1 billion in a single day, solidifying his status as one of the most successful investors in history.

## Investment Strategies and Philosophies

Soros is known for his investment strategies and his unique approach to [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). His theories often incorporate elements of [reflexivity](../r/reflexivity.md), a concept borrowed from his mentor Karl Popper. [Reflexivity](../r/reflexivity.md) suggests that investors' perceptions influence markets, creating [feedback loops](../f/feedback_loops_in_trading.md) that can lead to [bubbles](../b/bubble.md) and crashes.

Soros's strategies often involve making large, highly-leveraged bets on the direction of various [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). He is both a short-term and long-term [investor](../i/investor.md), known for his ability to generate substantial returns in a relatively short period.

### Reflexivity

[Reflexivity](../r/reflexivity.md), as theorized by Soros, is a two-way feedback loop between individuals' understanding and the actual state of affairs. When applied to [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), [reflexivity](../r/reflexivity.md) proposes that [market](../m/market.md) participants' biases and misconceptions can create self-fulfilling prophecies, causing [asset](../a/asset.md) prices to move irrationally.

Soros has argued that markets are always biased in some direction and that these biases can lead markets to mistakenly price assets, thus creating trading opportunities. His investment success largely stems from accurately identifying and exploiting these biases.

### Global Macro Strategy

Soros's most famous [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) is the [global macro](../g/global_macro.md) strategy, which involves making large bets on macroeconomic trends across various [asset](../a/asset.md) classes like currencies, commodities, bonds, and equities. This strategy is highly opportunistic and relies on identifying significant economic imbalances that can be exploited for [profit](../p/profit.md).

For example, Soros's bets against the British pound in 1992 were based on his macroeconomic analysis. He anticipated that the UK's economic fundamentals would force a [devaluation](../d/devaluation.md) of sterling, and he capitalized on this insight through significant short positions.

## Philanthropy and Political Activities

Beyond his financial success, Soros is equally known for his extensive philanthropic work and political activism. Through his [Open](../o/open.md) Society Foundations (OSF), Soros has donated billions to promote democracy, human rights, and [social justice](../s/social_justice.md).

### Open Society Foundations

Founded in 1984, the [Open](../o/open.md) Society Foundations is a network of foundations, partners, and projects active in over 120 countries. The OSF seeks to build vibrant and tolerant democracies whose governments are accountable to their citizens. Its areas of focus include education, public health, human rights, and economic and geopolitical governance.

As of 2021, Soros had donated over $32 billion to these causes, making OSF one of the largest private donors in the world. His philanthropic work has had a profound impact on many regions, especially in Eastern Europe, Africa, and Latin America.

### Political Involvement

Soros's political activities are as controversial as they are influential. He is a significant supporter of progressive and liberal causes in the United States and around the globe. Through his foundations and personal contributions, Soros has financed political campaigns, advocacy groups, and think tanks that align with his vision of an [open](../o/open.md) society.

In the United States, Soros has been a prominent backer of the Democratic Party, funding various candidates and organizations aimed at promoting progressive policies. His political contributions have made him a target of criticism from conservative figures and media outlets.

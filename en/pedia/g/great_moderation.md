# Great Moderation

The Great Moderation refers to a significant period of economic stability experienced in the United States and other advanced economies from the mid-1980s to the onset of the global [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) in 2007-2008. This era is characterized by reduced macroeconomic [volatility](../v/volatility.md), moderation in the growth rate of output and [inflation](../i/inflation.md), and sustained [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md). Here's an in-depth examination of its key elements:

## Origins and Definition

The term "Great Moderation" was coined by economists in the early 2000s to describe the marked decrease in the [volatility](../v/volatility.md) of [business](../b/business.md) cycles during this period. The period saw a significant decline in the [variability](../v/variability.md) of quarterly [growth rates](../g/growth_rates_in_trading.md) of GDP, [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rates, and other [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md).

## Key Factors Contributing to the Great Moderation

### 1. Improved Monetary Policy

One of the most widely accepted explanations attributes the Great Moderation to improved [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md). The Federal Reserve, led by figures such as Paul Volcker, [Alan Greenspan](../a/alan_greenspan.md), and later [Ben Bernanke](../b/ben_bernanke.md), implemented policies focusing on controlling [inflation](../i/inflation.md) and stabilizing [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md):

- **[Inflation](../i/inflation.md) Targeting:** Central banks adopted explicit or implicit [inflation](../i/inflation.md) targets, which helped anchor [inflation](../i/inflation.md) expectations and reduced [volatility](../v/volatility.md).
- **[Interest Rate](../i/interest_rate.md) Policies:** The Federal Reserve used [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) policies more effectively to smooth out economic fluctuations. 

### 2. Structural Changes in the Economy

Several structural changes in the [economy](../e/economy.md) also played a role:

- **[Globalization](../g/globalization.md):** Integration of global [trade](../t/trade.md) allowed countries to diversify their economic activities, thereby mitigating the impact of domestic economic shocks.
- **Technological Advancements:** Technological innovations and advancements in information technology improved [productivity](../p/productivity.md) and [operational efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md) across various sectors.
- **[Deregulation](../d/deregulation.md):** Financial [deregulation](../d/deregulation.md) in the 1980s and 1990s also contributed to reduced [volatility](../v/volatility.md) by enhancing [capital](../c/capital.md) flows and investment.

### 3. Good Luck Hypothesis

Some economists argue that the Great Moderation was partly a result of good fortune. During this period, there were fewer and less severe economic shocks such as oil price spikes, geopolitical crises, or rapid technological changes.

## Implications for Economic Theory and Policy

### 1. Role of Central Banks

The Great Moderation led to a reassessment of the role of central banks in stabilizing economic activity. It demonstrated the importance of sustainable monetary policies and central banks' ability to influence economic stability. 

### 2. Business Cycle Theory

The period reignited [interest](../i/interest.md) in [business cycle](../b/business_cycle.md) theories, particularly those that emphasize the role of [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) and structural changes in driving economic stability. It also questioned the effectiveness of [Keynesian economics](../k/keynesian_economics_in_trading.md) in predicting and managing economic fluctuations.

### 3. Financial Markets

Reduced [volatility](../v/volatility.md) led to a period of increased [risk](../r/risk.md)-taking in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). This era saw significant financial innovation, including the rise of complex financial instruments such as [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) and securitized assets, which would later contribute to the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md).

## Criticism and Reevaluation

### 1. Underlying Vulnerabilities

The [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) of 2007-2008 exposed the vulnerabilities that had accumulated during the Great Moderation. It revealed that the reduced [volatility](../v/volatility.md) was partly masking deep-seated financial imbalances and increased systemic risks.

### 2. Overconfidence in Policy

The prolonged period of stability led policymakers and investors to become overconfident. This resulted in lax regulatory oversight and excessive [risk](../r/risk.md)-taking, which were critical factors in the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md).

### 3. Inequality and Unemployment

Despite the overall economic stability, the benefits of the Great Moderation were not evenly distributed. [Income inequality](../i/income_inequality.md) increased, and certain sectors of the [economy](../e/economy.md), particularly [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md), faced significant challenges. High levels of [structural unemployment](../s/structural_unemployment.md) also persisted in some regions.

## Conclusion

The Great Moderation remains an important period in economic history, [offering](../o/offering.md) valuable lessons on the interplay between [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md), structural changes, and economic stability. While it brought significant benefits in terms of reduced [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and sustained growth, it also highlighted the need for vigilant regulatory oversight and the importance of addressing [underlying](../u/underlying.md) economic vulnerabilities.

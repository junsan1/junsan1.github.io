# General Obligation Bond (GO)

A General Obligation [Bond](../b/bond.md) (GO [bond](../b/bond.md)) is a common type of [municipal bond](../m/municipal_bond.md) that is secured by the issuing government's pledge to use legally available resources, including tax revenues, to repay bondholders. Unlike [revenue](../r/revenue.md) bonds, which are repaid using [revenue](../r/revenue.md) generated from a specific project or source, GO bonds are backed by the full faith and [credit](../c/credit.md) of the issuing municipality.

## Key Features

### Full Faith and Credit
GO bonds are secured by the "full faith and [credit](../c/credit.md)" of the issuing municipality. This means that the government pledges its entire resources to repay the [bond](../b/bond.md), which can include imposing new [taxes](../t/taxes.md) and reallocating budgetary priorities.

### Tax Backing
The primary source of funds for repaying GO bonds is tax [revenue](../r/revenue.md). These can be property [taxes](../t/taxes.md), sales [taxes](../t/taxes.md), or other general [fund](../f/fund.md) revenues. Because the source is typically more stable and predictable, GO bonds are considered lower [risk](../r/risk.md) compared to [revenue](../r/revenue.md) bonds.

### Voter Approval
Issuance of GO bonds usually requires voter approval through a referendum. This process involves putting the [bond](../b/bond.md) [issue](../i/issue.md) to a vote during a designated election, and a majority of voters must consent to the [bond](../b/bond.md) issuance.

### Use of Funds
GO bonds are often used to [fund](../f/fund.md) public projects such as [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) improvements, schools, and emergency services. Because these projects are generally seen as beneficial to the community as a whole, they are more likely to [gain](../g/gain.md) voter approval.

## Advantages

### Lower Risk
Because they are backed by the taxing authority and full [credit](../c/credit.md) of the [issuer](../i/issuer.md), GO bonds generally have lower [risk](../r/risk.md) of [default](../d/default.md) compared to other types of [municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md). This makes them attractive to conservative investors.

### Tax-Exemptions
[Interest](../i/interest.md) earned on GO bonds is often exempt from [federal income](../f/federal_income.md) tax and, in many cases, from state and local [taxes](../t/taxes.md) as well. This tax advantage can make GO bonds particularly attractive to investors in higher [tax brackets](../t/tax_brackets.md).

### Predictable Payments
The [revenue](../r/revenue.md) backing for GO bonds tends to be more stable and predictable, often leading to more reliable and timely [interest](../i/interest.md) and [principal](../p/principal.md) payments to bondholders.

## Disadvantages

### Political Risk
Since voter approval is required for issuance, there is a certain level of [political risk](../p/political_risk.md) involved. A proposed GO [bond](../b/bond.md) can be rejected by voters, delaying funding for necessary projects.

### Tax Burden
Repaying GO bonds may require raising [taxes](../t/taxes.md), which can be unpopular with residents. Increased [taxes](../t/taxes.md) can also potentially slow [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md), thereby reducing overall tax revenues.

### Credit Rating
The [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) of the issuing municipality can significantly impact the [interest](../i/interest.md) rates on GO bonds. A lower [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) may lead to higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, increasing the cost of borrowing for the [issuer](../i/issuer.md).

## Types of General Obligation Bonds

### Limited-Tax General Obligation Bonds
These are GO bonds that have a cap on the [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md) that can be levied to repay the [bond](../b/bond.md). This cap provides a ceiling on the amount of tax [revenue](../r/revenue.md) that can be used, which can limit the [security](../s/security.md) of the [bond](../b/bond.md).

### Unlimited-Tax General Obligation Bonds
These GO bonds have no cap on the [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md) that can be levied to repay them. They provide a higher level of [security](../s/security.md) for bondholders because the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) can raise [taxes](../t/taxes.md) as much as needed to meet its [debt](../d/debt.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md).

## Issuance Process

### Pre-Issuance
1. **Needs Assessment**: The municipality identifies the need for funding, often through a needs assessment or [feasibility study](../f/feasibility_study.md).
2. **Legislative Approval**: The proposed [bond](../b/bond.md) [issue](../i/issue.md) is reviewed and approved by the governing body (e.g., city council or board of supervisors).
3. **Voter Approval**: The [bond](../b/bond.md) proposal is placed on the ballot for voter approval during an election.

### Issuance
1. **Structuring the [Bond](../b/bond.md)**: Details such as the amount, [maturity](../m/maturity.md), coupon rates, and [repayment](../r/repayment.md) schedule are determined.
2. **[Credit Rating](../c/credit_rating.md)**: The issuing municipality seeks a [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) from one or more of the major [rating](../r/rating.md) agencies.
3. **[Bond](../b/bond.md) [Sale](../s/sale.md)**: The bonds are sold in either a competitive or negotiated [sale](../s/sale.md). In a competitive [sale](../s/sale.md), [multiple](../m/multiple.md) underwriters [bid](../b/bid.md) for the bonds, whereas in a negotiated [sale](../s/sale.md), the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) selects an [underwriter](../u/underwriter.md) ahead of time.

### Post-Issuance
1. **[Fund](../f/fund.md) Allocation**: The proceeds from the [bond](../b/bond.md) [sale](../s/sale.md) are allocated for the intended projects.
2. **[Debt Service](../d/debt_service.md)**: The municipality makes regular [interest](../i/interest.md) payments to bondholders and repays the [principal](../p/principal.md) at [maturity](../m/maturity.md).
3. **Ongoing Compliance**: The [issuer](../i/issuer.md) must comply with any covenants and regulatory requirements, including maintaining sufficient tax revenues and financial [transparency](../t/transparency.md).

## Risk Factors

### Economic Conditions
Economic downturns can affect the [revenue](../r/revenue.md)-generating capacity of the issuing municipality, making it harder to repay GO bonds.

### Legislative Changes
Changes in laws governing tax rates and spending priorities could impact the ability to repay GO bonds.

### Demographic Changes
Population shifts can alter the [tax base](../t/tax_base.md), affecting the [revenue](../r/revenue.md) available to meet [bond](../b/bond.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md).

### Natural Disasters
Unexpected events like natural disasters can strain municipal finances, diverting resources from [debt](../d/debt.md) [repayment](../r/repayment.md) to emergency spending.

## Key Players in the GO Bond Market

### Issuers
Typical issuers of GO bonds include states, cities, counties, and school districts. These entities [issue](../i/issue.md) bonds to [finance](../f/finance.md) a wide [range](../r/range.md) of public projects that benefit the community.

### Underwriters
[Investment banks](../i/investment_bank_(ib).md) such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase play significant roles as underwriters, helping municipalities structure and sell their bonds.

### Credit Rating Agencies
Agencies like Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s, and Fitch rate GO bonds based on the [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) of the [issuer](../i/issuer.md). Higher ratings generally translate into lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

## Conclusion

General Obligation Bonds are a critical tool for municipalities to [finance](../f/finance.md) public projects. Their low-[risk](../r/risk.md) profile and tax advantages make them attractive to investors, while their reliance on tax revenues and voter approval ensures accountability and public support. Understanding the intricacies of GO bonds, from issuance to [repayment](../r/repayment.md), is essential for both issuers and investors in the [municipal bond](../m/municipal_bond.md) [market](../m/market.md).

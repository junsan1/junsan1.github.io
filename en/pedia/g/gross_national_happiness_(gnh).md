# Gross National Happiness (GNH)

Gross National Happiness (GNH) is a philosophy that was pioneered by the Kingdom of Bhutan as an alternative to traditional measures of national development such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Unlike GDP, which quantifies economic activity regardless of its impact on personal well-being and environmental sustainability, GNH aims to provide a broader and more holistic view of development, encompassing not just [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) but also social, environmental, and cultural dimensions of progress.

## Origins and Philosophy

The concept of GNH was introduced in the 1970s by Bhutan's Fourth King, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, who believed that the true development of a nation lay not in the mere accumulation of material [wealth](../w/wealth.md) but in the happiness and well-being of its people. The philosophy rests on the premise that sustainable development should take a holistic approach toward notions of progress and give equal importance to non-economic aspects of well-being.

The GNH framework is based on four pillars:
1. Sustainable and equitable socio-economic development
2. Conservation of the environment
3. Preservation and promotion of culture
4. Good governance

These four pillars are further broken down into nine domains, which provide a more detailed account of the areas considered crucial for individual and collective well-being:
1. Psychological well-being
2. Health
3. Time use
4. Education
5. Cultural diversity and resilience
6. Good governance
7. Community vitality
8. Ecological diversity and resilience
9. Living standards

## Measurement and Index

To operationalize GNH, Bhutan has developed a detailed set of indicators and surveys to measure the nine domains. The GNH [Index](../i/index.md) is a composite score derived from these indicators, designed to reflect the general well-being of the population.

### Indicators

Each of the nine domains has [multiple](../m/multiple.md) indicators. For example, the domain of psychological well-being may include indicators such as life satisfaction, emotional balance, and spirituality. Health may include indicators like self-reported health status, disability, and mental health status. These indicators are collected through extensive surveys conducted periodically among the population.

### Weightage

All nine domains are considered equally important for the GNH [Index](../i/index.md), although within each domain, some indicators may carry more weight than others depending on their relative significance. This approach ensures a balanced and comprehensive assessment of well-being that goes beyond economic metrics.

### Methodology

The data collection process involves face-to-face interviews conducted by trained surveyors. The respondents are selected through random [sampling](../s/sampling.md) to ensure demographic diversity and representation. Each [indicator](../i/indicator.md) is scored, and the aggregate scores are used to compute the overall GNH [Index](../i/index.md). Those scoring below a predefined threshold are considered 'unhappy,' and policymakers focus on these areas for targeted interventions.

## Policy Implications and Global Influence

The GNH framework has significant policy implications, influencing nearly every aspect of governance in Bhutan. Policies and programs are often evaluated based on their potential impact on GNH rather than purely economic criteria. For example, environmental conservation initiatives are given high priority even if they do not directly contribute to [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md).

### Legislation and Governance

To institutionalize GNH principles, Bhutan has incorporated them into its legislative and administrative frameworks. The Constitution of Bhutan itself mandates that the state "shall promote those conditions that [will](../w/will.md) enable the pursuit of Gross National Happiness." Several government bodies, including the Gross National Happiness [Commission](../c/commission.md), are responsible for integrating GNH principles into national policies and development plans.

### Education and Culture

The focus on GNH has led to the inclusion of happiness and ethics in the school curriculum, aiming to instill values aligned with the GNH philosophy from a young age. Cultural preservation is another area heavily influenced by GNH, with numerous initiatives promoting traditional arts, crafts, and cultural practices.

### Environmental Policy

Bhutan is known for its strong environmental policies, driven by the GNH framework. The country has committed to maintaining at least 60% of its land under forest cover and has made significant strides toward becoming a carbon-[neutral](../n/neutral.md) nation. Renewable energy projects, particularly hydropower, are developed with careful consideration of their environmental impact.

### Economic Planning

Although [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) is not the primary focus of GNH, Bhutan has still achieved significant economic progress. The country's economic plans are drafted keeping in mind the need for balanced and equitable growth. Tourism, for example, is promoted under the 'High [Value](../v/value.md), Low Impact' strategy, ensuring that cultural and environmental integrity is maintained while generating [revenue](../r/revenue.md).

### Global Influence

The philosophy of GNH has attracted global attention, and several countries and organizations have shown [interest](../i/interest.md) in adopting similar measures. The United Nations has hosted discussions on happiness and well-being as essential components of sustainable development, and Bhutan’s GNH model has been cited as an exemplary approach. The International Day of Happiness, celebrated on March 20th, was established by the UN to promote the importance of happiness and well-being as universal goals.

### Criticisms and Challenges

While GNH has been praised for its holistic approach, it has also faced several criticisms:
* **Subjectivity**: Critics argue that happiness is a subjective measure and difficult to quantify consistently.
* **Limited Applicability**: Some believe that the framework, deeply rooted in Bhutan's unique cultural and religious context, may not be easily adaptable to other countries.
* **Operational Difficulties**: Collecting accurate and comprehensive data for all nine domains is resource-intensive and challenging.
* **Economic [Trade](../t/trade.md)-offs**: Balancing GNH's broad objectives sometimes requires [trade](../t/trade.md)-offs between [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) and other areas of well-being.

## Conclusion

Gross National Happiness represents a pioneering approach to development that prioritizes holistic well-being over mere economic [gain](../g/gain.md). Rooted in Bhutan’s rich cultural and spiritual traditions, GNH offers a remarkable example of how nations can pursue a more sustainable and inclusive form of progress. Despite challenges and criticisms, the philosophy continues to inspire global discussions on the true indicators of national success, advocating for a development model that values human happiness and environmental sustainability as paramount.

# Good This Week (GTW)

## Introduction
"Good This Week" (GTW) is a type of [order](../o/order.md) used in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and is integral to the world of [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md). It is particularly relevant for traders who wish to maintain an [order](../o/order.md) for a specific instrument over a weekâ€™s trading period. Understanding the mechanics and applications of GTW orders is essential for both algorithmic and manual traders to optimize their [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) and achieve their financial goals.

## Definition of Good This Week (GTW)
A "Good This Week" [order](../o/order.md) is a time-in-force designation that tells the trading system to keep the [order](../o/order.md) [open](../o/open.md) until the end of the trading week. Unlike a "Good Till Cancelled" (GTC) [order](../o/order.md), which remains active until the [trader](../t/trader.md) cancels it manually, or a "Day" [order](../o/order.md), which expires at the end of the trading day, a GTW [order](../o/order.md) [will](../w/will.md) persist until the end of the week.

## Significance in Algorithmic Trading
[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) involves the use of algorithms to automate trading actions based on predefined criteria. The persistence of an [order](../o/order.md) can significantly influence the trading logic, and the GTW [order](../o/order.md) is particularly advantageous for algorithms designed to react to weekly [market cycles](../m/market_cycles.md).

1. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: GTW orders help in managing risks by limiting the [duration](../d/duration.md) an [order](../o/order.md) is active in the [market](../m/market.md). This can prevent the [order](../o/order.md) from being filled at undesirable prices due to [market](../m/market.md) changes over a more extended period.
2. **Strategic Planning**: Weekly strategies, often based on statistical analysis or patterns observable over [multiple](../m/multiple.md) days, benefit from GTW orders. The ability to place an [order](../o/order.md) with a week-long [duration](../d/duration.md) fits well with algorithms designed to exploit such patterns.
3. **Reduced Administrative Burden**: By using GTW orders, traders reduce the need to re-enter orders daily, allowing for more efficient use of time, which is crucial in automated trading where manual intervention is minimal.

## Mechanism and Functionality
The GTW [order](../o/order.md)'s mechanism is simple yet effective. When placing a GTW [order](../o/order.md), traders set a specific price and quantity for the [asset](../a/asset.md) they wish to buy or sell. The [broker](../b/broker.md) or [trading platform](../t/trading_platform.md) [will](../w/will.md) attempt to execute the [order](../o/order.md) throughout the week. If the [order](../o/order.md) is not filled by the week's end, it is automatically canceled.

## Application Scenarios

### 1. Weekly Rebalancing Strategies
A common application of GTW orders is in portfolio [rebalancing strategies](../r/rebalancing_strategies.md) that operate on a weekly schedule. An algorithm might use GTW orders to adjust [asset](../a/asset.md) [holdings](../h/holdings.md) at the beginning of each week, ensuring that the portfolio maintains its target [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md).

### 2. Exploiting Weekly Market Trends
Certain assets exhibit predictable behaviors or patterns within a trading week. Algorithms designed to exploit such trends can use GTW orders to enter trades early in the week and [hold](../h/hold.md) the position [open](../o/open.md) to capture anticipated price movements.

### 3. Managing Liquidity
Instruments with low [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) may require longer to fill an [order](../o/order.md) without causing significant price impact. GTW orders allow such trades to passively seek [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) throughout the week, improving the chances of [execution](../e/execution.md) at favorable prices.

## Implementation in Trading Platforms
Many trading platforms support GTW as a time-in-force option. Here are some examples:

### Interactive Brokers
[Interactive Brokers](../i/interactive_brokers.md) (https://www.interactivebrokers.com) provides support for GTW orders among its various [order types](../o/order_types_in_trading.md). Users can specify GTW as the time-in-force when placing orders, utilizing the platform's [robust](../r/robust.md) [order management](../o/order_management_in_trading.md) system to ensure compliance with the [order](../o/order.md) [duration](../d/duration.md).

### TD Ameritrade
TD [Ameritrade](../a/ameritrade.md) (https://www.tdameritrade.com) also offers GTW orders, allowing users to place orders that are effective for the entire trading week. This feature is accessible through both their web and mobile trading applications.

### Fidelity Investments
[Fidelity Investments](../f/fidelity_investments.md) (https://www.fidelity.com) supports GTW orders across [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [asset](../a/asset.md) classes, including [stocks](../s/stock.md), [options](../o/options.md), and mutual funds. Their platform provides detailed [order management](../o/order_management_in_trading.md) tools to track and modify GTW orders as needed.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages
1. **Extended [Duration](../d/duration.md)**: GTW orders allow trades to remain active for an entire week, [offering](../o/offering.md) flexibility and more significant opportunities for [execution](../e/execution.md).
2. **Reduced Manual Effort**: With the GTW [order](../o/order.md) type, traders do not need to re-enter orders daily, saving time and reducing the [risk](../r/risk.md) of manual errors.
3. **Alignment with Weekly Strategies**: These orders are ideal for strategies that rely on weekly cycles and patterns, supporting more sophisticated [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md).

### Disadvantages
1. **[Market Risk](../m/market_risk.md)**: Keeping an [order](../o/order.md) [open](../o/open.md) for an extended period exposes it to higher [risk](../r/risk.md) from unexpected [market](../m/market.md) events within the week.
2. **Need for Monitoring**: Although manual effort is reduced, traders still need to monitor GTW orders to ensure they are aligned with evolving [market](../m/market.md) conditions.
3. **Cancellation at Week's End**: If the [order](../o/order.md) is not filled by the end of the week, it is automatically canceled, which might necessitate re-evaluation and re-entry in the following week.

## Conclusion
Good This Week (GTW) orders provide a valuable tool for algorithmic traders, [offering](../o/offering.md) extended timeframes for [order](../o/order.md) [execution](../e/execution.md) and aligning well with [weekly trading strategies](../w/weekly_trading_strategies.md). By understanding the advantages and potential risks, traders can better utilize GTW orders to enhance their [trading performance](../t/trading_performance.md) and reduce administrative burdens. With support from major trading platforms, including [Interactive Brokers](../i/interactive_brokers.md), TD [Ameritrade](../a/ameritrade.md), and [Fidelity Investments](../f/fidelity_investments.md), GTW orders are accessible and practical for a [range](../r/range.md) of trading scenarios.

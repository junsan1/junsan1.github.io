# Gift Card

## Types of Gift Cards

### Closed Loop Gift Cards

Closed-loop gift cards are valid only at a specific retailer or group of retailers. These cards are most commonly issued by retail brands and can be used only in their stores or affiliated locations. An example of a closed-loop gift card is an Amazon gift card, which can be used exclusively on Amazon's website.

# Gift Card

A gift card, also known as a gift certificate, gift voucher, or gift token, is a prepaid stored-value money card that is issued by a retailer, bank, or other financial institution and can be used as an alternative to cash for purchases within a particular store or related businesses. Gift cards are an increasingly popular choice for personal and corporate gifting due to their convenience and flexibility.

## Types of Gift Cards

### Closed Loop Gift Cards

Closed-loop gift cards are valid only at a specific retailer or group of retailers. These cards are most commonly issued by retail brands and can be used only in their stores or affiliated locations. An example of a closed-loop gift card is an Amazon gift card, which can be used exclusively on Amazon's website.

### Open Loop Gift Cards

Open-loop gift cards are not restricted to a single retailer or a specific group of retailers. These cards, usually issued by banks or card networks like Visa, Mastercard, or American Express, can be used anywhere that accepts credit cards. For instance, a Visa gift card can be used at any merchant that accepts Visa.

## Key Features

### Prepaid Value

Gift cards are prepaid, meaning they have a set value loaded onto them at the time of purchase. This value can typically range from as little as $5 to $500 or more, depending on the issuing entity.

### Reloadable Options

Some gift cards are reloadable, allowing the cardholder to add more funds to the card for extended use. This feature is more common with open-loop gift cards and some closed-loop cards.

### Customization

Many retailers offer the ability to customize gift cards with personal messages, photographs, or special designs to suit various occasions like birthdays, holidays, or corporate events.

### Expiration and Fees

Gift cards may come with expiration dates and fees, although regulations in many regions have reduced or eliminated these. For instance, in the United States, the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 imposes restrictions on expiration dates and fees for gift cards.

### Digital and Physical Formats

Gift cards can be issued in both physical and digital formats. Physical gift cards are tangible and often come in the form of plastic cards, while digital gift cards, or e-gift cards, are electronic and delivered via email or text message.

## Benefits

### Versatility

Gift cards offer flexibility and versatility as recipients can choose their own gifts, ensuring they get something they actually want or need.

### Convenience

For the giver, gift cards remove the hassle of selecting a gift, making it easier to provide a meaningful present without extensive shopping.

## How They Work

### Purchasing

Gift cards can be purchased online or in stores from a variety of retailers and financial institutions. During the purchase, the buyer selects the card value and pays the corresponding amount.

### Activation

Once purchased, some gift cards may require activation. This process typically involves calling a toll-free number or visiting a website to complete the activation using information provided with the card.

### Usage

To use the gift card, the cardholder presents it at checkout, either by swiping or entering the card details for physical cards, or by using the provided code for digital cards. The total purchase amount is then deducted from the card's balance.

### Checking Balance

Cardholders can check the remaining balance on their gift cards using various methods, such as visiting the issuing retailer's website, calling customer service, or inquiring at the point of sale.

## Regulations and Consumer Protections

### United States

In the U.S., the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 provides several consumer protections for gift card users. These include prohibiting expiration dates sooner than five years from the date of issuance or the last load and restricting fees on card usage and balance.

### European Union

In the European Union, gift cards fall under the scope of the Payment Services Directive, which ensures transparency in terms and conditions, fees, and other relevant charges.

### Canada

Canadian regulations vary by province, but generally, gift cards cannot have expiration dates for most types of cards, and fees are restricted. For instance, in Ontario, gift cards must not expire, and fees can be charged only under specific conditions, such as replacement fees.

## Corporate Use

### Employee Incentives

Companies often use gift cards as a part of their employee recognition programs. Gift cards serve as a quick and effective way to reward employees for achievements, milestones, or special occasions.

### Customer Rewards

Businesses also utilize gift cards as promotional tools to encourage customer loyalty and engagement. Examples include issuing gift cards as part of a promotional campaign or as rewards for customer referrals.

### Business Gifting

For corporate gifting, gift cards are a practical option, providing recipients the flexibility to choose their own rewards. Companies often select branded cards customized with their logo for distribution during corporate events or holidays.

## Drawbacks

### Limited Acceptance

Closed-loop gift cards can only be used at specific retailers, which may limit the recipientâ€™s options.

### Loss or Theft

Gift cards can be lost or stolen, and unless specified otherwise, they may not be replaceable. Some issuers offer measures to secure the card, such as registration and the ability to report and replace lost or stolen cards.

### Inactivity Fees

Though regulated, some gift cards may still incur inactivity fees if not used within a specified period.

## Innovations and Trends

### Mobile Wallets

Gift cards are increasingly becoming integrated with mobile wallets like Apple Pay, Google Wallet, and Samsung Pay, providing seamless transaction experiences and easier management.

Blockchain technology is being explored for issuing and managing gift cards, enhancing security and reducing fraud. Some companies are also exploring the use of cryptocurrencies as a form of gift card balance.

### Customization and Personalization

New trends in gift card offerings include increased customization and personalization options, allowing buyers to add unique messages, photos, or designs tailored to the recipient.

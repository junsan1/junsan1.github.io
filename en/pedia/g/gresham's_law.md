# Gresham's Law

Gresham's Law is an economic principle that states that "bad [money](../m/money.md) drives out good." This concept traces back to the 16th century and is named after Sir Thomas Gresham, an English financier who advised Queen Elizabeth I. Although Gresham himself did not formulate the law in these exact terms, his observations about [currency](../c/currency.md) debasement essentially laid the groundwork for its derivation.

## Historical Background

The origins of Gresham's Law lie in the historical practices of coinage where the [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) of coins played a key role in the [economy](../e/economy.md). During periods when coins were made of precious metals like gold and silver, the actual metal content of the coins was valuable. However, over time, governments and rulers would debase the [currency](../c/currency.md) by reducing the metal content while keeping the [face value](../f/face_value.md) constant. This resulted in two forms of [money](../m/money.md) circulating concurrently: one with high [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) (good [money](../m/money.md)) and one with lower [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) (bad [money](../m/money.md)).

### Sir Thomas Gresham

Sir Thomas Gresham (1519-1579) was a notable merchant and financier in England. He is best known for founding the Royal [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) in London. Gresham observed that when both pure and debased coins were in circulation, people tended to hoard the pure coins (good [money](../m/money.md)) and spend the debased ones (bad [money](../m/money.md)). This behavior effectively drove the good [money](../m/money.md) out of circulation, leaving only the debased [currency](../c/currency.md) in active use.

## Explanation of Gresham's Law

Gresham's Law can be explained using a simple model where two forms of [commodity](../c/commodity.md) [money](../m/money.md) are accepted in an [economy](../e/economy.md). Suppose there are pure gold coins (good [money](../m/money.md)) and debased gold coins with a lower gold content (bad [money](../m/money.md)). If both coins are accepted at the same [face value](../f/face_value.md), rational individuals [will](../w/will.md) prefer to pay with the debased coins and hoard the pure gold coins. Over time, the pure gold coins [will](../w/will.md) be removed from active circulation, replacing them with the inferior alternative.

### Key Points

1. **Intrinsic vs. [Nominal Value](../n/nominal_value.md)**: The law hinges on the difference between the intrinsic (metal) [value](../v/value.md) and the [nominal](../n/nominal.md) (face) [value](../v/value.md) of [money](../m/money.md).
2. **[Hoarding](../h/hoarding.md) Behavior**: People tend to hoard good [money](../m/money.md) and circulate bad [money](../m/money.md).
3. **[Legal Tender](../l/legal_tender.md) Laws**: The principle often relies on [legal tender](../l/legal_tender.md) laws that force acceptance of both good and bad [money](../m/money.md) at the same [value](../v/value.md).
4. **[Market](../m/market.md) Reaction**: [Market](../m/market.md) participants [will](../w/will.md) ensure that bad [money](../m/money.md) remains in circulation while good [money](../m/money.md) is stored or used in alternative markets where its [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) is recognized.

## Examples in History

### Ancient and Medieval Times

In ancient Rome, a series of debasements in the silver denarius led to the collapse of the Roman monetary system. Over time, the silver content in the coins was reduced, leading to [inflation](../i/inflation.md) and a preference for [hoarding](../h/hoarding.md) older, high-content silver coins.

During the medieval period, numerous European countries experienced similar issues. For instance, in late medieval England, successive kings debased the coinage, leading to a lack of [trust](../t/trust.md) in [currency](../c/currency.md) and a preference for [hoarding](../h/hoarding.md) foreign coins or older, more reliable coins.

### Modern Examples

One of the most cited modern examples is the experience of various countries that have gone through high [inflation](../i/inflation.md) or [hyperinflation](../h/hyperinflation.md), where [fiat money](../f/fiat_money.md) rapidly loses [value](../v/value.md). For example, during the [hyperinflation](../h/hyperinflation.md) in Zimbabwe in the late 2000s, foreign currencies and hard assets became more trusted stores of [value](../v/value.md) compared to the rapidly devaluing Zimbabwean dollar.

## Implications for Modern Economy

Although Gresham's Law originally referred to [commodity](../c/commodity.md) [money](../m/money.md), its principles can still apply in modern-day fiat economies in some contexts such as:

### Currency Substitution

In countries with weak domestic currencies, people often prefer to save and conduct transactions in a more stable foreign [currency](../c/currency.md) (like the US dollar) while spending the local [currency](../c/currency.md) rapidly.

### Cryptocurrency

With the advent of [digital money](../d/digital_money.md) and cryptocurrencies, the dynamics of Gresham's Law can be observed in the preference of holding [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) or other cryptocurrencies as a [store of value](../s/store_of_value.md) while spending fiat currencies that might be subject to [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

### Central Bank Policies

Central banks must be mindful of the principles behind Gresham's Law. For instance, policies that debase [national currency](../n/national_currency.md) can lead to loss of public confidence and the [hoarding](../h/hoarding.md) of more stable or valuable alternatives.

## Criticisms and Limitations

While Gresham's Law provides valuable insights, it is not without its limitations:

1. **Simplification**: The law simplifies human behavior and monetary systems, which can be more complex in practice.
2. **Legal and Social Factors**: It relies on the assumption of [legal tender](../l/legal_tender.md) laws and equal acceptance of good and bad [money](../m/money.md).
3. **Counter Forces**: In some cases, "good [money](../m/money.md)" might not be driven out if legal and economic forces prevent it, such as times of confidence in both forms of [money](../m/money.md).

## Conclusion

Gresham's Law highlights an essential aspect of economic behavior and monetary [value](../v/value.md). While originally formulated in the context of [commodity](../c/commodity.md) [money](../m/money.md), its core principles remain relevant in the analysis of modern monetary systems. Understanding this law can provide important insights into [currency](../c/currency.md) management and the behavior of [money](../m/money.md) in different economic contexts.

# Good Faith Estimate (GFE)

Good Faith Estimate (GFE) is a document provided by a [lender](../l/lender.md) that includes an estimate of the costs that [will](../w/will.md) likely be required for a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [loan](../l/loan.md). This vital document is designed to help borrowers understand the expenses involved in taking out a [loan](../l/loan.md), so they can make better-informed decisions. The GFE helps to promote [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and is a key component of [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) lending and [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) transactions in the United States.

## Background and History

Historically, good faith estimates have been a component of the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) process in the United States since the enactment of the [Real Estate](../r/real_estate.md) Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) of 1974. This act was put into place to help borrowers understand the full costs of borrowing and to prevent abusive practices by lenders.

RESPA required lenders to provide a GFE within three [business](../b/business.md) days of receiving a [loan](../l/loan.md) application. The document had to include estimates of all the settlement charges to which the borrower would be subjected at closing, including costs like [loan](../l/loan.md) [origination](../o/origination.md) fees, [title insurance](../t/title_insurance.md), and [appraisal](../a/appraisal.md) fees.

## Purpose and Importance

A GFE serves several critical purposes:

- **[Transparency](../t/transparency.md):** It ensures that borrowers have a clear understanding of the costs associated with their [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [loan](../l/loan.md).
- **Comparison Shopping:** Borrowers can use the GFE to compare different [loan](../l/loan.md) offers and choose the one that best fits their financial situation.
- **[Budget](../b/budget.md) Planning:** Helps borrowers plan their [budget](../b/budget.md) effectively by providing an idea of upfront costs and ongoing expenses tied to the [loan](../l/loan.md).
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Lenders are required to provide a GFE to comply with federal regulations, helping to ensure fair lending practices.

## Components of a Good Faith Estimate

When borrowers receive a GFE, it usually contains several key pieces of information:

### Loan Terms

This section outlines the basic terms of the [loan](../l/loan.md), including:

- **[Loan](../l/loan.md) Amount:** The total amount being borrowed.
- **[Interest Rate](../i/interest_rate.md):** The [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) that [will](../w/will.md) apply to the [loan](../l/loan.md).
- **[Loan](../l/loan.md) Term:** The length of time over which the borrower [will](../w/will.md) repay the [loan](../l/loan.md), generally expressed in years (e.g., 30 years, 15 years).

### Settlement Charges

Settlement charges, also known as closing costs, are itemized in the GFE. These can include:

- **[Origination](../o/origination.md) Charges:** Fees charged by the [lender](../l/lender.md) for processing the [loan](../l/loan.md).
- **Title Services and [Lender](../l/lender.md)’s [Title Insurance](../t/title_insurance.md):** Costs associated with verifying the property’s title and insuring it against claims.
- **Government Recording Charges:** Fees for recording the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) with the appropriate government entity.
- **Transfer [Taxes](../t/taxes.md):** [Taxes](../t/taxes.md) that might be levied on the transfer of property.
- **Initial [Deposit](../d/deposit.md) for [Escrow](../e/escrow.md):** Funds held [in escrow](../i/in_escrow.md) to cover property [taxes](../t/taxes.md) and [insurance](../i/insurance.md).
- **Daily [Interest](../i/interest.md) Charges:** [Interest](../i/interest.md) accrued between the closing date and the [first mortgage](../f/first_mortgage.md) [payment](../p/payment.md).
- **Homeowner’s [Insurance](../i/insurance.md):** [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) costs that protect against losses due to damage to the property.

### Monthly Payment Estimates

Detailed estimates of the monthly [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [payment](../p/payment.md) are included to provide borrowers with insight into their ongoing financial [obligations](../o/obligation.md). This usually includes:

- **[Principal](../p/principal.md) and [Interest](../i/interest.md):** The monthly portion of the total [loan](../l/loan.md) [repayment](../r/repayment.md).
- **[Mortgage Insurance](../m/mortgage_insurance.md):** If applicable, includes private [mortgage insurance](../m/mortgage_insurance.md) (PMI) costs.
- **Property [Taxes](../t/taxes.md):** Estimations of annual property [taxes](../t/taxes.md) divided into monthly [payment](../p/payment.md) amounts.
- **Homeowner’s [Insurance](../i/insurance.md):** Monthly cost approximations for homeowner's [insurance](../i/insurance.md).

### Additional Information

Other details that might be included are:

- **Rate Lock Information:** Details on whether the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) is locked or subject to change.
- **Adjustable Rate [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) (ARM) Details:** If applicable, the initial rate period, adjustment period, [index](../i/index_instrument.md), and [margin](../m/margin.md) information.
- **[Prepayment](../p/prepayment.md) Penalties:** Information on whether there are penalties for paying the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) off early.

## Changes and the Loan Estimate

Starting in 2015, the GFE was replaced by a new form called the [Loan](../l/loan.md) Estimate (LE), as part of the TILA-RESPA Integrated [Disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) (TRID) rule introduced by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). While the goal remains the same, the [Loan](../l/loan.md) Estimate aims to improve the consumer's understanding and ability to compare offers.

## How to Make the Most of a GFE

For borrowers, it’s essential to use the GFE or [Loan](../l/loan.md) Estimate effectively:

1. **Careful Review:** Thoroughly review each section of the document to understand what each charge covers and whether it’s [negotiable](../n/negotiable.md).
2. **Compare Offers:** Use the GFE to compare [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [loan](../l/loan.md) offers side-by-side, focusing on the total costs, not just the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md).
3. **Ask Questions:** Don’t hesitate to ask the [lender](../l/lender.md) or a [financial advisor](../f/financial_advisor.md) to explain unclear terms or charges.
4. **Negotiate Costs:** Some fees [listed](../l/listed.md) in the GFE can be negotiated. Borrowers should inquire about reducing or removing certain charges.
5. **[Budget](../b/budget.md) Planning:** Use the information in the GFE to plan for [loan](../l/loan.md) closing and the ongoing monthly payments.

## Lender's Role and Responsibilities

Lenders are legally obligated to provide accurate and honest GFEs/[Loan](../l/loan.md) Estimates. They must:

- **Timely [Provision](../p/provision.md):** Provide the document within three [business](../b/business.md) days of receiving a [loan](../l/loan.md) application.
- **Accuracy:** Ensure that the estimates are as accurate as possible, with tolerance levels specified for certain types of fees. Lenders may have to cover the difference if the actual costs exceed the estimates beyond these tolerances.
- **Clear Communication:** Explain the contents of the GFE or [Loan](../l/loan.md) Estimate to the borrower and answer any questions.

Failure to adhere to these requirements can result in penalties and fines for the [lender](../l/lender.md), enforced by regulatory bodies like the CFPB.

## Closing Thoughts

The Good Faith Estimate is a crucial tool in the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) lending process, ensuring that borrowers are well-informed about the costs of their loans. By promoting [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and encouraging competition among lenders, the GFE and its successor, the [Loan](../l/loan.md) Estimate, protect consumers and aid them in making sound financial decisions.

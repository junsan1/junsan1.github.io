# Guaranteed Investment (Interest) Certificate (GIC)

A Guaranteed Investment Certificate, commonly known as GIC, is a financial product offered by banks and [trust](../t/trust.md) companies that provides a guaranteed [return](../r/return.md) over a fixed period of time. GICs are considered safe investment [options](../o/options.md) because they are backed by the issuing institution, and in some cases, by government [insurance](../i/insurance.md). This detailed overview [will](../w/will.md) cover the various aspects of GICs, including their functioning, benefits, types, and the factors to consider when [investing](../i/investing.md) in them.

## What is a Guaranteed Investment Certificate?

A Guaranteed Investment Certificate is a type of investment that allows individuals to [deposit](../d/deposit.md) a lump sum of [money](../m/money.md) for a predetermined period at a fixed or [variable interest rate](../v/variable_interest_rate.md). The essential feature of a GIC is the guarantee of the [principal](../p/principal.md) amount invested, as well as the [return](../r/return.md) on that investment. Whether [interest](../i/interest.md) rates go up or down during the term, the [investor](../i/investor.md) is assured they [will](../w/will.md) receive the agreed-upon [interest](../i/interest.md).

### How GICs Work

When you invest in a GIC, you are essentially lending [money](../m/money.md) to the financial institution [offering](../o/offering.md) the product. In [return](../r/return.md), the institution agrees to pay you [interest](../i/interest.md) on your [deposit](../d/deposit.md) for the term of the GIC. At the end of the term, you receive your initial investment back along with the [interest](../i/interest.md) earned. The [interest](../i/interest.md) can be paid out periodically (e.g., monthly, quarterly, annually) or at the end of the term.

### Benefits of GICs

1. **Safety and [Security](../s/security.md)**: GICs are one of the safest investment vehicles available. The [principal](../p/principal.md) and [interest](../i/interest.md) are guaranteed by the [issuer](../i/issuer.md), often backed by government [insurance](../i/insurance.md) such as the Canada [Deposit](../d/deposit.md) [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) (CDIC) in Canada.

2. **Predictable Returns**: With a fixed-rate GIC, you know exactly how much you [will](../w/will.md) earn by the end of the term, making it easier to plan for future financial goals.

3. **Flexibility**: GICs come with various term lengths, ranging from 30 days to 10 years, allowing investors to choose a term that aligns with their financial needs.

4. **Diverse [Options](../o/options.md)**: There are several types of GICs catering to different financial situations and preferences, such as fixed-rate, variable-rate, and [market](../m/market.md)-linked GICs.

### Types of GICs

1. **Fixed-Rate GIC**: Offers a guaranteed, [fixed interest rate](../f/fixed_interest_rate.md) for the entire term. This is ideal for conservative investors looking for stability.

2. **Variable-Rate GIC**: The [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) can fluctuate during the term, usually tied to a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) such as the [prime rate](../p/prime_rate.md). These are suitable for investors willing to take on a bit more [risk](../r/risk.md) for potentially higher returns.

3. **[Market](../m/market.md)-Linked GIC**: The [return](../r/return.md) is linked to the performance of a specific [market index](../m/market_index.md) (e.g., [stock market](../s/stock_market.md)). While the [principal](../p/principal.md) remains guaranteed, the [interest](../i/interest.md) earned can vary.

4. **Cashable/Redeemable GIC**: Allows investors to withdraw their [money](../m/money.md) before the term ends, often after a minimum [holding period](../h/holding_period.md). This type offers more [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) at the [expense](../e/expense.md) of potentially lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

5. **Non-Redeemable GIC**: Requires the [investor](../i/investor.md) to lock in their [money](../m/money.md) for the full term without the option to withdraw early. These typically [offer](../o/offer.md) higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates than redeemable GICs.

### Factors to Consider When Investing in GICs

1. **[Interest](../i/interest.md) Rates**: Compare the offered rates among various financial institutions to maximize your returns. Consider both fixed and variable rate [options](../o/options.md) based on your [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md).

2. **Term Length**: Choose a term that matches your financial goals and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) needs. Longer terms usually [offer](../o/offer.md) higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates but require a longer commitment.

3. **[Inflation](../i/inflation.md)**: Consider the potential impact of [inflation](../i/inflation.md) on your returns. Even though GICs guarantee your [principal](../p/principal.md) and [interest](../i/interest.md), the [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) of the returns might be eroded by [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

4. **Institutional [Security](../s/security.md)**: Ensure the institution [offering](../o/offering.md) the GIC is reputable and covered by government [insurance](../i/insurance.md) schemes like CDIC.

5. **Early [Withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) Penalties**: Be aware of any penalties or [interest](../i/interest.md) forfeiture if you need to access your funds before the GIC matures.

### Differences between GICs and Other Investment Vehicles

1. **GICs vs. Savings Accounts**: Both are low-[risk](../r/risk.md), but GICs usually [offer](../o/offer.md) higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates because you are committing your funds for a fixed term, unlike savings accounts which [offer](../o/offer.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).

2. **GICs vs. Bonds**: Bonds can [offer](../o/offer.md) higher returns and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) but come with higher [risk](../r/risk.md) because [bond](../b/bond.md) prices can fluctuate. GICs guarantee the [principal](../p/principal.md) and [interest](../i/interest.md), making them more secure but potentially less [lucrative](../l/lucrative.md).

3. **GICs vs. Mutual Funds**: Mutual funds [offer](../o/offer.md) [diversification](../d/diversification.md) and the potential for higher returns but come with risks and management fees. GICs provide a secure, predictable [return](../r/return.md) with no management fees.

### How to Invest in GICs

1. **Research**: Compare GIC offerings from various financial institutions, looking at [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, term lengths, and any additional features or benefits.

2. **[Open](../o/open.md) an Account**: You [will](../w/will.md) need to [open](../o/open.md) an account with the institution [offering](../o/offering.md) the GIC. This can often be done online or in person.

3. **Transfer Funds**: [Deposit](../d/deposit.md) the lump sum you wish to invest. Ensure you understand the terms and conditions, including [interest](../i/interest.md) [payment](../p/payment.md) schedules and penalties for early [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md).

4. **Purchase the GIC**: Complete the necessary paperwork to purchase the GIC. Keep documentation for your records, including the GIC certificate.

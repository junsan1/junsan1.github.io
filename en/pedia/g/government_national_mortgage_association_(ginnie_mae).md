# Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae)

The Government National [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) Association, commonly known as Ginnie Mae, is a U.S. government [corporation](../c/corporation.md) within the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Established in 1968 through an amendment to the [National Housing Act](../n/national_housing_act.md), Ginnie Mae’s primary mission is to expand affordable housing opportunities by creating a [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md) for [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-backed securities (MBS). This documentation [will](../w/will.md) provide a detailed exploration of Ginnie Mae’s role, operational mechanisms, historical context, and its impact on the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [market](../m/market.md) and [economy](../e/economy.md).

## Introduction to Ginnie Mae

Ginnie Mae plays a critical role in the United States housing [finance](../f/finance.md) system. By guaranteeing the timely [payment](../p/payment.md) of [principal](../p/principal.md) and [interest](../i/interest.md) on MBS backed by federally insured or guaranteed loans, Ginnie Mae attracts global [capital](../c/capital.md) to the nation’s housing [finance](../f/finance.md) markets. This, in turn, lowers borrowing costs and ensures [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) for [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) lenders.

Unlike Fannie Mae and [Freddie Mac](../f/freddie_mac.md), Ginnie Mae does not purchase mortgages. Instead, it provides a guarantee that ensures the timely [payment](../p/payment.md) of [interest](../i/interest.md) and [principal](../p/principal.md) on MBS issued by approved private lending institutions. The [underlying](../u/underlying.md) loans must be insured by government agencies such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development (RD), and the Office of Public and Indian Housing (PIH).

## Operational Mechanism

The core function of Ginnie Mae is its MBS program, which works as follows:

1. **[Origination](../o/origination.md) of Mortgages**: Private lenders originate loans through various government-insured or government-guaranteed programs.
2. **Pooling of Mortgages**: These loans are then pooled together by approved issuers (banks, thrifts, and [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) companies).
3. **Issuance of Securities**: The pools are converted into MBS. These securities represent an ownership [interest](../i/interest.md) in a pool of mortgages.
4. **Guarantee**: Ginnie Mae provides a guarantee of timely [payment](../p/payment.md) of [principal](../p/principal.md) and [interest](../i/interest.md) to investors, reducing the [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with the MBS.
5. **[Investor](../i/investor.md) [Distribution](../d/distribution.md)**: The MBS are sold to investors in the [open market](../o/open_market.md) who [gain](../g/gain.md) the benefit of the Ginnie Mae guarantee.

### Guarantee Fees

Ginnie Mae charges a guarantee [fee](../f/fee.md) for providing its full faith and [credit](../c/credit.md) guarantee on the MBS issued. These fees are a critical source of [revenue](../r/revenue.md) for the [corporation](../c/corporation.md). Unlike other MBS, Ginnie Mae’s guarantees are backed by the U.S. government, making them virtually [risk](../r/risk.md)-free for investors.

### Mortgages Eligible for Ginnie Mae Pools

For a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) to qualify for inclusion in a Ginnie Mae MBS, it must be insured or guaranteed by one of the following agencies:

- **FHA**: Provides [mortgage insurance](../m/mortgage_insurance.md) on loans made by FHA-approved lenders.
- **VA**: Guarantees [home](../h/home.md) loans to veterans, servicemembers, and eligible surviving spouses.
- **RD**: Facilitates loans for rural housing and community facilities.
- **PIH**: Guarantees loans for public housing and Indian housing programs.

## Impact on Housing Market

Ginnie Mae’s activities significantly impact the housing [market](../m/market.md) by:

- **Enhancing [Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)**: Ginnie Mae MBS provide lenders with the [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) necessary to originate more loans, thereby increasing the [supply](../s/supply.md) of [credit](../c/credit.md) available to homebuyers.
- **Lowering Borrowing Costs**: The guarantees provided by Ginnie Mae reduce the perceived [risk](../r/risk.md) for investors, which reduces the cost of borrowing for homeowners.
- **Supporting Affordable Housing**: By facilitating access to funding for government-insured or guaranteed loans, Ginnie Mae supports affordable housing initiatives.

## Historical Context

### Formation and Early Years

Ginnie Mae was established as part of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968. Originally, the functions of Ginnie Mae were part of Fannie Mae, but the Act split Fannie Mae into two entities: the Government National [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) Association (Ginnie Mae) and a re-chartered Fannie Mae that was to operate as a [government-sponsored enterprise](../g/government-sponsored_enterprise.md) (GSE).

### Evolution and Milestones

- **1970s**: Ginnie Mae issued the [first mortgage](../f/first_mortgage.md)-backed [security](../s/security.md) (MBS), creating a template that would be followed by subsequent issuers. This innovation was crucial in standardizing MBS issuance and setting the stage for future growth.
- **1980s-1990s**: Ginnie Mae continued to expand its programs and streamline its operations. It developed new types of securities, including [Real Estate](../r/real_estate.md) [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) Investment Conduits (REMICs), to meet [investor](../i/investor.md) [demand](../d/demand.md).
- **2008 [Financial Crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md)**: During the housing [market](../m/market.md) collapse, Ginnie Mae MBS remained in high [demand](../d/demand.md) due to their explicit government guarantee. The stability provided by these securities helped maintain [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) in the housing [market](../m/market.md) during the crisis.

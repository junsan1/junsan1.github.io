# General Equilibrium Theory

General [Equilibrium](../e/equilibrium.md) Theory (GET) seeks to explain the functioning and dynamics of entire economic systems rather than individual markets. It represents the interaction of [multiple](../m/multiple.md) markets and agents simultaneously, providing a framework to analyze the allocation of scarce resources in an [economy](../e/economy.md). This comprehensive approach stands in contrast to partial [equilibrium](../e/equilibrium.md) analysis, which studies [equilibrium](../e/equilibrium.md) in individual markets.

## 1. Historical Background

The origins of General [Equilibrium](../e/equilibrium.md) Theory can be traced back to the 19th century with the contributions of Léon Walras, a French [economist](../e/economist.md). His seminal work, "Éléments d'économie politique pure," published in 1874, set the foundation for GET. Walras introduced a system of simultaneous equations to describe the multitude of markets and their interdependencies, a method that has influenced subsequent economic thought.

## 2. Core Concepts

### 2.1. Markets and Agents

General [Equilibrium](../e/equilibrium.md) Theory involves [multiple](../m/multiple.md) markets, each for a different good or service. Economic agents — households and firms — participate in these markets. Households [supply](../s/supply.md) [factors of production](../f/factors_of_production.md) (e.g., labor, [capital](../c/capital.md)) and consume goods and services, while firms produce goods and services using these factors. The interaction between [supply](../s/supply.md) and [demand](../d/demand.md) across all these markets determines the general [equilibrium](../e/equilibrium.md).

### 2.2. Prices and Allocation

Prices play a crucial role in GET by balancing [supply](../s/supply.md) and [demand](../d/demand.md) in every [market](../m/market.md). In [equilibrium](../e/equilibrium.md), the [quantity supplied](../q/quantity_supplied.md) equals the [quantity demanded](../q/quantity_demanded.md) for every good and service. This price system ensures that resources are allocated efficiently, maximizing the overall [welfare](../w/welfare.md) of the [economy](../e/economy.md).

### 2.3. Walrasian Equilibrium

A Walrasian [equilibrium](../e/equilibrium.md), named after Léon Walras, occurs when the entire [economy](../e/economy.md) settles into a state where all markets are in [equilibrium](../e/equilibrium.md) simultaneously. Mathematically, it is a set of prices and quantities such that:

- For every good, the [quantity demanded](../q/quantity_demanded.md) equals the [quantity supplied](../q/quantity_supplied.md).
- Consumers maximize their [utility](../u/utility.md) given their [budget](../b/budget.md) constraints.
- Firms maximize their profits given their production technologies and input prices.

## 3. Mathematical Formulation

To formalize General [Equilibrium](../e/equilibrium.md), economists often rely on a system of equations representing [supply](../s/supply.md) and [demand](../d/demand.md) in all markets. Consider an [economy](../e/economy.md) with \( n \) goods and \( m \) agents. Each agent \( i \) has a [utility](../u/utility.md) function \( U_i(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) \) and an initial [endowment](../e/endowment.md) of goods. The problem involves solving:

1. The [market](../m/market.md)-[clearing](../c/clearing.md) conditions for each good:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^m D_{ij}(p_1, p_2, ..., p_n) = \sum_{i=1}^m E_{ij}(p_1, p_2, ..., p_n) \]

where \( D_{ij} \) is agent \( i \)'s [demand](../d/demand.md) for good \( j \), and \( E_{ij} \) is agent \( i \)'s [endowment](../e/endowment.md) of good \( j \).

2. The [utility maximization](../u/utility_maximization.md) for each agent given their [budget](../b/budget.md) constraint:
\[ \max U_i(x_{i1}, x_{i2}, ..., x_{in}) \]
\[ \text{subject to} \sum_{j=1}^n p_j x_{ij} = I_i \]

where \( I_i \) is the [income](../i/income.md) of agent \( i \).

This results in a system of nonlinear equations in terms of prices \( p_1, p_2, ..., p_n \) that must be solved to find the [equilibrium](../e/equilibrium.md) prices and quantities.

## 4. Existence and Uniqueness

The existence of a general [equilibrium](../e/equilibrium.md) was rigorously proven in the 1950s by [Kenneth Arrow](../k/kenneth_arrow.md) and Gerard Debreu. Their proof relies on fixed-point theorems, specifically the Kakutani fixed-point theorem. According to the Arrow-Debreu Model, under certain conditions (e.g., [convexity](../c/convexity.md) of preferences and production sets, continuity, and completeness of preferences), there exists a set of prices that [will](../w/will.md) balance [supply](../s/supply.md) and [demand](../d/demand.md) across all markets.

Uniqueness, however, is not always guaranteed. [Multiple](../m/multiple.md) equilibria can exist, especially in complex economies with non-convexities or increasing returns to scale.

## 5. Welfare Theorems

GET encompasses vital insights into [economic efficiency](../e/economic_efficiency.md) and [welfare](../w/welfare.md), captured by the two fundamental [welfare](../w/welfare.md) theorems:

1. **First Fundamental Theorem of [Welfare Economics](../w/welfare_economics.md):** Any competitive [equilibrium](../e/equilibrium.md) is Pareto efficient. That means, in an [equilibrium](../e/equilibrium.md) state, it's impossible to make any individual better off without making someone else worse off.
2. **Second Fundamental Theorem of [Welfare Economics](../w/welfare_economics.md):** Any Pareto efficient allocation can be achieved by some competitive [equilibrium](../e/equilibrium.md), provided appropriate redistributions of initial endowments.

These theorems provide a normative foundation for free-[market](../m/market.md) [economics](../e/economics.md), justifying that, under ideal conditions, markets allocate resources in a way that maximizes social [welfare](../w/welfare.md).

## 6. Computational Methods

Computing general [equilibrium](../e/equilibrium.md) in real economies involves solving complex systems of equations. With advances in computational power and algorithms, methods such as:

- **Scarf's Algorithm:** It uses fixed-point iterations to converge on [equilibrium](../e/equilibrium.md) prices and allocations.
- **Applied General [Equilibrium Models](../e/equilibrium_models_in_trading.md) (AGEM):** They simulate economic processes and are extensively used in policy analysis.

## 7. Extensions and Modern Developments

Since its inception, General [Equilibrium](../e/equilibrium.md) Theory has expanded to address more realistic scenarios and complexities in economic analysis. Some key extensions include:

### 7.1. Incomplete Markets

Real-world markets often have incomplete information and contracts, which general [equilibrium models](../e/equilibrium_models_in_trading.md) account for through incomplete markets frameworks. These models reflect limitations in trading certain goods or future risks, affecting agents' decisions and [market](../m/market.md) outcomes.

### 7.2. Dynamic General Equilibrium

Static models, like the Arrow-Debreu Model, analyze [equilibrium](../e/equilibrium.md) at a single point in time. Dynamic Stochastic General [Equilibrium](../e/equilibrium.md) (DSGE) models extend this analysis across time, incorporating temporal elements such as investment, technology change, and consumption over [multiple](../m/multiple.md) periods.

### 7.3. Behavioral Aspects

Traditional GET assumes rationality and perfect information. Behavioral extensions relax these assumptions, considering factors like bounded rationality, [psychological biases](../p/psychological_biases_in_trading.md), and [asymmetric information](../a/asymmetric_information.md).

## 8. Criticisms and Limitations

Despite its analytical power, General [Equilibrium](../e/equilibrium.md) Theory faces several criticisms:

1. **Unrealistic Assumptions:** Assumptions like [perfect competition](../p/perfect_competition.md), complete markets, and [rational behavior](../r/rational_behavior.md) are often unrealistic.
2. **Complexity and Tractability:** Real-world economies are much more complex than the tractable models of GET.
3. **Distributional Concerns:** While GET ensures [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md), it doesn't address fairness or [equity](../e/equity.md) in the [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of resources and [wealth](../w/wealth.md).

Critics argue that while GET is valuable for theoretical insights, its practical relevance may be limited without considering institutional, social, and political factors.

## 9. Practical Applications

General [Equilibrium](../e/equilibrium.md) Theory has significant practical applications, particularly in policy-making and economic analysis. Some notable uses include:

### 9.1. Tax Policy Analysis

AGEMs help governments understand the impact of tax policies on economic [welfare](../w/welfare.md), [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of [income](../i/income.md), and resource allocation. For instance, simulations can show how tax reforms might incentivize labor [supply](../s/supply.md) and investment.

### 9.2. Trade Policy

Understanding the effects of tariffs, [quotas](../q/quota.md), and [trade](../t/trade.md) agreements on national [welfare](../w/welfare.md) and global [trade](../t/trade.md) patterns is another critical application. GET models can quantify gains from [trade](../t/trade.md) and the distributional effects of [trade](../t/trade.md) policies.

### 9.3. Environmental Economics

[Equilibrium models](../e/equilibrium_models_in_trading.md) assess the economic impact of environmental policies, such as carbon [taxes](../t/taxes.md) and cap-and-[trade](../t/trade.md) schemes, evaluating their [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and effectiveness in reducing pollution.

### 9.4. Financial Markets

GET provides insights into the functioning of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), [asset](../a/asset.md) pricing, and the systemic risks in interconnected economies. It forms the [basis](../b/basis.md) for more advanced models in [financial economics](../f/financial_economics.md).

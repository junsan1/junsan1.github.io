# General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)

The General Agreement on Tariffs and [Trade](../t/trade.md) (GATT) was a multilateral agreement regulating international [trade](../t/trade.md). GATT was intended to boost [economic recovery](../e/economic_recovery.md) after World War II through reconstructing and fostering international [trade](../t/trade.md). The agreement aimed to reduce tariffs, eliminate [trade](../t/trade.md) barriers, and provide a platform for the [negotiation](../n/negotiation.md) of international [trade](../t/trade.md) agreements. 

## Objectives and Principles

### Liberalization of Trade

One of the primary objectives of GATT was the liberalization of [trade](../t/trade.md) through the reduction of tariffs and other [trade](../t/trade.md) barriers. By promoting a freer flow of goods and services between nations, GATT sought to foster [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) and development around the world.

### Non-discrimination

GATT established the principle of non-discrimination among the trading nations. This principle was embodied in the Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) clause, which required that any favorable treatment of one nation's goods must be extended to all member countries. This clause was designed to ensure that [trade](../t/trade.md) barriers were not selectively applied to particular countries, promoting fairness and equality in international [trade](../t/trade.md).

### Reciprocity

The principle of reciprocity in GATT encouraged member countries to provide mutual concessions in [tariff](../t/tariff.md) reductions. This meant that [trade](../t/trade.md) negotiations were typically bilateral, and countries were expected to provide equivalent concessions to their trading partners, ensuring balanced and fair [trade](../t/trade.md) agreements.

### Transparency

GATT aimed to promote [transparency](../t/transparency.md) in international [trade](../t/trade.md) by requiring member countries to publish their [trade](../t/trade.md) regulations, tariffs, and [trade](../t/trade.md) agreements. This [transparency](../t/transparency.md) was intended to make it easier for businesses to navigate the global [market](../m/market.md) and reduce misunderstandings and disputes.

## Evolution of GATT

### Geneva Round (1947)

The GATT was first signed in 1947 by 23 countries in Geneva, Switzerland. This initial agreement was part of the larger Bretton Woods framework, which also led to the creation of the International Monetary [Fund](../f/fund.md) (IMF) and the [World Bank](../w/world_bank.md). The Geneva Round primarily focused on [tariff](../t/tariff.md) reduction and laid the groundwork for future [trade liberalization](../t/trade_liberalization.md).

### Annecy Round (1949)

The Annecy Round saw the accession of ten new countries to the agreement and further negotiations on [tariff](../t/tariff.md) reductions. This round continued the [momentum](../m/momentum.md) toward [trade liberalization](../t/trade_liberalization.md) established in the Geneva Round.

### Torquay Round (1950-1951)

The Torquay Round resulted in significant [tariff](../t/tariff.md) concessions involving over 8,700 [tariff](../t/tariff.md) cuts. This round marked a substantial step forward in reducing global [trade](../t/trade.md) barriers and facilitating [trade](../t/trade.md) flows.

### Geneva Round (1956)

The second Geneva Round was notable for its focus on addressing non-[tariff](../t/tariff.md) barriers, in addition to further [tariff](../t/tariff.md) reductions. The round's success in reducing non-[tariff](../t/tariff.md) barriers signaled a growing awareness of the need to address a broader [range](../r/range.md) of [trade](../t/trade.md) restrictions to promote global [trade](../t/trade.md).

### Dillon Round (1960-1961)

The Dillon Round was named after U.S. Undersecretary of State Douglas Dillon and saw the participation of 26 countries. It aimed to harmonize [tariff](../t/tariff.md) reductions and address specific [trade](../t/trade.md) issues among industrial countries. The round marked the beginning of more comprehensive negotiations involving [multiple](../m/multiple.md) sectors of the [economy](../e/economy.md).

### Kennedy Round (1964-1967)

The Kennedy Round was one of the most ambitious and successful rounds of GATT negotiations. It introduced the concept of "across-the-board" [tariff](../t/tariff.md) cuts, meaning that negotiations focused on a general reduction of tariffs rather than negotiating product by product. This round also aimed to address anti-[dumping](../d/dumping.md) measures and other non-[tariff](../t/tariff.md) barriers.

### Tokyo Round (1973-1979)

The Tokyo Round was notable for its efforts to create a more equitable trading system for developing countries. It addressed non-[tariff](../t/tariff.md) barriers, subsidies, countervailing duties, and established guidelines for government [procurement](../p/procurement.md). This round marked a significant broadening of the GATT agenda, focusing on several regulatory and policy issues impacting international [trade](../t/trade.md).

### Uruguay Round (1986-1994)

The Uruguay Round was a landmark in the history of GATT. It led to the creation of the World [Trade](../t/trade.md) Organization (WTO) and brought about major reforms in the global trading system. The round addressed a wide [range](../r/range.md) of issues, including the reduction of agricultural subsidies, the liberalization of [trade](../t/trade.md) in services, intellectual [property rights](../p/property_rights.md), and measures to improve dispute resolution mechanisms. The establishment of the WTO in 1995 as a successor to GATT marked the transition to a more structured and enforceable system of international [trade](../t/trade.md) regulation.

## Impact of GATT

### Economic Growth and Development

GATT played a key role in facilitating global [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) and development. By reducing [trade](../t/trade.md) barriers and promoting a more [open](../o/open.md) and transparent trading system, GATT contributed to the [expansion](../e/expansion.md) of international [trade](../t/trade.md), allowing countries to benefit from increased [market](../m/market.md) access, [economies of scale](../e/economies_of_scale.md), and the diffusion of technology and innovation.

### Trade Liberalization

GATT's successive rounds of negotiations resulted in significant reductions in tariffs and other [trade](../t/trade.md) barriers, promoting greater [trade liberalization](../t/trade_liberalization.md) across the world. This [trend](../t/trend.md) toward [trade](../t/trade.md) opening has been associated with increased global [trade](../t/trade.md) volumes, enhanced [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md), and the creation of new economic opportunities.

### Multilateral Trade System

GATT established the foundations for the modern multilateral trading system. By promoting non-discrimination, [transparency](../t/transparency.md), and reciprocity, GATT laid the groundwork for a rules-based international [trade](../t/trade.md) regime. The creation of the WTO further strengthened and institutionalized this system, providing a forum for [trade](../t/trade.md) negotiations, dispute resolution, and the enforcement of [trade](../t/trade.md) rules.

### Development of Trade Law

GATT contributed to the development of international [trade](../t/trade.md) law by establishing a body of rules and principles governing [trade](../t/trade.md) relations among countries. These rules helped to standardize [trade](../t/trade.md) practices, reduce [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md), and provide a [basis](../b/basis.md) for resolving [trade](../t/trade.md) disputes.

## Challenges and Criticisms

### Inequities for Developing Countries

While GATT made significant strides in promoting [trade liberalization](../t/trade_liberalization.md), it also faced criticism for not adequately addressing the needs and concerns of developing countries. Many developing nations argued that the GATT framework favored developed countries and did not provide sufficient support or flexibility for their economic development.

### Non-tariff Barriers

Even though GATT succeeded in reducing tariffs, non-[tariff](../t/tariff.md) barriers such as [quotas](../q/quota.md), subsidies, and discriminatory regulations remained significant obstacles to [free trade](../f/free_trade.md). Addressing these non-[tariff](../t/tariff.md) barriers required further negotiations and modifications to the GATT framework.

### Enforcement and Dispute Resolution

The enforcement mechanisms under GATT were often criticized for being weak and ineffective. The dispute resolution process lacked the binding authority and enforcement power necessary to resolve conflicts conclusively. The establishment of the WTO sought to address these shortcomings by providing a more [robust](../r/robust.md) and enforceable dispute resolution mechanism.

## Conclusion

The General Agreement on Tariffs and [Trade](../t/trade.md) (GATT) was a foundational element in the post-World War II international economic [order](../o/order.md). By promoting [trade liberalization](../t/trade_liberalization.md), non-discrimination, reciprocity, and [transparency](../t/transparency.md), GATT contributed to the growth and development of the global [economy](../e/economy.md). The transition to the WTO marked an evolution and [expansion](../e/expansion.md) of GATT's principles, creating a more structured and enforceable system for international [trade](../t/trade.md). Despite facing challenges and criticisms, GATT's legacy remains a critical part of the history of international [trade](../t/trade.md) and continues to influence contemporary [trade](../t/trade.md) policies and agreements.

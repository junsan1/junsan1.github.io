# Gas (Ethereum)

Gas is a term used in the [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) network to denote the computational effort required to execute operations, such as executing contracts, transactions, or running applications. It is an integral part of [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md)'s operation, ensuring that the network remains functional, fair, and protected from abusive practices. Gas is paid in Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md), and serves [multiple](../m/multiple.md) purposes in the ecosystem.

## What is Gas?

In very simple terms, gas measures the amount of computational work that an operation would require. Think of it as a unit indicating the amount of effort needed to execute a particular action or a set of actions on the [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md). Each [transaction](../t/transaction.md) or operation on [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) requires a certain amount of gas.

The concept of gas was introduced to decentralize the computational costs of running the [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) Virtual Machine (EVM). Rather than giving every computational operation the ability to influence the network's performance and clog it with prolonged computations, gas limits incentivize transactions that [will](../w/will.md) complete promptly and at reasonable resource usage.

## Gas Units and Gas Prices

Gas units represent the work done, while gas prices determine the amount of Ether to be paid per unit of gas. Both components play crucial roles in the [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) network [economy](../e/economy.md).

### Gas Units

Gas units quantify every operation's computational complexity within [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md). For example:

- Simple operations like sending ETH from one address to another might consume around 21,000 gas units.
- More complex operations, such as executing [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md), can consume more gas depending on the complexity and depth of the action.

### Gas Prices (Gwei)

Gas prices are presented in "Gwei," a [denomination](../d/denomination.md) of Ether. 1 Ether (ETH) is equivalent to:
- 1,000,000,000 Gwei (10^9 Gwei).

Users can set their gas prices based on how much they are willing to pay per gas unit. Higher gas prices incentivize miners to prioritize that particular [transaction](../t/transaction.md), ensuring it's executed faster. Conversely, lower gas prices might delay the [transaction](../t/transaction.md) processing or cause it to [fail](../f/fail.md) if the network is too congested.

## How Gas Works

When you send a [transaction](../t/transaction.md) or trigger [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md) on [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md), several steps occur:

1. **Define Gas Limit**: You set a "gas limit," representing the maximum amount of gas units you are willing to spend on the [transaction](../t/transaction.md). This limit ensures that excessive or unsuccessful transactions don't drain your balance.
   
2. **Set Gas Price**: You specify the gas price you're willing to pay per gas unit, typically in Gwei. The cost directly affects the [transaction](../t/transaction.md)'s priority and speed of [execution](../e/execution.md).

3. **[Transaction Execution](../t/transaction_execution.md)**: Miners, who validate and process transactions, [will](../w/will.md) favor transactions with higher gas prices. They execute the [transaction](../t/transaction.md) as long as it doesn't exceed the gas limit.

4. **Gas Consumption**: If the [transaction](../t/transaction.md) completes successfully, the total gas used is multiplied by the gas price, representing the cost paid by the user. Any unused gas is automatically refunded.

5. **Insufficient Gas**: If the supplied gas limit is insufficient, the [transaction](../t/transaction.md) fails. However, any gas consumed until that point is not refundable.

## Importance of Gas in Ethereum

Gas ensures that the [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) network remains secure and operational by:

1. **Preventing Spam and Abuse**: By associating every computational effort with a cost, gas mitigates spam attacks where users could otherwise flood the network with trivial or malicious operations.
   
2. **Resource Allocation**: Gas quantifies complexity, prioritizing more urgent or complex transactions through pricing dynamics. This allows for better management of network resources during peak times.

3. **Economic Incentives**: Miners receive gas payments based on the gas price and units consumed. This incentivizes miners to validate and process transactions, maintaining the network's health and reliability.

## Ethereum Gas Mechanics

Understanding how gas mechanics work is crucial for optimizing [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) transactions and [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md).

### Gas Limit and Gas Price

When creating a [transaction](../t/transaction.md), users determine two primary factors: gas limit and gas price.

- **Gas Limit**: The upper boundary on the total gas units that any action or [transaction](../t/transaction.md) can consume. For regular ETH transfers, a gas limit of 21,000 is usually sufficient. [Smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md) necessitate assessing their intrinsic complexity to set an appropriate limit.
- **Gas Price**: Proposed in Gwei, this is the compensation proposed for each gas unit consumed.

Miners prioritize transactions by the offered gas price, making the price a competitive element influencing [transaction](../t/transaction.md) inclusion in blocks. Higher offers generally translate to quicker inclusion due to higher incentives for miners.

### Gas Cost of Ethereum Operations

Each operation has a predetermined gas cost, which varies depending on its computational complexity. Standard operations include:

- **Addition (ADD)**: Costs a minimal amount of gas.
- **Multiplication (MUL)**: Costs slightly more than addition.
- **Storing Data (SSTORE)**: Involves higher costs due to the state changes on the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md).

### Dynamic Gas Pricing

Two mechanisms influence how gas prices fluctuate:

- **Network Congestion**: During peak periods, higher gas prices can be beneficial, as users compete for space in blocks.
- **Base [Fee](../f/fee.md) Adjustments**: EIP-1559 introduced a base [fee](../f/fee.md) that auto-adjusts based on network [demand](../d/demand.md). The inclusion of a "tip" or "priority [fee](../f/fee.md)" allows further incentivization for faster processing.

## Smart Contracts and Gas Optimization

Smart contract developers must be adept at managing gas to ensure usability and cost-[efficiency](../e/efficiency.md).

### Efficient Code Practices

Developers can build more gas-efficient contracts with:

- **Optimized Data Structures**: Choosing efficient variable types and data structures can reduce computational effort.
- **Reduced On-Chain Storage**: Since storage operations incur significant gas costs, minimizing reliance on [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) storage can [yield](../y/yield.md) cost-saving measures.
- **[Batch Processing](../b/batch_processing.md)**: Consolidating [multiple](../m/multiple.md) small computations into fewer larger ones can mitigate overhead.

### Gas Limit Strategies

Determining adequate gas limits for contract [execution](../e/execution.md) is vital:

- **Testing**: Exhaustive testing quantifies how much gas a function [will](../w/will.md) typically require.
- **Estimations**: Using tools and estimations provide a forecast for gas requirements. Underestimating leads to failed transactions, while overestimating leads to higher upfront costs and reduced financial [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md).

## Gas and Ethereum Upgrades

[Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md)'s roadmap includes updates designed to enhance [scalability](../s/scalability.md) and gas [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md). Notably, [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) 2.0 introduces two key components:

- **Proof of Stake (PoS)**: Transition from Proof of Work (PoW) to PoS aims to reduce energy consumption and optimize network performance.
- **Sharding**: Sharding splits the network into smaller parts (shards) processing transactions parallelly, thus lowering individual shard [load](../l/load.md) and reducing gas costs.

## Gas Tools and Resources

Several platforms and tools assist users and developers with managing gas:

- **ETH Gas Station**: Provides real-time metrics on gas prices and estimated [transaction](../t/transaction.md) times (https://ethgasstation.info/).
- **MyCrypto**: A versatile wallet supporting gas management features (https://www.mycrypto.com/).
- **Etherscan Gas Tracker**: Monitors and predicts gas prices, allowing users to strategize transactions (https://etherscan.io/gastracker).

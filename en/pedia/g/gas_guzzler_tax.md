# Gas Guzzler Tax

The Gas Guzzler Tax is a tax levied by the United States government on the [sale](../s/sale.md) of new vehicles that do not meet certain fuel [economy](../e/economy.md) standards. The primary objective of this tax is to encourage the production and consumption of more fuel-efficient vehicles, thus reducing overall fuel consumption and environmental impact. Established as part of the Energy Tax Act of 1978, the Gas Guzzler Tax specifically targets vehicles that [fail](../f/fail.md) to comply with the miles per gallon (mpg) thresholds set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

## Background and Purpose

The Gas Guzzler Tax was introduced in response to the oil crises of the 1970s, which exposed the vulnerabilities of the U.S. [economy](../e/economy.md) to fluctuations in oil prices and [supply](../s/supply.md) disruptions. The tax aimed to incentivize automobile manufacturers to develop more fuel-efficient vehicles and discourage consumers from purchasing fuel-inefficient cars, particularly large and luxury vehicles known for their high fuel consumption.

## Calculation and Rates

The Gas Guzzler Tax is calculated based on the fuel [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) of a vehicle, measured in miles per gallon (mpg). The EPA conducts fuel [economy](../e/economy.md) testing for new vehicle models, and the results determine whether a vehicle falls below the specified fuel [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) threshold and is subject to the tax. 

### Tax Rates

The tax rates are graduated, meaning the amount of tax increases as the fuel [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) of the vehicle decreases. For example, as of 2023, the tax rates are structured as follows:

- 22.5 mpg or more: No tax
- 21.5 to 22.4 mpg: $1,000
- 20.5 to 21.4 mpg: $1,300
- 19.5 to 20.4 mpg: $1,700
- 18.5 to 19.4 mpg: $2,100
- 17.5 to 18.4 mpg: $2,600
- 16.5 to 17.4 mpg: $3,000
- 15.5 to 16.4 mpg: $3,700
- 14.5 to 15.4 mpg: $4,500
- 13.5 to 14.4 mpg: $5,400
- 12.5 to 13.4 mpg: $6,400
- Less than 12.5 mpg: $7,700

## Application and Exemptions

The Gas Guzzler Tax applies to new passenger cars sold or leased in the United States. Certain categories of vehicles are exempt from the tax, including trucks, minivans, and sport [utility](../u/utility.md) vehicles (SUVs). The rationale behind these exemptions is that these vehicles are often used for commercial purposes or have a different set of [utility](../u/utility.md) considerations compared to typical passenger cars.

The tax is typically added to the manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) of the vehicle and is collected by the manufacturer or importer upon the vehicle's [sale](../s/sale.md). The funds raised from the Gas Guzzler Tax are directed to the [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) and contribute to the federal [budget](../b/budget.md).

## Impact on Consumer Behavior and Industry

The Gas Guzzler Tax has had a mixed impact on consumer behavior and the automotive [industry](../i/industry.md). On one hand, it has succeeded in raising awareness about the importance of fuel [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and has encouraged some consumers to opt for more fuel-efficient vehicles. On the other hand, the tax primarily affects luxury and high-performance cars, which make up a small percentage of overall vehicle sales. As a result, its impact on reducing overall fuel consumption and emissions has been somewhat limited.

### Influence on Automakers

Automakers have responded to the Gas Guzzler Tax by [investing](../i/investing.md) in fuel-saving technologies and engineering improvements. Developments such as turbocharging, hybrid powertrains, and lightweight materials have been partly driven by the need to meet fuel [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) standards and avoid the tax. Some manufacturers have also focused on producing a broader [range](../r/range.md) of models with varying levels of fuel [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) to cater to different [market](../m/market.md) segments and consumer preferences.

### Criticisms and Calls for Reform

The Gas Guzzler Tax has faced criticism for several reasons. Critics argue that it disproportionately targets a narrow segment of the automotive [market](../m/market.md) and exempts other vehicles, such as SUVs and trucks, that can be equally inefficient in terms of fuel consumption. Additionally, advancements in automotive technology and changes in consumer preferences have led some to question the relevance and effectiveness of the tax in its current form.

There have been calls for reforming the Gas Guzzler Tax to make it more comprehensive and reflective of modern vehicle usage patterns. Some proposals suggest extending the tax to include a wider [range](../r/range.md) of vehicles, increasing the tax rates, or implementing a more dynamic system that adjusts to changing fuel [economy](../e/economy.md) standards and [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

## Conclusion

The Gas Guzzler Tax remains a tool in the United States' efforts to promote fuel [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and reduce environmental impact. While it has achieved some success in encouraging the development and adoption of more fuel-efficient vehicles, its overall effectiveness is limited by its narrow [scope](../s/scope.md) and focus. Ongoing discussions about reforms and updates to the tax indicate that there is potential for it to evolve and better align with contemporary automotive and environmental goals.

# General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a comprehensive data protection law enacted by the [European Union](../e/european_union_(eu).md) (EU) that governs how organizations [handle](../h/handle.md) personal data. It was enforced on May 25, 2018, replacing the 1995 Data Protection Directive. GDPR aims to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe, providing individuals with greater control over their personal data while imposing strict rules on those who host and process this data. This regulation has significant implications for any [business](../b/business.md) or organization that processes data of EU citizens, regardless of where the [business](../b/business.md) is located.

## Core Principles of GDPR

GDPR is built on several core principles that organizations must adhere to when processing personal data:

### Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency
Organizations must process personal data lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner with respect to the data subject. This means that data processing activities must have a legal [basis](../b/basis.md), must be conducted in a way that is fair to the individual, and must be transparent about how data is being used.

### Purpose Limitation
Data should be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes. Organizations need to ensure that they clearly define the purpose for data collection and use data only for those specified purposes.

### Data Minimization
Organizations should only collect and process the personal data that is necessary for the specified purpose. This principle encourages organizations to avoid collecting excessive data and to minimize the amount of data they store and process.

### Accuracy
Personal data must be accurate and kept up to date where necessary. Organizations are responsible for taking reasonable steps to ensure that inaccurate data is corrected or deleted.

### Storage Limitation
Personal data should only be kept in a form that allows identification of the data subject for as long as is necessary for the purposes for which the data was collected. This means that organizations need to implement data retention policies and procedures to ensure that data is not kept longer than necessary.

### Integrity and Confidentiality
Organizations must process data in a manner that ensures its [security](../s/security.md), including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction, or damage. This principle emphasizes the importance of [data security](../d/data_security_in_trading.md) measures such as encryption and access controls.

### Accountability
Organizations are responsible for, and must be able to demonstrate compliance with, all other principles. This means that organizations need to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures, keep detailed records of data processing activities, and ensure that they can demonstrate GDPR compliance if required.

## Rights of Data Subjects

GDPR grants individuals various rights over their personal data, empowering them to take control of how their data is used. Some of these rights include:

### Right to Access
Individuals have the right to obtain confirmation as to whether their personal data is being processed, and if so, access to the data along with information about how it is being processed.

### Right to Rectification
Individuals have the right to have inaccurate personal data corrected and to have incomplete data completed.

### Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten)
Individuals can request the deletion of their personal data when it is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected or if they withdraw their consent to processing.

### Right to Restriction of Processing
Individuals can request that the processing of their personal data be restricted under certain conditions, such as when the accuracy of the data is contested or the processing is unlawful.

### Right to Data Portability
Individuals have the right to receive their personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and to have that data transmitted to another controller.

### Right to Object
Individuals can object to the processing of their personal data on grounds relating to their particular situation, and organizations must stop processing the data unless they can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing.

### Rights Related to Automated Decision-Making and Profiling
Individuals have the right not to be subject to decisions based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects or significantly affects them.

## Obligations of Data Controllers and Processors

GDPR places responsibilities and duties on both data [controllers](../c/controller.md) (the entities that determine the purposes and means of processing personal data) and data processors (the entities that process data on behalf of the controller).

### Data Protection by Design and by Default
Organizations must implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure data protection principles are integrated into processing activities and that, by [default](../d/default.md), only necessary personal data is processed.

### Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs)
Before carrying out processing that is likely to result in a high [risk](../r/risk.md) to individuals' rights and freedoms, organizations must conduct DPIAs to assess the impact of the processing operations on personal data protection.

### Data Breach Notification
Organizations must report data breaches to the relevant supervisory authority within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach. If the breach is likely to result in a high [risk](../r/risk.md) to the rights and freedoms of individuals, the affected individuals must also be informed without undue delay.

### Appointment of Data Protection Officers (DPOs)
Organizations engaged in high-[risk](../r/risk.md) processing activities, public authorities, or those systematically monitoring individuals on a large scale must appoint a DPO to oversee GDPR compliance and act as a point of contact with supervisory authorities.

## International Data Transfers

GDPR requires that personal data transferred outside the EU is protected to the same standards as within the EU. This means that organizations must ensure appropriate safeguards are in place before transferring data internationally. These safeguards can include binding corporate rules, standard contractual clauses, or reliance on adequacy decisions by the European [Commission](../c/commission.md) for certain countries.

## Enforcement and Penalties

GDPR is enforced by data protection authorities (DPAs) in each EU member state. These authorities have the power to investigate, correct, and fine organizations for non-compliance. Penalties can be substantial and are designed to be proportionate to the severity of the infringement:

### Tier 1 Fines
For less severe violations, such as failing to maintain adequate records or failing to notify a breach, the maximum fine is up to €10 million or 2% of the annual global [turnover](../t/turnover.md) of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher.

### Tier 2 Fines
For more severe violations, such as processing data without a legal [basis](../b/basis.md) or failing to respect individuals’ rights, the maximum fine is up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global [turnover](../t/turnover.md) of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher.

## Implications for Organizations

Organizations worldwide must comply with GDPR if they [offer](../o/offer.md) goods or services to, or monitor the behavior of, EU data subjects. Non-compliance can lead to significant financial penalties and reputational damage. Therefore, organizations are advised to:

- **Conduct Data Audits**: Assess data collection and processing activities to ensure compliance with GDPR principles.
- **Update Privacy Policies**: Ensure privacy policies clearly explain data processing activities and individuals' rights.
- **Implement [Security](../s/security.md) Measures**: Employ adequate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data.
- **Train Employees**: Educate staff about GDPR requirements and their roles in maintaining compliance.
- **Document Compliance**: Keep detailed records to demonstrate compliance with GDPR requirements.

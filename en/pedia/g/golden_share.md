# Golden Share

A "golden share" is a type of share that gives its holder special voting rights, enabling them to exercise a significant degree of control over the company, beyond what is typically proportionate to their level of equity ownership. This special power is typically used by governments to retain control over privatized companies or in strategic industries where national interest is a consideration. 

## Definition and Features

Golden shares are unique financial instruments that typically possess some of the following features:

1. **Voting Rights:** The golden share often comes with veto power on critical company decisions, such as mergers, acquisitions, and changes in business structure.
2. **Ownership Retention:** Governments or state entities often hold golden shares to retain a foot in privatized companies.
3. **Specific to National Interests:** These shares are commonly used in industries considered strategically important, such as defense, energy, and infrastructure.
4. **Non-transferable:** Golden shares are usually non-transferable, meaning the special rights cannot be sold or traded to another entity.

## Historical Context

The concept of the golden share emerged prominently in the 1980s when various nation-states began to privatize state-owned enterprises. Governments utilized golden shares as a mechanism to retain control over critical industries while allowing private investment and market efficiencies to take root.

### Case Study: The United Kingdom

In the United Kingdom, during Margaret Thatcher's government, golden shares were often issued in privatized utilities like British Gas and British Telecom. These shares allowed the UK government to maintain veto power over any changes that could affect national security or public service obligations.

### Case Study: Portugal

The Portuguese government retained golden shares in several companies during the wave of privatization in the 1990s. For instance, in the energy company EDP (Energias de Portugal), the state kept a golden share to ensure control over significant decisions affecting the nation's energy security.

## Legal and Regulatory Landscape

The legal framework governing golden shares can be complex and varies by jurisdiction. However, golden shares have often been the subject of legal disputes, particularly within the European Union (EU). The EU has stringent rules on market competition and state aid, leading to several high-profile cases where member states' golden shares were challenged.

### European Court of Justice (ECJ) Rulings

The ECJ has ruled in various instances that golden shares constitute a barrier to the free movement of capital and have demanded the removal of such share structures unless they can be justified by overriding reasons of public interest. Examples of such rulings include:

- The 2002 ruling against the Portuguese and Belgian governments in the cases of Companhia de Portugal and Société Nationale de Chemins de Fer.
- The 2003 ruling against France concerning its golden share in the oil company Elf Aquitaine.

## Modern Examples

### France: Renault

The French government retains a golden share in Renault, allowing it to influence decisions that could impact the national economy or workforce significantly.

### Italy: ENI

Italy has maintained a golden share in ENI, a major player in the energy sector. This ensures that critical decisions align with the nation's energy policy and security needs.

## Pros and Cons

### Advantages

1. **National Security:** Ensures control over strategic sectors and protects against hostile takeovers.
2. **Public Interest:** Secures societal and economic interests, particularly in utilities and infrastructure.
3. **Continuity:** Maintains consistency in policy and management of essential services.

### Disadvantages

1. **Investor Deterrence:** May deter foreign investment due to perceived governmental interference.
2. **Market Distortion:** Can lead to inefficiencies and market distortions.
3. **Legal Challenges:** Subject to regulatory scrutiny and potential legal conflicts, particularly within the EU.

## Future Considerations

As market liberalization continues globally, the use of golden shares could either diminish due to increased regulatory scrutiny or evolve into new forms that align with contemporary economic and geopolitical realities.

### Technological Innovation

The rise of digital and technological industries, which also bear strategic importance, might see new iterations of golden share-like mechanisms to balance innovation, investment, and national security.

## Conclusion

Golden shares represent a fascinating intersection of equity control, public policy, and market dynamics. Their continued relevance will likely depend on a nation's economic structure, strategic sectors, and evolving regulatory landscapes. Whether they remain a staple in governance or phase out under market pressures and legal scrutiny is a subject of ongoing debate.

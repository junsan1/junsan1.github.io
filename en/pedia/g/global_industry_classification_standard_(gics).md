# Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS)

The Global [Industry](../i/industry.md) Classification Standard (GICS) is an [industry](../i/industry.md) taxonomy developed in 1999 by MSCI and Standard & Poor's (S&P) for use by the global financial community. The GICS structure consists of 11 sectors, 24 [industry](../i/industry.md) groups, 69 industries, and 158 sub-industries. The classification facilitates a standardized framework that enables [market](../m/market.md) participants to compare companies around the world within the same [industry](../i/industry.md).

## History of GICS

In the late 1990s, the financial community faced a need for a comprehensive and standardized system that would allow better [industry](../i/industry.md) comparison and economic analysis. Developed by Morgan Stanley [Capital](../c/capital.md) International (MSCI) and Standard & Poor's (S&P), GICS was introduced to fill this gap. The main motivation behind GICS was to develop a system that was easily understandable, consistent, and globally accepted. Over the years, GICS has become the most widely used classification system, providing clear [industry](../i/industry.md) definitions for investors and analysts.

## Structure of GICS

GICS is hierarchically structured to provide four levels of classification: sectors, [industry](../i/industry.md) groups, industries, and sub-industries. The hierarchical structure is as follows:

1. **Sectors (11)**
2. **[Industry](../i/industry.md) Groups (24)**
3. **Industries (69)**
4. **Sub-Industries (158)**

### 1. Sectors

The first level of the GICS hierarchy, sectors, is designed to group companies within broader categories that reflect shared economic and social characteristics. The 11 GICS sectors are:

1. **Energy**
2. **Materials**
3. **Industrials**
4. **Consumer Discretionary**
5. **[Consumer Staples](../c/consumer_staples.md)**
6. **Health Care**
7. **Financials**
8. **Information Technology**
9. **Telecommunication Services**
10. **Utilities**
11. **[Real Estate](../r/real_estate.md)**

### 2. Industry Groups

Each sector is divided into [industry](../i/industry.md) groups based on shared operational characteristics. For example:

- The **Energy** sector is divided into:
  - Energy Equipment & Services
  - Oil, Gas & Consumable Fuels
  
- The **Information Technology** sector is divided into:
  - Software & Services
  - Technology Hardware & Equipment
  - Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment

### 3. Industries

The third level details the [industry](../i/industry.md) groups further into more finely tuned industries. Examples include:

- Within **Health Care**, you find industries such as:
  - Health Care Equipment & Supplies
  - Health Care Providers & Services
  - Biotechnology
  - Pharmaceuticals

### 4. Sub-Industries

At the most granular level of GICS are sub-industries. For instance:

- The **Health Care Providers & Services** [industry](../i/industry.md) includes:
  - Health Care Services
  - Health Care Facilities
  - Managed Health Care

Each level of classification provides increasing specificity, allowing investors to perform detailed financial analyses and make more informed investment decisions.

## Importance of GICS in Algo-Trading

Algo-trading, or [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), relies heavily on the ability to categorize and analyze large sets of data efficiently. The standardized format provided by GICS offers several benefits to algo-traders:

1. **Data Consistency**: Using GICS ensures that data is uniformly categorized, aiding in the development of [trading models](../t/trading_models.md).
2. **[Comparative Analysis](../c/comparative_analysis.md)**: Standardized [industry](../i/industry.md) definitions allow for more accurate comparisons of [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md) across companies and sectors.
3. **Sector-based Strategies**: GICS facilitates constructing sector-based [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), allowing traders to focus algorithms on specific sectors or [industry](../i/industry.md) groups.
4. **[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md)**: Historical [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) of [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) becomes more straightforward with standardized data classification, providing robustness and reliability to the models.

## Applications of GICS

Various trading platforms, research firms, and financial institutions use GICS for diverse applications.

### Trading Platforms

Most trading platforms integrate GICS into their systems, allowing traders to filter [stocks](../s/stock.md) and financial instruments based on GICS classifications. This [incorporation](../i/incorporation.md) aids in quick decision-making and strategy development. Examples include:

- **[Bloomberg Terminal](../b/bloomberg_terminal.md)**: Employs GICS-framework for stock categorization.
- **Thomson [Reuters](../r/reuters.md) Eikon**: Uses GICS for analytics and trading functionalities.

### Research and Analysis

Financial analysts use GICS for in-depth research and analysis. The classification system supports generating [industry](../i/industry.md)-specific reports, sector reviews, and economic outlooks.

### Financial Products

GICS aids in constructing financial products such as sector-based ETFs ([Exchange](../e/exchange.md)-Traded Funds). By defining sector boundaries, GICS ensures that ETFs are accurately representative of the sectors they are meant to track.

- **SPDR [Sector ETFs](../s/sector_etfs.md)**: These ETFs are designed around the GICS sectors allowing investors to target specific [industry](../i/industry.md) segments.

### Benchmarking

GICS allows [performance benchmarking](../p/performance_benchmarking.md) of investment portfolios against standard [market](../m/market.md) indices like the S&P 500, MSCI World, etc. Accurate classification enables meaningful comparisons and [performance attribution](../p/performance_attribution.md).

## Evolution and Updates

GICS is continually evolving to reflect the changing landscape of global markets. MSCI and S&P regularly review the classification system, considering [market](../m/market.md) trends and [industry](../i/industry.md) developments. These reviews ensure that GICS remains a relevant and practical tool for investors.

### Historical Changes

- **2016**: Inclusion of the [Real Estate](../r/real_estate.md) sector, separating it from the Financials sector to reflect its growing significance.
- **2018**: Redefinition of the Telecommunication Services sector to include Communication Services, acknowledging the convergence of media and communication.
  
### Recent Changes

- **2022**: Adjustments to sub-industries within the Information [Technology sector](../t/technology_sector.md) to better categorize emerging technologies.

## Challenges and Criticisms

Despite its widespread acceptance, GICS is not without criticisms:

1. **Rigidity**: Some critics argue that the fixed structure may not adapt quickly enough to emerging industries.
2. **Granularity**: Others feel that certain sectors may require more granularity to reflect evolving technologies and [market](../m/market.md) diversities adequately.
3. **Subjectivity**: Decisions on classification can sometimes appear subjective, potentially leading to inconsistencies.

However, the ongoing updates and reviews aim to address these challenges and maintain GICS's robustness and reliability.

## Conclusion

The Global [Industry](../i/industry.md) Classification Standard (GICS) is a critical framework in the financial [industry](../i/industry.md), providing a standardized method for categorizing companies. Through its hierarchical structure, GICS enables clear, consistent, and comprehensive analysis, which is invaluable for algo-traders and the broader financial community. As global markets evolve, GICS continues to adapt, ensuring it remains a relevant and powerful tool for [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md) and trading. The adoption of GICS by trading platforms, [research analysts](../r/research_analysts.md), and financial product developers underscores its significance in facilitating systematic and informed financial decision-making.

# Graduated Payment Mortgage (GPM)

A Graduated [Payment](../p/payment.md) [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) (GPM) is a type of [fixed-rate mortgage](../f/fixed-rate_mortgage.md) designed to assist [home](../h/home.md) buyers whose incomes are expected to increase over time. It is characterized by lower initial monthly payments that gradually increase at set intervals over a specified period, eventually becoming level at a higher [payment](../p/payment.md) amount for the remainder of the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) term. This model is particularly attractive to younger borrowers or those anticipating higher future [earnings](../e/earnings.md).

## Key Features of GPM

### 1. Initial Low Payments
The GPM starts with lower monthly payments compared to traditional fixed-rate mortgages. These payments are set below the [interest](../i/interest.md)-only level, meaning that in the early years, the borrower is not even covering the [interest](../i/interest.md) cost, resulting in [negative amortization](../n/negative_amortization.md).

### 2. Payment Increase Schedule
The payments increase at predetermined intervals. Typically, this increase occurs annually. The amount and frequency of these increases are defined in the [loan](../l/loan.md) agreement, [offering](../o/offering.md) predictability to borrowers.

### 3. Negative Amortization
During the initial phase of lower payments, the difference between the [payment](../p/payment.md) and the [interest](../i/interest.md) due is added to the [loan](../l/loan.md) balance. Therefore, the [loan](../l/loan.md) balance increases during this period instead of decreasing, a process known as [negative amortization](../n/negative_amortization.md).

### 4. Stabilization Period
After the graduated increases, the monthly payments level off and remain fixed at a higher amount for the [duration](../d/duration.md) of the [loan](../l/loan.md). This fixed higher [payment](../p/payment.md) starts once the scheduled increases are completed.

### 5. Fixed Interest Rate
GPMs usually come with a [fixed interest rate](../f/fixed_interest_rate.md), adding a level of predictability regarding the total [interest](../i/interest.md) cost over the life of the [loan](../l/loan.md). However, the effective [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) paid by the borrower during the initial period of [negative amortization](../n/negative_amortization.md) is higher due to the [compounding](../c/compounding.md) of unpaid [interest](../i/interest.md).

## Advantages of GPM

### 1. Affordability
The lower initial payments make the GPM more accessible to borrowers who might otherwise be unable to afford a traditional [fixed-rate mortgage](../f/fixed-rate_mortgage.md). This feature is particularly beneficial for first-time homebuyers or those whose current [income](../i/income.md) is low but expected to increase.

### 2. Predictable Payment Increases
The scheduled [payment](../p/payment.md) increases are known in advance, allowing borrowers to plan their finances accordingly. This predictability can reduce the financial strain as [income](../i/income.md) presumably rises alongside the [payment](../p/payment.md) amounts.

### 3. Potential for Larger Loans
Since the initial payments are lower, borrowers might qualify for larger loans than they would under traditional [fixed-rate mortgage](../f/fixed-rate_mortgage.md) terms. This feature enables the purchase of more expensive homes sooner in the borrower's career.

## Disadvantages of GPM

### 1. Negative Amortization Risk
The initial phase of low payments means the [loan](../l/loan.md) balance can increase significantly due to [negative amortization](../n/negative_amortization.md). Borrowers end up with a larger [debt](../d/debt.md) than they started with, which could pose a [risk](../r/risk.md) if the borrower's [income](../i/income.md) does not increase as expected.

### 2. Higher Long-term Payments
Once the graduated [payment](../p/payment.md) period ends, the monthly payments can be significantly higher than the initial payments. If the borrower's [income](../i/income.md) does not grow as anticipated, this can lead to financial challenges or even [default](../d/default.md).

### 3. Total Interest Paid
The total [interest](../i/interest.md) paid over the life of a GPM can be higher than that of a traditional [fixed-rate mortgage](../f/fixed-rate_mortgage.md). This is due to the combination of [negative amortization](../n/negative_amortization.md) in the early years and the higher [payment](../p/payment.md) amounts later in the term.

## Suitability of GPM

GPMs are most suitable for borrowers who:

- Are early in their careers and expect significant [income](../i/income.md) growth in the future.
- Have a need for lower initial housing costs.
- Are confident in their future earning potential and financial stability.

They are less suitable for borrowers with unpredictable [income](../i/income.md), those nearing retirement, or individuals who may not see substantial [income](../i/income.md) increases in the future.

## Real-World Example

Imagine a young doctor who has just finished medical school and is entering residency. Their current [income](../i/income.md) is lower than what it [will](../w/will.md) be in a few years when they complete their residency and begin practicing fully. A GPM might be an excellent option, allowing them to afford a [home](../h/home.md) now with lower initial payments that they can easily [handle](../h/handle.md) on a resident's salary. As their [income](../i/income.md) increases significantly after residency, they [will](../w/will.md) then be well-positioned to [handle](../h/handle.md) the higher payments.

## Conclusion

The Graduated [Payment](../p/payment.md) [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) is a specialized financial product crafted to align with the anticipated financial growth of the borrower. While it provides a pathway to homeownership earlier than might otherwise be possible, it comes with distinct risks and higher long-term costs. Borrowers considering a GPM must carefully evaluate their long-term [income](../i/income.md) prospects and assess their ability to manage higher payments in the future. With careful planning and realistic expectations, a GPM can be a valuable tool for achieving homeownership in a financially strategic manner.

# Graduated Payment Mortgage (GPM)

A Graduated Payment Mortgage (GPM) is a type of fixed-rate mortgage designed to assist home buyers whose incomes are expected to increase over time. It is characterized by lower initial monthly payments that gradually increase at set intervals over a specified period, eventually becoming level at a higher payment amount for the remainder of the mortgage term. This model is particularly attractive to younger borrowers or those anticipating higher future earnings.

## Key Features of GPM

### 1. Initial Low Payments
The GPM starts with lower monthly payments compared to traditional fixed-rate mortgages. These payments are set below the interest-only level, meaning that in the early years, the borrower is not even covering the interest cost, resulting in negative amortization.

### 2. Payment Increase Schedule
The payments increase at predetermined intervals. Typically, this increase occurs annually. The amount and frequency of these increases are defined in the loan agreement, offering predictability to borrowers.

### 3. Negative Amortization
During the initial phase of lower payments, the difference between the payment and the interest due is added to the loan balance. Therefore, the loan balance increases during this period instead of decreasing, a process known as negative amortization.

### 4. Stabilization Period
After the graduated increases, the monthly payments level off and remain fixed at a higher amount for the duration of the loan. This fixed higher payment starts once the scheduled increases are completed.

### 5. Fixed Interest Rate
GPMs usually come with a fixed interest rate, adding a level of predictability regarding the total interest cost over the life of the loan. However, the effective interest rate paid by the borrower during the initial period of negative amortization is higher due to the compounding of unpaid interest.

## Advantages of GPM

### 1. Affordability
The lower initial payments make the GPM more accessible to borrowers who might otherwise be unable to afford a traditional fixed-rate mortgage. This feature is particularly beneficial for first-time homebuyers or those whose current income is low but expected to increase.

### 2. Predictable Payment Increases
The scheduled payment increases are known in advance, allowing borrowers to plan their finances accordingly. This predictability can reduce the financial strain as income presumably rises alongside the payment amounts.

### 3. Potential for Larger Loans
Since the initial payments are lower, borrowers might qualify for larger loans than they would under traditional fixed-rate mortgage terms. This feature enables the purchase of more expensive homes sooner in the borrower's career.

## Disadvantages of GPM

### 1. Negative Amortization Risk
The initial phase of low payments means the loan balance can increase significantly due to negative amortization. Borrowers end up with a larger debt than they started with, which could pose a risk if the borrower's income does not increase as expected.

### 2. Higher Long-term Payments
Once the graduated payment period ends, the monthly payments can be significantly higher than the initial payments. If the borrower's income does not grow as anticipated, this can lead to financial challenges or even default.

### 3. Total Interest Paid
The total interest paid over the life of a GPM can be higher than that of a traditional fixed-rate mortgage. This is due to the combination of negative amortization in the early years and the higher payment amounts later in the term.

## Suitability of GPM

GPMs are most suitable for borrowers who:

- Are early in their careers and expect significant income growth in the future.
- Have a need for lower initial housing costs.
- Are confident in their future earning potential and financial stability.

They are less suitable for borrowers with unpredictable income, those nearing retirement, or individuals who may not see substantial income increases in the future.

## Real-World Example

Imagine a young doctor who has just finished medical school and is entering residency. Their current income is lower than what it will be in a few years when they complete their residency and begin practicing fully. A GPM might be an excellent option, allowing them to afford a home now with lower initial payments that they can easily handle on a resident's salary. As their income increases significantly after residency, they will then be well-positioned to handle the higher payments.

## Conclusion

The Graduated Payment Mortgage is a specialized financial product crafted to align with the anticipated financial growth of the borrower. While it provides a pathway to homeownership earlier than might otherwise be possible, it comes with distinct risks and higher long-term costs. Borrowers considering a GPM must carefully evaluate their long-term income prospects and assess their ability to manage higher payments in the future. With careful planning and realistic expectations, a GPM can be a valuable tool for achieving homeownership in a financially strategic manner.

# General Business Tax Credit

The General [Business](../b/business.md) [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md) (GBTC) is a vital fiscal incentive designed to support businesses in the United States. It encompasses a variety of individual tax credits available to businesses, which are compiled into a single, consolidated [credit](../c/credit.md) to simplify the filing process and to encourage a diverse [range](../r/range.md) of [business activities](../b/business_activities.md). This guide delves into the specifics of the GBTC, its components, eligibility criteria, calculation, and the filing process.

## Overview of General Business Tax Credit

The GBTC is not a single [tax credit](../t/tax_credit.md) but rather a collection of various credits that businesses can use to [offset](../o/offset.md) their tax liabilities, promoting [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) and opportunity through targeted incentives. The objective of these credits is to encourage businesses to engage in certain activities that lawmakers have deemed beneficial for the [economy](../e/economy.md), such as research and development (R&D), renewable energy investments, and hiring individuals from targeted groups.

## Components of the General Business Tax Credit

The GBTC includes numerous individual credits, each catering to different [business activities](../b/business_activities.md) and investments. Some of the primary credits included are:

### 1. Research and Development (R&D) Tax Credit

This [credit](../c/credit.md) supports companies that invest in innovation through research and development. Qualified research expenses (QREs) such as wages, supplies, and testing costs related to the development of new or improved [business](../b/business.md) components can be claimed.

### 2. Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC)

The WOTC incentivizes employers to hire individuals from certain targeted groups that have historically faced significant barriers to employment, including veterans, ex-felons, and long-term unemployed individuals.

### 3. Investment Credit

This [credit](../c/credit.md) applies to investments in certain types of [tangible personal property](../t/tangible_personal_property.md), including machinery, equipment, and buildings.

### 4. Renewable Electricity Production Credit

Offered to encourage investment in renewable energy, this [credit](../c/credit.md) provides financial benefits for electricity produced from qualified energy resources such as wind, solar, and geothermal energy.

### 5. Disabled Access Credit

Designed for small businesses, this [credit](../c/credit.md) assists enterprises in making their facilities accessible to individuals with disabilities.

### 6. Empowerment Zone Employment Credit

This [credit](../c/credit.md) is available to businesses that operate in empowerment zones, which are areas designated as economically distressed. The [credit](../c/credit.md) incentivizes hiring and improving [economics](../e/economics.md) within these zones.

### 7. Employer-Provided Child Care Credit

Businesses that provide child care facilities and services to their employees can benefit from this [credit](../c/credit.md), which underscores the importance of work-life balance and child support.

## Eligibility Criteria for GBTC

The eligibility for each component of the GBTC varies, but there are some general considerations to keep in mind:

### General Requirements

1. **Qualified [Business](../b/business.md)**: Your [business](../b/business.md) must generally be engaged in [trade](../t/trade.md) or [business activities](../b/business_activities.md).
2. **Qualifying Activities**: The [business](../b/business.md) must participate in specific activities as defined by each individual [credit](../c/credit.md) (e.g., R&D activities, hiring from targeted groups).
3. **Financial Thresholds**: Some credits have caps on claimed expenses or require a minimum threshold of investment or expenditure.
4. **Timing**: The relevant activities must have taken place within the taxable year for which the [credit](../c/credit.md) is being claimed.

### Specific Qualifications

For the R&D [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md), businesses must conduct activities that meet the four-part test:
1. **Permitted Purpose**: Develop a new or improved [business](../b/business.md) component to function, performance, reliability, or quality.
2. **Elimination of [Uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md)**: The development must aim to eliminate [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) about the capability or method of the process.
3. **Process of Experimentation**: It must involve a process of experimentation including evaluating alternatives through modeling, [simulation](../s/simulation_in_trading.md), or testing.
4. **Technological in Nature**: Activities must rely on hard sciences like engineering or physical sciences.

## Calculating the General Business Tax Credit

Calculating the GBTC involves aggregating the credits from eligible activities. Below are steps typically involved:

### Step 1: Identify Eligible Credits

Determine which credits your [business](../b/business.md) qualifies for among those available under the GBTC.

### Step 2: Calculate Each Individual Credit

Each [credit](../c/credit.md) has specific formulas and methods for calculation. For instance, the R&D [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md) calculation involves figuring out the qualifying research expenses (QREs) and applying the appropriate percentage.

### Step 3: Aggregate the Credits

Combine the calculated credits into a single figure. This combined [value](../v/value.md) [will](../w/will.md) be the aggregated GBTC [value](../v/value.md) you report on your [tax return](../t/tax_return.md).

### Step 4: Apply Limitations

Certain limitations may apply, such as ceilings on how much can be claimed or restrictions on the use of carryovers.

# Goodwill Impairment

[Goodwill](../g/goodwill.md) [impairment](../i/impairment.md) refers to the reduction in the recognized [value](../v/value.md) of [goodwill](../g/goodwill.md), which is an [intangible asset](../i/intangible_asset.md) representing the portion of a [business](../b/business.md) [value](../v/value.md) that cannot be attributed to other [business](../b/business.md) assets. [Goodwill](../g/goodwill.md) is categorized under intangible assets on the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) and often arises in acquisitions when the purchase price exceeds the [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) of the net identifiable assets of an acquired company. [Goodwill](../g/goodwill.md) [impairment](../i/impairment.md) occurs when the carrying amount of [goodwill](../g/goodwill.md) exceeds its [fair value](../f/fair_value.md), necessitating a [write-down](../w/write-down.md).

## Key Concepts in Goodwill Impairment

### Goodwill

[Goodwill](../g/goodwill.md) typically encompasses elements such as [customer](../c/customer.md) loyalty, brand reputation, employee relations, and proprietary technology that are not separately identifiable or measurable. Unlike most intangible assets, [goodwill](../g/goodwill.md) does not have a finite [useful life](../u/useful_life.md) and is not amortized but is instead tested annually for [impairment](../i/impairment.md).

### Impairment Testing

[Goodwill](../g/goodwill.md) [impairment](../i/impairment.md) testing is the process of evaluating the carrying amount of [goodwill](../g/goodwill.md) to determine if it has suffered a loss in [value](../v/value.md). The two primary methods of conducting [impairment](../i/impairment.md) testing are:

1. **Qualitative Assessment (Step Zero)**: This preliminary step evaluates whether it’s likely that the [goodwill](../g/goodwill.md) might be impaired. Factors such as macroeconomic conditions, [industry](../i/industry.md) and [market](../m/market.md) considerations, cost factors, and overall [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) are analyzed.

2. **Quantitative Assessment**:
   - **Step One**: Compare the [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) of the reporting unit (the smallest unit to which [goodwill](../g/goodwill.md) can be allocated) to its carrying amount, including [goodwill](../g/goodwill.md). 
   - **Step Two**: If the [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the implied [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) of the reporting unit’s [goodwill](../g/goodwill.md) is calculated. The [impairment](../i/impairment.md) loss is the difference between the carrying amount and the implied [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) of [goodwill](../g/goodwill.md).

### Reporting Unit

A reporting unit is a level of organization at which [business activities](../b/business_activities.md) are monitored and evaluated. Reporting units may consist of one or more operating segments, or a segment of a larger division. The [impairment](../i/impairment.md) test must be performed on the reporting unit to which [goodwill](../g/goodwill.md) is assigned.

### Fair Value

[Fair value](../f/fair_value.md) is defined as the price that would be received to sell an [asset](../a/asset.md) or paid to transfer a [liability](../l/liability.md) in an orderly [transaction](../t/transaction.md) between [market](../m/market.md) participants at the measurement date. This involves using [market](../m/market.md) data, financial projections, and discounted [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) analysis.

### Indicators of Goodwill Impairment

Several signs may indicate potential [goodwill](../g/goodwill.md) [impairment](../i/impairment.md):
- Declining cash flows
- Adverse changes in [market](../m/market.md) conditions or regulations
- A reduction in stock price
- Increased competition leading to declining [market share](../m/market_share.md)
- [Restructuring](../r/restructuring.md) activities or significant changes in management strategy 

## Impairment Testing Process

1. **Identification of Reporting Units**: Define and allocate [goodwill](../g/goodwill.md) and other assets to respective reporting units.
  
2. **Conduct a Qualitative Assessment**: Consider qualitative factors to ascertain the likelihood of [impairment](../i/impairment.md).
  
3. **[Quantitative Analysis](../q/quantitative_analysis.md) – Step One**:
   - Measure the [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) of the reporting unit.
   - Compare the [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) to the carrying amount, including [goodwill](../g/goodwill.md).

4. **[Quantitative Analysis](../q/quantitative_analysis.md) – Step Two** (if necessary):
   - Determine the implied [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) of [goodwill](../g/goodwill.md).
   - Compute any [impairment](../i/impairment.md) loss as the excess carrying [value](../v/value.md) over the implied [fair value](../f/fair_value.md).

## Goodwill Impairment Accounting

### Journal Entries

When [goodwill](../g/goodwill.md) [impairment](../i/impairment.md) is recognized, it is recorded as a loss in the [income statement](../i/income_statement.md), reducing the net [income](../i/income.md). The corresponding adjustment is a decrease in the [goodwill](../g/goodwill.md) account. A simplified [journal](../j/journal.md) entry would look as follows:

```markdown
    Dr. [Goodwill](../g/goodwill.md) [Impairment](../i/impairment.md) Loss ([Income Statement](../i/income_statement.md))
         Cr. [Goodwill](../g/goodwill.md) ([Balance Sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md))
```

### Financial Reporting Implications

[Goodwill](../g/goodwill.md) [impairment](../i/impairment.md) can significantly impact the [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md). Investors and analysts often scrutinize these [impairment](../i/impairment.md) charges as indicators of potential [underlying](../u/underlying.md) problems. Persistent [impairment](../i/impairment.md) losses may raise concerns about the overall strategic direction and operational effectiveness.

## Examples of Goodwill Impairment

**General Electric (GE)**
- In 2018, GE recorded a [goodwill](../g/goodwill.md) [impairment](../i/impairment.md) charge of $22 billion related to its power [business](../b/business.md). The charge reflected deteriorating [market](../m/market.md) conditions and a reassessment of the [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) of the reporting unit: [GE 2018 Annual Report](https://www.ge.com/reports/2018-annual-report/).

**Kraft Heinz**
- Kraft Heinz took a [goodwill](../g/goodwill.md) [impairment](../i/impairment.md) charge of $15.4 billion in 2019 due to challenges in meeting consumer [demand](../d/demand.md) and reevaluation of the long-term growth rate: [Kraft Heinz 2019 Annual Report](https://www.kraftheinzcompany.com/sites/g/files/yec346/f/2020-04/KHC_2019_Annual_Report.pdf).

**Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL)**
- In 2020, JLL reported a [goodwill](../g/goodwill.md) [impairment](../i/impairment.md) of $240 million triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on [commercial real estate](../c/commercial_real_estate.md) profitability: [JLL 2020 Annual Report](https://ir.jll.com/annual-reports-and-proxy).

## Regulatory Framework

[Goodwill](../g/goodwill.md) [impairment](../i/impairment.md) is governed by [accounting](../a/accounting.md) standards set by regulatory bodies such as:

- **[Financial Accounting](../f/financial_accounting.md) Standards Board (FASB)**: U.S. GAAP under ASC 350.
- **International [Accounting](../a/accounting.md) Standards Board (IASB)**: International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) under IAS 36.

## Recent Trends and Developments

### COVID-19 Pandemic

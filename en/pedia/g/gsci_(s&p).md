# GSCI (S&P)

The S&P GSCI (formerly the Goldman Sachs [Commodity](../c/commodity.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md)) is a widely recognized, broad-based, production-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md) that measures the performance of the global commodities [market](../m/market.md). This [index](../i/index_instrument.md) was created by Goldman Sachs in 1991 to serve as a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for investment in the [commodity](../c/commodity.md) markets and was later acquired by Standard & Poor's (S&P) in 2007. The [index](../i/index_instrument.md) reflects the price changes and returns constituents like energy products, metals, agriculture, livestock, and other commodities, making it a valuable tool for investors and analysts.

## Components and Structure
The S&P GSCI comprises 24 [exchange](../e/exchange.md)-traded [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) representing 24 different commodities spanning across five sectors: energy, industrial metals, precious metals, agriculture, and livestock. It is designed to be a diversified and global [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) of the commodities [market](../m/market.md). The weight of each [commodity](../c/commodity.md) in the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) is determined based on its global production levels, which is recalculated annually to ensure the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) presents an accurate view of the [market](../m/market.md).

### Energy Sector
Energy commodities constitute a significant portion of the S&P GSCI, making it highly sensitive to changes in the energy markets. This includes [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md), refined products, natural gas, and other energy-related [futures](../f/futures.md).

### Industrial Metals
The industrial metals sector covers commodities such as aluminum, copper, lead, nickel, and zinc. Industrial metals are critical for construction, [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md), and various other industries, making their performance essential to the global [economy](../e/economy.md).

### Precious Metals
Precious metals like gold and silver also form part of the [index](../i/index_instrument.md). These commodities are often seen as safe-haven assets and are used in a variety of applications, including jewelry, electronics, and as reserves by central banks.

### Agriculture
The agriculture sector includes a [range](../r/range.md) of commodities, like wheat, corn, soybeans, coffee, sugar, and cotton. These commodities are essential for food production, textile [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md), and other industries.

### Livestock
Livestock commodities include live cattle, feeder cattle, and lean hogs. These are vital components of the agriculture [industry](../i/industry.md) and are driven by factors like feed costs, disease outbreaks, and changing consumer preferences.

## Calculation of the Index
The calculation of the S&P GSCI involves [multiple](../m/multiple.md) steps, reflecting price changes of its constituent [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md). Each [commodity](../c/commodity.md)'s impact on the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) is a function of their world production weight and the [commodity](../c/commodity.md)'s current price. This makes it a production-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md) rather than a price-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) or [value](../v/value.md)-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md).

### Rolling Mechanism
The S&P GSCI uses a rolling mechanism to ensure continuous exposure to commodities contracts, as [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) are subject to expiration. Typically, the rolling process takes place over a five-day period every month, shifting from the near-month contract to the next specified contract.

## Historical Performance
Historically, the S&P GSCI has shown a [correlation](../c/correlation.md) with [inflation](../i/inflation.md), effectively providing a [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against rising prices. It has also demonstrated periods of significant [volatility](../v/volatility.md), driven largely by sharp movements in the [energy sector](../e/energy_sector.md). This [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and its components' cyclical nature require careful consideration from investors using the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) as an investment tool.

## Applications
The S&P GSCI is utilized for various purposes:
- **Benchmarking**: It's used by investors and [fund](../f/fund.md) managers to [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) the performance of commodities investment portfolios.
- **Financial Products**: Numerous financial products, such as ETFs and ETNs, are directly linked to the performance of the S&P GSCI, providing an accessible way for retail and institutional investors to [gain](../g/gain.md) exposure to the commodities [market](../m/market.md).
- **Economic Analysis**: Analysts often use the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) to study [commodity](../c/commodity.md) price trends and their broader economic implications.

## Risks and Considerations
[Investing](../i/investing.md) in commodities through the S&P GSCI carries several risks and considerations:
- **[Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: The [index](../i/index_instrument.md) can experience significant price swings, particularly due to the high weight of energy commodities.
- **[Commodity](../c/commodity.md)-Specific Risks**: Different commodities within the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) have unique [risk factors](../r/risk_factors_in_trading.md) such as geopolitical events, weather conditions, and changes in [industry](../i/industry.md) [demand](../d/demand.md).
- **Rolling Costs**: The cost associated with the rolling mechanism in [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) can impact overall returns.

## Investment Vehicles
Several investment vehicles track the performance of the S&P GSCI, [offering](../o/offering.md) investors various means to [gain](../g/gain.md) exposure:
- **[Exchange](../e/exchange.md)-Traded Notes (ETNs)**: [Debt](../d/debt.md) securities that provide returns based on the performance of the [index](../i/index_instrument.md).
- **[Exchange](../e/exchange.md)-Traded Funds (ETFs)**: Funds that [hold](../h/hold.md) investments in [commodity futures](../c/commodity_futures.md) contracts to mimic the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) performance.
- **Mutual Funds**: Actively managed or passive funds tracking the S&P GSCI composition.

## Future of S&P GSCI
With the growing [interest](../i/interest.md) in sustainable and environmental investments, the future of the S&P GSCI might involve modifications to incorporate ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) criteria, ensuring the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) continues to meet the evolving demands of the investment community.

# Gifts Causa Mortis

Gifts causa mortis, also known as deathbed gifts, are a particular category of gifts that occur when a donor gives an [asset](../a/asset.md) or property to someone else in anticipation of the donor's imminent death. This legal concept has historical roots and varies across jurisdictions, but generally, it encompasses certain key elements that differentiate it from ordinary gifts or testamentary bequests.

## Definition and Characteristics

A gift causa mortis is a gift made by a donor who expects to die imminently. The essential elements of such a gift typically include:

1. **Intention**: The donor must intend to make a gift that is effective upon their anticipated death.
2. **Expectation of Imminent Death**: The donor must believe that their death is imminent, often due to illness or a perilous situation.
3. **Delivery**: There must be an actual or symbolic delivery of the gift to the recipient.
4. **Acceptance**: The recipient must accept the gift during the donor’s lifetime.
5. **Condition Subsequent**: The gift is conditional upon the donor’s death; if the donor survives the anticipated peril, the gift is revoked automatically.

## Historical Context

The concept of gifts causa mortis can be traced back to Roman law. It provided a way for individuals to transfer property in the face of death without undergoing the formalities of a [will](../w/will.md). Over centuries, this concept has evolved and been integrated into [common law](../c/common_law.md), retaining its fundamental principles while adapting to modern legal frameworks.

## Legal Framework

### United States

In the United States, gifts causa mortis are recognized in most jurisdictions but are subject to strict scrutiny due to their conditional and revocable nature. Courts tend to apply a high standard of proof to ensure that the elements of such a gift are clearly met. The Uniform [Probate](../p/probate.md) Code (UPC), adopted in various forms by many states, also addresses gifts causa mortis.

### United Kingdom

In the UK, the concept of gifts causa mortis (often referred to as donatio mortis causa) is also recognized but treated with caution. English law requires clear evidence of the donor’s intention, delivery, and acceptance under the contemplation of death.

### Other Jurisdictions

Many civil law countries have similar provisions under different names, often incorporated within their inheritance laws. The specifics can vary significantly, reflecting each jurisdiction’s unique legal traditions and values.

## Key Cases and Examples

### Example 1: Death from Illness

Suppose a person diagnosed with a terminal illness hands over their cherished family heirloom to a trusted friend, explicitly stating that the gift is made in the expectation of imminent death due to the illness. If the donor dies from the illness, the heirloom transfer is considered a gift causa mortis.

### Example 2: Perilous Situation

Imagine a soldier on the battlefield giving their watch to a fellow soldier, expressing that if they do not survive the imminent engagement, the watch should be kept by the fellow soldier. If the donor soldier dies in battle, the watch is considered a gift causa mortis, provided all other elements are satisfied.

## Revocation and Controversies

### Automatic Revocation

The inherent conditional nature means that if the donor survives the peril, the gift causa mortis is automatically revoked. For instance, if the donor mentioned in the illness example recovers, the family heirloom must be returned.

### Legal Disputes

Due to the lack of formal documentation and the high stakes involved, gifts causa mortis often lead to legal disputes. Heirs or potential beneficiaries of the donor’s [estate](../e/estate.md) may challenge the validity of such gifts, leading to litigation. Courts typically require strong evidence to [uphold](../u/uphold.md) a gift causa mortis, aiming to protect against [fraud](../f/fraud.md) and [undue influence](../u/undue_influence.md).

## Modern Relevance

In contemporary legal practice, gifts causa mortis remain relevant but are less common than other [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md) tools due to advancements in legal, medical, and [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md). Modern practices prefer more structured approaches like:

- **Wills**: Formal declarations of [asset](../a/asset.md) [distribution](../d/distribution.md) upon death.
- **Living Trusts**: Allow assets to be managed and distributed according to the [trust](../t/trust.md) terms without [probate](../p/probate.md).
- **Durable [Power of Attorney](../p/power_of_attorney.md)**: Designates a person to make decisions if the donor is incapacitated.

## Conclusion

Gifts causa mortis represent a unique blend of historical tradition and contemporary legal principles. They [offer](../o/offer.md) a way for individuals facing imminent death to transfer property efficiently. However, due to their conditional and ephemeral nature, such gifts require stringent legal oversight to prevent abuse and ensure genuine intent. As legal systems evolve, the principles governing gifts causa mortis continue to adapt, reflecting both the legal heritage and the practical needs of modern [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md).

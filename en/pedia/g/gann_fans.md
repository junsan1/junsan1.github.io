# Gann Fans

Gann Fans are a [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) tool used by traders and analysts in [forecasting](../f/forecasting.md) prices in the [stock market](../s/stock_market.md) and other [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). Named after W.D. Gann, a [finance](../f/finance.md) [trader](../t/trader.md) who developed several [technical analysis tools](../t/technical_analysis_tools.md) and techniques, Gann Fans are part of his comprehensive system of [forecasting](../f/forecasting.md) [market](../m/market.md) movements using geometric angles and time cycles. Gann Fans can be employed to predict potential areas of [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) and to gauge the strength and direction of a [trend](../t/trend.md). This technique integrates mathematics, geometry, and [market](../m/market.md) psychology to provide actionable trading insights.

## Concept and Construction

Gann Fans are constructed by drawing lines at specific angles from a particular point, usually a high or low on a price chart. These lines are intended to represent different angles of [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md), helping traders visualize how price moves relative to different slopes. The core principle [underlying](../u/underlying.md) Gann Fans is that price movements unfold in predictable geometric patterns over time, and the key lines in the fan are often referred to as [Gann Angles](../g/gann_angles.md).

The most commonly used angles in a Gann Fan are:

- 1x1 (45 degrees) – This is considered the most important angle, and according to Gann, when the price is above this line, it is in a strong [bull market](../b/bull_market.md), and when below it, in a [bear market](../b/bear_market.md).
- 1x2 (26.25 degrees)
- 2x1 (63.75 degrees)
- 1x3 (18.75 degrees)
- 3x1 (71.25 degrees)
- 1x4 (15 degrees)
- 4x1 (75 degrees)
- 1x8 (7.5 degrees)
- 8x1 (82.5 degrees)

These angles are drawn from a significant high or low point to map out potential [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels as the price unfolds.

## Application in Trading

### Identifying Trends
Gann Fans can help identify the primary [trend](../t/trend.md) direction in a [market](../m/market.md). When the price remains above a critical Gann angle, it is viewed as being in an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md). Conversely, if the price is below a key Gann angle, it indicates a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md). The price’s interaction with these angles can provide valuable insight into the [trend](../t/trend.md)’s strength and possible turning points.

### Support and Resistance Levels
Each angle in a Gann Fan represents a potential support or resistance level. Traders watch how prices interact with these lines. For instance, a price bouncing off a 1x2 angle might find support at this level, indicating a potential buying opportunity. If the price breaks below a critical angle, it may signal a [reversal](../r/reversal.md) or a weakening [trend](../t/trend.md).

### Timing of Trades
Gann Fans can be used to time trades by analyzing the price’s interaction with [Gann angles](../g/gann_angles.md). If the price breaks above a downward sloping Gann angle, it might be an indication of a [trend reversal](../t/trend_reversal.md), suggesting a potential buy signal. Conversely, if the price falls below an upward sloping angle, it might indicate a sell signal.

## Calculation of Angles

To construct a Gann Fan, the angles are drawn on a price chart with respect to the time and price units:

1. **Find a Significant Point:** Identify a significant high or low in the price chart. This is the point from which the Gann Fan [will](../w/will.md) be drawn.
2. **Price and Time Units:** Determine the price units and time intervals. Gann fans can be adapted to different scales and time frames.
3. **Draw Angles:** From the chosen point, use the predetermined angles to draw lines representing possible [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels. Tools such as trading platforms often have built-in tools for drawing Gann Fans, making it easier to plot these angles accurately.

## Practical Example

Let’s say a [trader](../t/trader.md) is analyzing the stock of Company XYZ. The stock has recently made a significant low, and the [trader](../t/trader.md) decides to draw a Gann Fan from this low point. The 1x1 angle (45 degrees) is drawn, along with other relevant angles like 2x1 and 1x2.

- If the price begins to rise and breaks through the 2x1 angle, this may indicate strong upward [momentum](../m/momentum.md).
- If the price tests the 1x1 angle from above and manages to stay above, it might reinforce the bullish [trend](../t/trend.md).
- Conversely, if the price falls below the 1x1 angle and especially below the 1x2 angle, it could be a warning of a potential [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md).

By monitoring how the price interacts with the [Gann angles](../g/gann_angles.md), the [trader](../t/trader.md) can make informed decisions about when to enter or exit trades.

## Limitations and Considerations

1. **Subjectivity:** The application of Gann Fans involves a degree of subjectivity, particularly in choosing the starting point and scaling the chart. Different traders might draw their angles differently, leading to variations in interpretation.
2. **[Market](../m/market.md) Conditions:** Gann Fans might not perform well in highly volatile or irregular markets where [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels are frequently breached. The effectiveness of Gann Fans can vary depending on the [market](../m/market.md) condition.
3. **Complementary Tools:** Gann Fans are best used in conjunction with other [technical analysis tools](../t/technical_analysis_tools.md). Relying solely on Gann Fans without considering other indicators like moving averages, RSI, or MACD could lead to suboptimal trading decisions.
4. **[Learning Curve](../l/learning_curve.md)**: Mastering Gann techniques can be challenging for new traders. Understanding how to correctly draw and interpret Gann Fans requires practice and a good grasp of [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) basics.

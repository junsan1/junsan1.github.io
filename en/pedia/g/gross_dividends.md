# Gross Dividends

Gross dividends refer to the total amount of [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payments made by a [corporation](../c/corporation.md) to its shareholders before any deductions, such as [taxes](../t/taxes.md) or other fees. Dividends are generally distributed from the company's [earnings](../e/earnings.md) and can be issued in the form of cash payments, [shares](../s/shares.md) of stock, or other property. 

## Understanding Dividends

Dividends are a portion of a company's [earnings](../e/earnings.md) distributed to shareholders as a reward for their investment. They can be contrasted with [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md), which remain in the company's reserves to [finance](../f/finance.md) further growth or manage debts. The decision to pay dividends, the amount, and the frequency of [distribution](../d/distribution.md) is made by the company's board of directors and approved by shareholders.

## Types of Dividends

1. **Cash Dividends**: The most common type of dividends, which involve direct payments in cash to the shareholders.
2. **Stock Dividends**: Payments made in the form of additional [shares](../s/shares.md), rather than cash.
3. **Property Dividends**: Dividends paid in the form of assets other than cash or stock, such as physical assets.
4. **Special Dividends**: One-time dividends that are typically larger than regular dividends, often distributed when a company has accumulated substantial profits.

## Tax Implications

Gross dividends are subject to [taxation](../t/taxation.md). The specifics vary by jurisdiction, but dividends can be taxed at the corporate level when [earnings](../e/earnings.md) are taxed, and again at the individual level when dividends are distributed to shareholders (known as [double taxation](../d/double_taxation.md)). Understanding the gross dividends amount before these deductions is essential for both corporations and investors to plan for tax liabilities.

## Gross vs. Net Dividends

- **Gross Dividends**: The full amount declared by the company before any [withholding tax](../w/withholding_tax.md), fees, or expenses are deducted.
- **Net Dividends**: The amount received by shareholders after all applicable [taxes](../t/taxes.md) and fees have been deducted.

## Corporate Policy on Dividends

Companies adopt different [dividend](../d/dividend.md) policies based on their specific circumstances and strategic objectives:

1. **[Residual Dividend](../r/residual_dividend.md) Policy**: Dividends are paid out from the remaining profits after all operational and [expansion](../e/expansion.md) costs are covered.
2. **Stable [Dividend Policy](../d/dividend_policy.md)**: A fixed and predictable [dividend](../d/dividend.md) amount is paid regularly, helping to provide a constant [income](../i/income.md) stream for shareholders.
3. **Hybrid [Dividend Policy](../d/dividend_policy.md)**: Combines elements of both residual and stable policies, allowing for flexible yet relatively predictable dividends.

## Dividend Yield and Payout Ratio

- **[Dividend Yield](../d/dividend_yield.md)**: A financial ratio that shows how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative to its stock price. It is calculated as:
  
  \[
  \text{[Dividend Yield](../d/dividend_yield.md)} = \frac{\text{Annual Dividends per Share}}{\text{Price per Share}}
  \]

- **[Dividend Payout Ratio](../d/dividend_payout_ratio.md)**: This ratio measures the proportion of [earnings](../e/earnings.md) distributed as dividends to shareholders, calculated as:

  \[
  \text{[Dividend Payout Ratio](../d/dividend_payout_ratio.md)} = \frac{\text{Dividends per Share}}{\text{[Earnings](../e/earnings.md) per Share}}
  \]

## Significance for Investors

Gross dividends provide investors with insights into the earning potential and [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) of a company. Companies that consistently pay substantial dividends are often viewed as financially stable and profitable, making them attractive to [income](../i/income.md)-focused investors. However, the sustainability of [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payments is crucial, and potential investors should assess whether the company can continue paying these dividends without jeopardizing its growth or [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).

## Example: AT&T Inc.

AT&T Inc. (https://www.att.com) is a prominent example of a company that has a history of paying regular and substantial dividends to its shareholders. As an established player in the telecommunications [industry](../i/industry.md), it provides insights into how large, stable companies approach gross [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payments to reward their investors.

## Conclusion

Gross dividends represent the total [earnings](../e/earnings.md) distributed to shareholders before deductions, acting as a crucial metric for understanding a company's [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and [return](../r/return.md) on investment for potential and current investors. By examining gross dividends, investors can [gain](../g/gain.md) deeper insights into a company's profitability, stability, and future prospects, while also planning for tax [obligations](../o/obligation.md) associated with their [investment income](../i/investment_income.md). Understanding the various [dividend](../d/dividend.md) policies, their implications, and real-world examples like AT&T offers a comprehensive view of how gross dividends impact both corporations and individual investors.

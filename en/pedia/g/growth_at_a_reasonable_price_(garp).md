# Growth at a Reasonable Price (GARP)

**Growth at a Reasonable Price (GARP)** is an [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) that combines qualities of both [growth investing](../g/growth_investing.md) and [value investing](../v/value_investing.md). The principle behind GARP is to find [stocks](../s/stock.md) that are anticipated to grow [earnings](../e/earnings.md) at an above-average rate but whose valuations are still reasonable given their growth prospects. The GARP strategy helps investors balance the potentially high returns of [growth investing](../g/growth_investing.md) with the [risk](../r/risk.md) mitigation of [value investing](../v/value_investing.md) by focusing on companies with solid growth potential that are not [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md).

### Fundamental Principles of GARP

1. **Growth Metrics:**
   - **[Earnings](../e/earnings.md) Per Share (EPS) Growth:** Investors look for companies with a consistent and strong EPS growth, generally at a rate of 10%-20% per year.
   - **[Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Growth:** Similar to EPS, [revenue](../r/revenue.md) growth is another critical metric. Sustained [revenue](../r/revenue.md) growth indicates that the company is successfully expanding its [customer](../c/customer.md) base and [market](../m/market.md) reach.
   
2. **[Valuation](../v/valuation.md) Metrics:**
   - **Price-to-[Earnings](../e/earnings.md) Ratio (P/E Ratio):** Unlike pure growth investors who might ignore high P/E ratios, GARP investors are more cautious. They typically look for P/E ratios that are below the aggregate of their [earnings](../e/earnings.md) growth rate.
   - **PEG Ratio (Price/[Earnings](../e/earnings.md) to Growth):** GARP investors place significant importance on the PEG ratio, which adjusts the P/E ratio by [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for the company's growth rate. A PEG ratio under 1 generally indicates that the stock might be [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) relative to its growth potential.

3. **Other Financial Metrics:**
   - **[Return](../r/return.md) on [Equity](../e/equity.md) (ROE):** High ROE indicates efficient use of shareholdersâ€™ [equity](../e/equity.md) to generate profits.
   - **[Debt](../d/debt.md)-to-[Equity](../e/equity.md) Ratio:** A lower [debt](../d/debt.md)-to-[equity](../e/equity.md) ratio suggests that the company is not heavily reliant on [debt](../d/debt.md) to [finance](../f/finance.md) its growth.

### Characteristics of GARP Companies

- **Strong Fundamentals:** GARP companies exhibit solid [financial health](../f/financial_health.md), including [robust](../r/robust.md) [earnings](../e/earnings.md), [revenue](../r/revenue.md) growth, and [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md).
- **[Competitive Advantage](../c/competitive_advantage.md):** These companies typically possess a sustainable [competitive advantage](../c/competitive_advantage.md), which could be through intellectual property, brand reputation, or unique products.
- **Moderate [Valuation](../v/valuation.md):** Reasonable P/E and PEG ratios that suggest the stock is not overly expensive relative to its [earnings](../e/earnings.md) growth potential.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of GARP

**Advantages:**
- **Balanced Approach:** The GARP strategy aims to balance high growth potential with reasonable valuations, thereby potentially reducing [risk](../r/risk.md) while still achieving significant returns.
- **Flexibility:** GARP investors can adapt their portfolios in both bullish and bearish markets by selecting companies that fit the GARP criteria.
- **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Mitigation:** By avoiding overly expensive [stocks](../s/stock.md), GARP investors mitigate the [risk](../r/risk.md) of significant price corrections.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Limited Universe:** The GARP criteria can significantly narrow the pool of suitable investments, making it challenging to diversify.
- **Subjectivity in [Valuation](../v/valuation.md):** Determining what constitutes a "reasonable" price can vary among investors, leading to potential subjectivity and inconsistent results.
- **Potential for Underperformance:** In a growth-oriented [bull market](../b/bull_market.md), GARP strategies might [underperform](../u/underperform.md) pure growth strategies as they include [valuation](../v/valuation.md) constraints.

### GARP vs. Other Investment Strategies

1. **GARP vs. [Growth Investing](../g/growth_investing.md):**
   - [Growth investing](../g/growth_investing.md) focuses solely on companies expected to grow [earnings](../e/earnings.md) at an above-average rate, often disregarding high valuations.
   - GARP introduces [valuation](../v/valuation.md) metrics, ensuring that the investments are not excessively priced relative to their growth potential.

2. **GARP vs. [Value Investing](../v/value_investing.md):**
   - [Value investing](../v/value_investing.md) targets [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) based on [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md), without necessarily prioritizing growth prospects.
   - GARP merges [value investing](../v/value_investing.md) principles with a focus on companies exhibiting strong and stable growth.

3. **GARP vs. [Dividend](../d/dividend.md) [Investing](../i/investing.md):**
   - [Dividend](../d/dividend.md) [investing](../i/investing.md) targets companies that pay high and consistent dividends, often associated with more mature, lower-growth companies.
   - GARP typically does not prioritize [dividend yield](../d/dividend_yield.md); instead, it focuses on [earnings](../e/earnings.md) and [revenue](../r/revenue.md) growth combined with reasonable valuations.

### Famous GARP Investors

- **Peter Lynch:** Perhaps the most famous GARP [investor](../i/investor.md), Peter Lynch managed the Fidelity Magellan [Fund](../f/fund.md) from 1977 to 1990 and achieved an average [annual return](../a/annual_return.md) of 29.2%. He famously looked for "tenbaggers," [stocks](../s/stock.md) that would go up tenfold, while still trading at reasonable valuations. Lynch also popularized the PEG ratio.

### GARP Screening Criteria

To identify potential GARP investment opportunities, investors can use the following screening criteria:
1. **EPS Growth:** Companies with historical and projected EPS [growth rates](../g/growth_rates_in_trading.md) of 10%-20%.
2. **P/E Ratio:** [Stocks](../s/stock.md) with P/E ratios lower than the overall [market](../m/market.md) or below the [earnings](../e/earnings.md) growth rate.
3. **PEG Ratio:** Targets a PEG ratio below 1.
4. **ROE:** Preference for companies with ROE above 15%.
5. **[Debt](../d/debt.md)-to-[Equity](../e/equity.md) Ratio:** Typically, a [debt](../d/debt.md)-to-[equity](../e/equity.md) ratio of less than 50%.

### Real-World Application of GARP

**Case Study: Apple Inc. (AAPL)**
- In the early 2000s, Apple was a classic GARP stock. Despite strong growth prospects with innovative products like the iPod and later the iPhone, Apple's [valuation](../v/valuation.md) remained reasonable for a long time.
- **Growth Metrics:** Apple exhibited substantial EPS and [revenue](../r/revenue.md) growth due to its product innovations and expanding [market share](../m/market_share.md).
- **[Valuation](../v/valuation.md) Metrics:** Despite the growth, Apple's P/E ratio was relatively modest compared to high-flying tech [stocks](../s/stock.md) at that time. The PEG ratio remained attractive, indicating a balance between growth and [value](../v/value.md).
- **Performance:** Investors who recognized Apple as a GARP candidate experienced substantial [capital](../c/capital.md) appreciation as the company continued to innovate and expand its [market](../m/market.md) presence.

### Key Takeaways for GARP Investors

1. **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md):** While the GARP strategy narrows the investment universe, it's crucial to diversify across different sectors to mitigate sector-specific risks.
2. **Continuous Monitoring:** GARP investors must continuously monitor their investments to ensure that companies maintain their growth trajectories and valuations remain reasonable.
3. **Long-term Focus:** GARP typically requires a long-term [investment horizon](../i/investment_horizon.md), as the strategy relies on compound growth over time.

### Conclusion

The Growth at a Reasonable Price (GARP) strategy offers a balanced approach that combines the best aspects of [growth and value investing](../g/growth_and_value_investing.md). By focusing on companies with strong growth potential that are still reasonably valued, GARP provides a framework for potentially high returns while managing investment [risk](../r/risk.md). Investors who apply GARP principles rigorously can identify promising investment opportunities and achieve sustainable long-term growth.

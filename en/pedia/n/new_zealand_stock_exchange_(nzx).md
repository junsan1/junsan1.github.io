# New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZX)

The New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZX) is the premier securities market in New Zealand, offering a platform for listing and trading a wide range of financial instruments, including equities, debt securities, funds, and derivatives. As a primary exchange, NZX plays a critical role in the New Zealand economy by providing capital market infrastructure, facilitating corporate financing, and ensuring a transparent and fair trading environment.

## Background and History

The NZX traces its origins back to the Gold Rush era of the 1860s, when informal stock markets began emerging in New Zealand’s major cities. Initially, it operated as a series of regional exchanges, but these were amalgamated into a single national exchange in 1974. The modern entity, NZX Limited, was formally established in December 2002 under the New Zealand Stock Exchange Restructuring Act. This act transitioned the organization from a mutual association to a for-profit company.

# Nepalese Rupee (NPR)

The Nepalese Rupee (NPR) is the official [currency](../c/currency.md) of Nepal. It is abbreviated as "NPR" and is often symbolized as "रु" or "Rs." The [currency](../c/currency.md) is administered and circulated by the central monetary authority of Nepal, which is the Nepal Rastra [Bank](../b/bank.md) (NRB). 

## Historical Context

The Nepalese Rupee was first introduced in 1932, replacing the earlier [currency](../c/currency.md), the Nepalese Mohar, at a rate of 2 Mohars to 1 Rupee. Initially, the NPR was pegged to the Indian Rupee (INR) and remains closely linked to it today. Historically, India's influence on Nepal's [economy](../e/economy.md) has been substantial, and this connection is evident in the linkage between the currencies of the two countries.

## Coinage and Banknotes

### Coins

The Nepalese Rupee is sub-divided into smaller units called paisa, with 1 rupee equating to 100 paisa. Coins in circulation are available in denominations of 1, 2, 5, and 10 rupees. Historically, smaller units such as 5, 10, 25, and 50 paisa coins were also in use but have been gradually phased out due to [inflation](../i/inflation.md) and the reduced [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) of these small denominations.

### Banknotes

Banknotes are available in various denominations, including Rs. 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, and 1000. Nepal Rastra [Bank](../b/bank.md) governs the issuance and integrity of these notes. They typically feature prominent national symbols, historical figures, and cultural landmarks. For example, the 1000-rupee [note](../n/note.md) prominently features the image of Mount Everest, while the 500-rupee [note](../n/note.md) often features the image of Mount Manaslu. 

## Exchange Rate and Pegging

The [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) of the NPR has been historically pegged to the Indian Rupee. As of now, the [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) is set at 1 NPR ≈ 0.625 INR. This [pegging](../p/pegging.md) helps stabilize the NPR against some of the external economic shocks but can also lead to inflationary pressures depending on the [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md) in India.

In the [foreign exchange](../f/foreign_exchange.md) [market](../m/market.md), the [value](../v/value.md) of the NPR is determined based on its relationship with other major world currencies like the U.S. dollar (USD), the [Euro](../e/euro.md) (EUR), and others. Fluctuations in the [value](../v/value.md) of NPR against these currencies can have significant implications for Nepal's [economy](../e/economy.md), particularly given its reliance on imports and foreign remittances.

## Role in the Nepalese Economy

The Nepalese Rupee serves several critical functions within the Nepalese [economy](../e/economy.md):

- **[Medium of Exchange](../m/medium_of_exchange.md):** The NPR is widely used for all kinds of transactions within Nepal, from everyday purchases to large-scale [business](../b/business.md) deals.
- **[Store of Value](../s/store_of_value.md):** The NPR serves as a repository of [wealth](../w/wealth.md) for individuals and corporate entities.
- **Unit of Account:** Prices, wages, and salaries in Nepal are denoted in NPR, making it a critical unit for economic calculation.
- **Means of [Payment](../p/payment.md):** The NPR is also an essential means of settling debts and financial [obligations](../o/obligation.md) within the country.

## Monetary Policy

[Monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) in Nepal is primarily the responsibility of the Nepal Rastra [Bank](../b/bank.md), which aims to control [inflation](../i/inflation.md), influence [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, and ensure the stability of the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md). The NRB employs various tools such as [open market operations](../o/open_market_operations.md), repo rates, and cash [reserve ratio](../r/reserve_ratio.md) (CRR) to achieve its monetary objectives. 

In recent years, one of the key challenges for the NRB has been to balance [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) with [inflation](../i/inflation.md) control. Nepal's [economy](../e/economy.md), heavily reliant on agriculture and remittances, is particularly sensitive to climatic conditions and global economic trends.

## Impact of Remittances

Remittances form a significant part of Nepal's GDP, contributing close to 30%. A majority of the remittances are received in foreign currencies like USD or Gulf currencies, which are then converted into NPR. This influx of foreign [currency](../c/currency.md) helps to stabilize the [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) and also provides much-needed [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) to the Nepalese [economy](../e/economy.md). 

However, this also means that the NPR can be highly sensitive to fluctuations in the global [job market](../j/job_market.md), particularly in countries where many Nepalese migrant workers are employed.

## Technological Advancements: Digital NPR

With the advent of technology and the shift towards digital transactions, there has been a growing [interest](../i/interest.md) in digitalizing various aspects of the Nepalese [economy](../e/economy.md), including its [currency](../c/currency.md). The possibility of introducing a digital version of the NPR has been a topic of discussion among financial experts and policymakers.

### Mobile Banking and Payment Systems

The rise of [mobile banking](../m/mobile_banking.md) and digital [payment](../p/payment.md) systems in Nepal has been significant. Services like eSewa, Khalti, and IME Pay have revolutionized the way financial transactions are carried out in the country. These platforms allow users to pay bills, transfer [money](../m/money.md), and make purchases using digital NPR, bringing greater convenience and [financial inclusion](../f/financial_inclusion.md) to the broader population.

### Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies

Though [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology and cryptocurrencies are still in their nascent stages in Nepal, there is a growing [interest](../i/interest.md) in these technologies. The NRB has been cautiously exploring the potential for [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) to streamline financial transactions and enhance [security](../s/security.md). However, cryptocurrencies like [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) and [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) are currently not legally recognized or regulated by the NRB.

## Challenges Facing the NPR

Despite its significant role, the Nepalese Rupee faces several challenges:

- **[Inflation](../i/inflation.md):** Controlling [inflation](../i/inflation.md) is a perpetual challenge for the NRB. [Inflation](../i/inflation.md) erodes the [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) of the NPR and can lead to economic instability.
- **[Currency](../c/currency.md) [Pegging](../p/pegging.md):** The peg to the Indian Rupee, while stabilizing to some extent, can also limit Nepal’s [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) autonomy. Economic fluctuations in India can have direct repercussions on Nepal’s [economy](../e/economy.md).
- **[Foreign Exchange Reserves](../f/foreign_exchange_reserves.md):** Maintaining adequate [foreign exchange reserves](../f/foreign_exchange_reserves.md) is crucial for stabilizing the NPR. The NRB often finds it challenging to balance this with other economic priorities.
- **Dependence on Remittances:** Heavy dependence on remittances subjects the NPR to fluctuations based on global [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md), particularly in labor-exporting countries.

## Future Outlook

The future of the Nepalese Rupee [will](../w/will.md) be shaped by several factors, including technological adoption, policy reforms, and external [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md). Strategies to enhance [financial inclusion](../f/financial_inclusion.md), adopt digital currencies, and diversify the [economy](../e/economy.md) [will](../w/will.md) be crucial in ensuring the robustness and stability of the NPR.

In conclusion, the Nepalese Rupee is not just a [medium of exchange](../m/medium_of_exchange.md) but a vital cog in the wheel of Nepal's [economy](../e/economy.md). Its stability, [value](../v/value.md), and evolution [will](../w/will.md) continue to shape the country's economic landscape for years to come.

# Nominated Advisor (NOMAD)

A Nominated Advisor, commonly referred to as a NOMAD, plays a pivotal role in the landscape of financial markets, particularly within the AIM (Alternative Investment Market) of the London Stock Exchange (LSE). The NOMAD is responsible for guiding companies through the intricacies of becoming and remaining publicly listed on AIM. This role is crucial for ensuring market integrity, investor confidence, and the seamless operation of the market for smaller, growing companies.

## Introduction to Nominated Advisors

A NOMAD is an advisory firm approved by the LSE to guide firms through the process of admission to AIM and to ensure they comply with ongoing regulatory requirements. The NOMAD system was introduced to support small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in accessing public capital markets with relatively reduced regulatory burdens compared to larger exchanges.

# Nominated Advisor (NOMAD)

A Nominated Advisor, commonly referred to as a NOMAD, plays a pivotal role in the landscape of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), particularly within the AIM ([Alternative Investment](../a/alternative_investment.md) [Market](../m/market.md)) of the London Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (LSE). The NOMAD is responsible for guiding companies through the intricacies of becoming and remaining publicly [listed](../l/listed.md) on AIM. This role is crucial for ensuring [market](../m/market.md) integrity, [investor](../i/investor.md) confidence, and the seamless operation of the [market](../m/market.md) for smaller, growing companies. Below is a comprehensive analysis of the different facets of a NOMAD's role, responsibilities, regulatory framework, and its overall impact on the financial ecosystem.

## Introduction to Nominated Advisors

A NOMAD is an advisory [firm](../f/firm.md) approved by the LSE to guide firms through the process of admission to AIM and to ensure they comply with ongoing regulatory requirements. The NOMAD system was introduced to support small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in accessing public [capital markets](../c/capital_markets.md) with relatively reduced regulatory burdens compared to larger exchanges.

### Key Functions of a NOMAD

2. **[Due Diligence](../d/due_diligence.md)**: Conducts detailed [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md) on the company to assess its suitability for the public listing.
3. **Ongoing Compliance**: Ensures the [listed](../l/listed.md) company adheres to AIM rules on a continuous [basis](../b/basis.md).
4. **[Corporate Governance](../c/corporate_governance.md)**: Advises on the [best practices](../b/best_practices.md) for [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) and [investor relations](../i/investor_relations.md).

## The Admission Document

One of the critical tasks of a NOMAD is assisting in the preparation of the Admission Document, which serves as the [prospectus](../p/prospectus.md) for the company seeking to list on AIM. This document typically includes:

## Importance of Due Diligence

The [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md) process is arguably one of the most critical aspects of the NOMAD's role. This rigorous process ensures that the company is adequately prepared for the scrutiny of the public markets, and it covers various aspects such as:

- Promote sustainable [business](../b/business.md) practices.

## NOMADs and Financial Technology (FinTech)

With the rise of FinTech companies seeking to list on AIM, NOMADs have had to adapt to the specific needs and challenges associated with this rapidly evolving sector. This includes:

- Providing specialized advice on regulatory compliance for digital assets and [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technologies.

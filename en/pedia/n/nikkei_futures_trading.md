# Nikkei Futures Trading

[Nikkei](../n/nikkei.md) [futures](../f/futures.md) trading is an essential segment of the global financial [market](../m/market.md), specifically aimed at traders who have an [interest](../i/interest.md) in Japan's [economy](../e/economy.md) and its main stock [market index](../m/market_index.md), the [Nikkei](../n/nikkei.md) 225. This guide aims to provide an in-depth understanding of [Nikkei](../n/nikkei.md) [futures](../f/futures.md), including their definition, the mechanisms of trading, strategies, risks, benefits, and the key players in this arena.

## What are Nikkei Futures?

[Nikkei](../n/nikkei.md) [futures](../f/futures.md) are financial contracts that obligate the buyer to purchase, or the seller to sell, the [Nikkei](../n/nikkei.md) 225 [index](../i/index.md) at a predetermined future date and price. The [Nikkei](../n/nikkei.md) 225, often referred to simply as the [Nikkei](../n/nikkei.md), is Japan's premier stock [market index](../m/market_index.md). It comprises 225 large, publicly traded companies [listed](../l/listed.md) on the Tokyo Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md), spanning various sectors from technology to [finance](../f/finance.md) and retail.

The primary reason for trading [futures](../f/futures.md) is to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against [risk](../r/risk.md) or to speculate on the future direction of the [market](../m/market.md).

## Types of Nikkei Futures

1. **[Nikkei](../n/nikkei.md) 225 [Futures](../f/futures.md) on Osaka [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (OSE)**: 
    These are the most popular and widely traded [Nikkei](../n/nikkei.md) [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md). They are Yen-denominated and provide significant [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) for traders.
    
    - **Mini-[Nikkei](../n/nikkei.md) 225 [Futures](../f/futures.md)**: These are smaller contracts often used by retail traders. Each contract represents one-tenth the size of the standard [Nikkei](../n/nikkei.md) 225 [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md), making it more accessible.
   
2. **[Nikkei](../n/nikkei.md) 225 [Futures](../f/futures.md) on CME**: 
    The Chicago Mercantile [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (CME) also lists [Nikkei](../n/nikkei.md) 225 [futures](../f/futures.md). These contracts are similar to those traded on OSE but are denominated in U.S. dollars, catering to international investors.

## How Nikkei Futures Work

Each [Nikkei](../n/nikkei.md) [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) specifies:
- **Contract Size**: The amount of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) covered by the contract.
- **[Expiration Date](../e/expiration_date.md)**: The date when the contract must be settled. [Nikkei](../n/nikkei.md) [futures](../f/futures.md) typically expire quarterly (March, June, September, and December).
- **[Tick Size](../t/tick_size.md)**: The minimum price movement of the contract. For example, the [tick size](../t/tick_size.md) for the standard [Nikkei](../n/nikkei.md) 225 [futures](../f/futures.md) is 5 points.

### Steps in Trading Nikkei Futures

1. **Opening an Account**: [Open](../o/open.md) a [futures](../f/futures.md) [trading account](../t/trading_account.md) with a [broker](../b/broker.md) that offers access to either the Osaka [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) or the Chicago Mercantile [Exchange](../e/exchange.md).
2. **Placing Orders**: Buy or sell the [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) through the [trading platform](../t/trading_platform.md) provided by the [broker](../b/broker.md). 
3. **[Initial Margin](../i/initial_margin.md)**: [Deposit](../d/deposit.md) an [initial margin](../i/initial_margin.md), a fraction of the contract [value](../v/value.md), with the [broker](../b/broker.md) as [collateral](../c/collateral.md).
4. **Mark-to-[Market](../m/market.md)**: [Futures](../f/futures.md) accounts are adjusted daily to reflect [market](../m/market.md) movements. If the position incurs losses, additional [margin](../m/margin.md) must be deposited.
5. **Expiration and Settlement**: On specifying the date, the [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) must be settled. Settlement is typically done through cash rather than [physical delivery](../p/physical_delivery_in_trading.md) of [shares](../s/shares.md).

## Trading Strategies

1. **Hedging**: Corporations and institutional investors use [Nikkei](../n/nikkei.md) [futures](../f/futures.md) to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) their portfolios against potential declines in the Japanese [stock market](../s/stock_market.md).
   
2. **[Speculation](../s/speculation.md)**: Traders take positions in [Nikkei](../n/nikkei.md) [futures](../f/futures.md) to [profit](../p/profit.md) from expected price movements in the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [index](../i/index.md). This can be based on [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md), fundamental research, or a combination of both.
    
3. **[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**: Traders may exploit price discrepancies between the [Nikkei](../n/nikkei.md) [futures](../f/futures.md) on different exchanges or between [futures](../f/futures.md) and the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) cash [market](../m/market.md).

4. **[Spread Trading](../s/spread_trading.md)**: This involves the simultaneous purchase and [sale](../s/sale.md) of two related [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md), aiming to [profit](../p/profit.md) from the change in the price difference.

## Risk Management

Trading [futures](../f/futures.md) involves the following risks:
- **[Market Risk](../m/market_risk.md)**: The primary [risk](../r/risk.md) of [futures](../f/futures.md) trading is [market risk](../m/market_risk.md). Significant price movements can lead to substantial gains or losses.
- **[Leverage](../l/leverage.md) [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: [Futures](../f/futures.md) trading employs high [leverage](../l/leverage.md), which can amplify both profits and losses.
- **[Liquidity Risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md)**: Although [Nikkei](../n/nikkei.md) [futures](../f/futures.md) are generally [liquid](../l/liquid.md), [market](../m/market.md) conditions can change, leading to difficulty in entering or exiting positions.
- **[Counterparty Risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md)**: The [risk](../r/risk.md) that the [counterparty](../c/counterparty.md) in a [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) may [default](../d/default.md).

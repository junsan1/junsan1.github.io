# Non-Marketable Security

A non-marketable [security](../s/security.md) is a type of investment that cannot be easily sold or exchanged for cash on the [open market](../o/open_market.md). These securities are often issued through private placements rather than public offerings. Non-[marketable securities](../m/marketable_securities.md) are typically utilized by governments, corporations, and some other financial institutions for specific purposes or to comply with regulatory requirements.

## Characteristics of Non-Marketable Securities

### Lack of Liquidity

Non-[marketable securities](../m/marketable_securities.md) are characterized by their lack of [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md). Unlike [marketable securities](../m/marketable_securities.md), which can be quickly sold or traded in secondary markets, non-[marketable securities](../m/marketable_securities.md) do not have a readily available marketplace. This makes them difficult to convert into cash when needed.

### Restricted Transferability

These securities often come with restrictions on their transfer. The holder may not be able to sell or transfer the [security](../s/security.md) without meeting certain conditions or obtaining approval from the [issuer](../i/issuer.md). This restricted transferability adds to their illiquid nature.

### Issuance and Purpose

Non-[marketable securities](../m/marketable_securities.md) are usually issued for specific purposes. For instance, governments may [issue](../i/issue.md) non-marketable treasury securities to [finance](../f/finance.md) specific projects without causing fluctuations in the public [debt](../d/debt.md) [market](../m/market.md). Corporations might [issue](../i/issue.md) these securities as part of employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) or to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) from a select group of investors in a [private placement](../p/private_placement.md).

## Types of Non-Marketable Securities

### Government Non-Marketable Securities

Governments often [issue](../i/issue.md) non-[marketable securities](../m/marketable_securities.md) to [finance](../f/finance.md) public projects or manage their [debt](../d/debt.md) profile more efficiently. These include:

#### U.S. Savings Bonds

These are non-[marketable securities](../m/marketable_securities.md) issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. They are designed to be held to [maturity](../m/maturity.md) and cannot be easily sold on secondary markets. Examples include Series EE and Series I savings bonds, which are popular among investors seeking a low-[risk](../r/risk.md), long-term investment.

#### Government Account Series (GAS)

These are special non-[marketable securities](../m/marketable_securities.md) issued to federal government [trust](../t/trust.md) funds and accounts, such as the [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) [Trust Fund](../t/trust_fund.md). These securities carry special terms and conditions tailored to the needs of government inter-agency transactions.

### Corporate Non-Marketable Securities

Corporations may [issue](../i/issue.md) non-[marketable securities](../m/marketable_securities.md) for various strategic reasons. These can include:

#### Private Placements

In a [private placement](../p/private_placement.md), a company issues securities directly to a selected group of investors rather than through a public [offering](../o/offering.md). These securities are often illiquid due to restrictions on resale and transfer. Investors typically agree to [hold](../h/hold.md) the securities for a prescribed period.

#### Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs)

Companies may [issue](../i/issue.md) non-marketable stock to employees as part of ESOPs. These [shares](../s/shares.md) are not traded on public markets and often come with restrictions on resale and transfer. The purpose is to align the interests of employees with the company’s performance.

### Financial Institution Non-Marketable Securities

Financial institutions, such as banks and [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies, may also [issue](../i/issue.md) non-[marketable securities](../m/marketable_securities.md). These can include:

#### Certificates of Deposit (CDs)

Certain types of CDs, particularly those with long maturities or specific conditions, can be considered non-marketable. While many CDs are freely tradable, some are designed to be held until [maturity](../m/maturity.md) and cannot be easily transferred.

#### Insurance Policies

Some [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policies and annuities are structured as non-[marketable securities](../m/marketable_securities.md). These contracts are individual agreements between the policyholder and the insurer and cannot be sold or transferred without significant restrictions.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

#### Stability

Due to their illiquid nature and restricted transferability, non-[marketable securities](../m/marketable_securities.md) can [offer](../o/offer.md) greater stability and predictability than [marketable securities](../m/marketable_securities.md). For instance, [U.S. savings bonds](../u/u.s._savings_bonds.md) provide stable, long-term returns unaffected by [market](../m/market.md) fluctuations.

#### Targeted Funding

Issuers can use non-[marketable securities](../m/marketable_securities.md) for targeted funding purposes. For example, private placements allow companies to raise funds from specific investors without the regulatory burdens of a public [offering](../o/offering.md).

#### Employee Incentives

Non-[marketable securities](../m/marketable_securities.md) issued as part of ESOPs can help align employee interests with the company’s success, potentially leading to improved performance and loyalty.

### Disadvantages

#### Illiquidity

The primary disadvantage is the lack of [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md). Investors cannot quickly sell these securities in secondary markets, which can pose issues if immediate cash is needed.

#### Limited Market

The restricted transferability means there is often no competitive [market price](../m/market_price.md), which can impede accurate [valuation](../v/valuation.md) and make it difficult to determine the true worth of the [security](../s/security.md).

#### Higher Risk

Investors may face higher risks due to the potential difficulty in reselling the securities or if the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) encounters financial troubles. The lack of marketability can compound these risks.

## Regulatory Considerations

### Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Regulations

Non-[marketable securities](../m/marketable_securities.md) issued in the United States are subject to various regulatory requirements. The SEC mandates conditions for issuing and reporting private placements and other types of non-[marketable securities](../m/marketable_securities.md). Companies must comply with these regulations to ensure [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and protect [investor](../i/investor.md) interests.

### Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)

FINRA also plays a role in setting rules and standards for the issuance and handling of non-[marketable securities](../m/marketable_securities.md) in the U.S. They ensure that brokers and financial advisors comply with [ethical standards](../e/ethical_standards_in_trading.md) when advising clients on such investments.

### Internal Revenue Service (IRS)

The IRS provides specific guidelines on the tax treatment of non-[marketable securities](../m/marketable_securities.md). For instance, [interest](../i/interest.md) earned on [U.S. savings bonds](../u/u.s._savings_bonds.md) may be [tax-deferred](../t/tax_deferred.md) until the [bond](../b/bond.md) is redeemed or matures, providing potential tax benefits to investors.

## Examples of Non-Marketable Securities

### Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) “G” Fund

The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) offered to Federal employees includes a Government Securities [Investment Fund](../i/investment_fund.md) (G [Fund](../f/fund.md)). This [fund](../f/fund.md) consists of unique, non-marketable [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) securities specifically issued to the TSP, providing a stable, although generally lower [return](../r/return.md).

### Corporate Bonds Issued in Private Placements

Corporate bonds issued through private placements [offer](../o/offer.md) examples of non-[marketable securities](../m/marketable_securities.md). These bonds can provide tailored investment opportunities for sophisticated investors but remain illiquid due to transfer restrictions.

## Conclusion

Non-[marketable securities](../m/marketable_securities.md) [hold](../h/hold.md) a significant, but specific, place in the broader financial landscape. While they [offer](../o/offer.md) advantages such as stability and targeted investment opportunities, their lack of [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and restricted transferability can pose challenges and higher risks. Understanding the nature and characteristics of these securities is crucial for both issuers and investors to make informed financial decisions.

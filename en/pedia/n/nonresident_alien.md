# Nonresident Alien

A Nonresident Alien (NRA) refers to an individual who is not a U.S. citizen or a U.S. resident for tax purposes and has specific tax obligations and benefits. The term is predominantly used in the context of U.S. tax law, managed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). This designation has significant implications for individuals concerning their tax responsibilities on income earned within the United States and abroad. It also affects their eligibility for certain tax benefits and obligations related to investments, property, and other financial elements within the United States.

## Definition and Criteria

According to U.S. tax legislation, a nonresident alien is someone who does not pass the Green Card Test or the Substantial Presence Test:

1. **Green Card Test**: This test considers whether an individual has been issued an alien registration card (Green Card) by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). If an individual has a Green Card, they are classified as a U.S. resident for tax purposes.

2. **Substantial Presence Test**: This test considers the number of days an individual has been physically present in the U.S. over a three-year period. It has two components:

   - The individual must be present in the U.S. for at least 31 days during the current tax year.
   - The sum of days present in the current year, one-third of the days present in the previous year, and one-sixth of the days present in the second preceding year must be 183 days or more.

Failing both tests designates an individual as a nonresident alien for that tax year.

## Tax Implications

### Taxation on U.S. Sourced Income

Nonresident aliens are taxed only on their U.S.-sourced income, which can include:

- Wages or salaries earned from working within the U.S.
- Income from a business or trade conducted within the U.S.
- Gains from the sale of U.S. real estate.
- Income from U.S. investments such as interest, dividends, royalties, and pensions.

### Forms and Filings

Nonresident aliens utilize specific IRS forms and schedules that are different from those used by U.S. residents:

- **Form 1040-NR**: U.S. Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return.
- **Form 8233**: Exemption From Withholding on Compensation for Independent (and Certain Dependent) Personal Services of a Nonresident Alien Individual.
- **W-8 Series Forms** (e.g., W-8BEN, W-8ECI): These forms are used to declare foreign taxpayer status and claim tax treaty benefits for reducing or eliminating withholding tax.

### Withholding Tax

Nonresident aliens may be subject to specific withholding tax requirements on various types of income, such as:

- **FDAP Income**: Fixed, Determinable, Annual, or Periodic income (e.g., interest, dividends, rents). This is typically subject to a 30% withholding rate unless reduced by a tax treaty.
- **ETBUS Income**: Effectively Connected Income (related to a U.S.-based trade or business), which is taxed at graduated rates similar to U.S. residents.

### Tax Treaties

The U.S. has tax treaties with several countries aimed at preventing double taxation and helping nonresidents benefit from reduced tax rates or exemptions. Nonresident aliens must refer to the tax treaty applicable to their home country and may need to file additional forms to claim these benefits.

## Financial Considerations

### Investment Accounts

Nonresident aliens may face restrictions when opening investment accounts in the U.S. Such individuals often need to provide additional documentation and may be subject to unique account policies.

### Property Ownership

Nonresident aliens can purchase and own property in the U.S., but they must observe different tax rules related to rental income, capital gains, and estate taxes. Gains from the sale of U.S.-based property by a nonresident alien are generally subject to tax, and special rules may apply to ensure compliance.

### Estate and Gift Taxes

Nonresident aliens are subject to U.S. federal estate and gift taxes on assets located within the U.S. The thresholds for estate tax exemptions for nonresidents are significantly lower than those for U.S. citizens and residents.

## Legal and Compliance

### Income Reporting

Nonresident aliens must accurately report all U.S.-sourced income on their tax returns. Failure to do so can result in penalties and interest charges.

### FATCA and FBAR

The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) requires foreign financial institutions to report accounts held by U.S. taxpayers, which may indirectly impact nonresident aliens with U.S.-based assets. Additionally, nonresident aliens with certain levels of financial interests in or signature authority over foreign financial accounts must file a Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR).

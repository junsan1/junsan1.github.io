# Neutrality Of Money

Neutrality of [money](../m/money.md) is a concept in [economics](../e/economics.md) and monetary theory which posits that changes in the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) only affect [nominal](../n/nominal.md) variables like prices, wages, and [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates in the [long run](../l/long_run.md), and have no impact on real variables such as real output, employment, and real consumption. This theory is predicated on the idea that [money](../m/money.md) is a veil that does not interfere with the fundamental workings of the [economy](../e/economy.md).

## Historical Background

The idea of the neutrality of [money](../m/money.md) dates back to [classical economics](../c/classical_economics.md) and has been a core principle in monetary theory. Classical economists like David Hume and [John Stuart Mill](../j/john_stuart_mill.md) originally proposed that changes in the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) do not affect real economic activity in the [long run](../l/long_run.md). This concept was influential in guiding [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) and economic thought, influencing the approach taken by central banks and economists globally.

## Key Concepts

### Real vs. Nominal Variables

- **Real Variables**: These include real GDP, employment, consumption, and [capital](../c/capital.md). They are measured in physical units and are adjusted for [inflation](../i/inflation.md).
  
- **[Nominal](../n/nominal.md) Variables**: These include [nominal](../n/nominal.md) GDP, price levels, and [nominal](../n/nominal.md) wages. They are measured in current monetary units and are not adjusted for [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

### Short-run vs Long-run Neutrality

- **Short-run Neutrality**: In the [short run](../s/short_run.md), changes in the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) can affect real variables. For instance, an increase in the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) can stimulate economic activity, reduce [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md), and boost production.

- **Long-run Neutrality**: In the [long run](../l/long_run.md), however, the impact of [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) changes is neutralized. This means that any changes in the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) [will](../w/will.md) lead to proportional changes in price levels and other [nominal](../n/nominal.md) variables, without affecting real variables. The long-run neutrality holds because eventually, prices and wages adjust to the changes in the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md).

### Classical Dichotomy

The neutrality of [money](../m/money.md) is closely related to the classical dichotomy, which holds that real and [nominal](../n/nominal.md) variables can be analyzed separately. According to this dichotomy, the real side of the [economy](../e/economy.md) (determined by factors like technology and preferences) is independent of the [nominal](../n/nominal.md) side (determined by the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md)).

### Quantity Theory of Money

One of the foundational models supporting the neutrality of [money](../m/money.md) is the [Quantity Theory of Money](../q/quantity_theory_of_money.md), famously encapsulated in the equation:

\[ MV = PY \]

where:
- \( M \) = [Money supply](../m/money_supply.md)
- \( V \) = [Velocity of money](../v/velocity_of_money.md) (rate at which [money](../m/money.md) circulates in the [economy](../e/economy.md))
- \( P \) = [Price level](../p/price_level.md)
- \( Y \) = Real output (real GDP)

The theory posits that if the [velocity of money](../v/velocity_of_money.md) is constant and output is determined by real factors, any change in the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) \( M \) [will](../w/will.md) result in a proportional change in the [price level](../p/price_level.md) \( P \).

## Empirical Evidence

While the theoretical neutrality of [money](../m/money.md) holds strong appeal, empirical evidence provides a more nuanced picture:

### Supporting Evidence

- **[Hyperinflation](../h/hyperinflation.md) Scenarios**: Historical instances of [hyperinflation](../h/hyperinflation.md), such as in Zimbabwe in the late 2000s, show that massive increases in the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) can lead to proportional increases in price levels without boosting real variables like output.
  
- **Long-term Data**: Empirical studies over extended periods often support the premise that while [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) changes can affect real economic activity in the [short run](../s/short_run.md), the long-run effects are largely on [nominal](../n/nominal.md) variables.

### Challenging Evidence

- **Sticky Prices and Wages**: Some empirical evidence suggests that prices and wages do not adjust instantaneously to changes in the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md). In these models, short-term price and wage rigidity can result in prolonged impacts on real variables.
  
- **New Keynesian Models**: Recent economic models argue that even in the [long run](../l/long_run.md), [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) can have real effects under certain conditions. These models incorporate elements such as [monopolistic competition](../m/monopolistic_competition.md) and [price stickiness](../p/price_stickiness.md), challenging the strict neutrality of [money](../m/money.md).

## Implications for Policy

The neutrality of [money](../m/money.md) influences both [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) and economic thought. Central banks often design their policies based on the understanding of [money](../m/money.md)â€™s long-run neutrality and short-run non-neutrality.

### Central Banking Policies

- **[Inflation](../i/inflation.md) Targeting**: Understanding that [money](../m/money.md) impacts price levels, central banks may target a specific [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rate, adjusting the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) to achieve stable prices.
  
- **[Interest Rate](../i/interest_rate.md) Policies**: By adjusting [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, central banks can influence the short-run real [economy](../e/economy.md). For example, lowering [interest](../i/interest.md) rates can spur investment and consumption, even if these effects are neutralized in the [long run](../l/long_run.md).

### Fiscal Policy

Governments, understanding the neutrality of [money](../m/money.md), might lean more towards fiscal policies for long-term [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) rather than relying solely on [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md).

## Criticisms and Limitations

While the neutrality of [money](../m/money.md) is a foundational concept, it is not without criticisms:

- **Real-world Frictions**: Economies have numerous frictions such as [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md), informational asymmetries, and policy lags that can weaken the neutrality assumption.
  
- **Simplistic View**: Critics argue that the neutrality of [money](../m/money.md) is a simplistic view that does not fully capture the complexities of modern economies.

- **Policy Ineffectiveness Proposition**: In the context of rational expectations, some theorists argue that anticipated [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) [will](../w/will.md) be [neutral](../n/neutral.md), but unanticipated policy can affect real variables.

## Conclusion

The neutrality of [money](../m/money.md) remains a pivotal concept in [economics](../e/economics.md), bridging classical theory and modern analysis. Its implications are vast, influencing how policymakers frame economic strategies and how economists model the interactions between [nominal](../n/nominal.md) and real variables. By examining both supportive and challenging evidence, as well as the theory's limitations, one gains a comprehensive understanding of its role in monetary theory and policy.

# Near the Money

In the world of [finance](../f/finance.md) and trading, the term "Near the [Money](../m/money.md)" (NTM) is used primarily in the context of [options](../o/options.md) trading. Understanding this concept is crucial for traders who are involved in [options](../o/options.md) contracts, as it directly influences strategies and decision-making processes regarding potential profits and risks associated with these financial instruments.

## Definition and Explanation

"Near the [Money](../m/money.md)" refers to an option whose [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) is very close to the current trading price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). This term can be applied to both call and [put options](../p/put_options.md):

- **[Call Option](../c/call_option.md):** Gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).
- **[Put Option](../p/put.md):** Gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).

For an option to be considered "Near the [Money](../m/money.md)," its [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) should be as close as possible to the current [market price](../m/market_price.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), yet not exactly the same (which would be "[At the Money](../a/at_the_money.md)").

### Near the Money vs At the Money vs Out of the Money

To paint a clearer picture:
- **[At the Money](../a/at_the_money.md) (ATM):** The option's [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) is exactly equal to the current price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).
- **In the [Money](../m/money.md) (ITM):** For call [options](../o/options.md), [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) < current price; for [put options](../p/put_options.md), [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) > current price.
- **Out of the [Money](../m/money.md) (OTM):** For call [options](../o/options.md), [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) > current price; for [put options](../p/put_options.md), [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) < current price.

"Near the [Money](../m/money.md)" serves as an intermediary stage where the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) is neither close enough to be "[At the Money](../a/at_the_money.md)" nor sufficiently advantaged in the case of "In the [Money](../m/money.md)" [options](../o/options.md).

## Practical Use in Trading Strategies

### Straddles and Strangles

**Straddles**
- When a [trader](../t/trader.md) buys a call and [put option](../p/put.md) with the same [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) and [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md).
- Ideal when expecting significant [volatility](../v/volatility.md) but uncertain of the price direction.
- For a successful strategy, the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)’s price needs to deviate sufficiently from the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) to cover the cost of both [options](../o/options.md).

**Strangles**
- A variation that involves purchasing a call and [put option](../p/put.md) with different strike prices but the same expiration.
- Commonly, the [options](../o/options.md) are near the [money](../m/money.md), but with slightly different strikes to reduce the cost of the [trade](../t/trade.md).
- Offers a similar strategy to straddles but can be more cost-effective.

### Hedging

[Options](../o/options.md) Near the [Money](../m/money.md) are also instrumental in hedging existing positions. Traders might use NTM [options](../o/options.md) to protect against small adverse price movements while keeping premiums relatively low. For example, an [equity](../e/equity.md) [portfolio manager](../p/portfolio_manager.md) could buy NTM [put options](../p/put_options.md) to insure against minor downturns in stock prices without inflating hedging costs excessively.

### Bull and Bear Spreads

**[Bull](../b/bull.md) [Spreads](../s/spreads.md)**
- Created with calls ([Bull Call Spread](../b/bull_call_spread.md)) or puts ([Bull Put Spread](../b/bull_put_spread.md)).
- Investors buy NTM [options](../o/options.md) and sell OTM [options](../o/options.md).
- This strategy is employed when a moderate rise in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price is expected.

**Bear [Spreads](../s/spreads.md)**
- Created with calls ([Bear Call Spread](../b/bear_call_spread.md)) or puts ([Bear Put Spread](../b/bear_put_spread.md)).
- Investors sell NTM [options](../o/options.md) and buy OTM or further NTM [options](../o/options.md).
- This strategy is employed when a moderate decline in the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) is expected.

## Key Considerations

### Implied Volatility and Greeks

Near the [Money](../m/money.md) [options](../o/options.md) are particularly sensitive to changes in implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md). Since NTM [options](../o/options.md) are close to becoming either ITM or OTM based on small price movements, they possess higher "[vega](../v/vega.md)," denoting sensitivity to [volatility](../v/volatility.md) changes. Additionally, [Greeks](../g/greeks.md) like [delta](../d/delta.md) and [theta](../t/theta.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) significant insights:
- **[Delta](../d/delta.md):** Measures the change in the option's price relative to a change in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)’s price. NTM [options](../o/options.md) typically have deltas close to 0.5, meaning they capture half of the price movement.
- **[Theta](../t/theta.md):** Indicates the rate of [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) in the option's [value](../v/value.md). NTM [options](../o/options.md) can lose [value](../v/value.md) quickly as expiration approaches, emphasizing the importance of timing in trading.

### Time Decay

Given their placement on the price spectrum, NTM [options](../o/options.md) experience notable [time decay](../t/time_decay.md). As the [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md) approaches without significant price movement in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), the [value](../v/value.md) of these [options](../o/options.md) erodes rapidly. Traders must be diligent in managing positions and deciding optimal entry and exit points to mitigate adverse effects of [time decay](../t/time_decay.md).

### Liquidity

NTM [options](../o/options.md) usually exhibit high trading volumes and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md). This makes them attractive for traders who require the flexibility to execute trades quickly and at favorable prices. [Market](../m/market.md) makers and institutional investors often focus on NTM [options](../o/options.md) due to their strategic importance in trading portfolios.

## Examples in Practice

### Apple Inc. (AAPL)

Consider Apple Inc. (AAPL) trading at $150 per share. If an [investor](../i/investor.md) buys a [call option](../c/call_option.md) with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $149 and [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md) in one month, this option would be considered Near the [Money](../m/money.md). The decision to enter this position might be driven by an expectation of minor, positive price movements in AAPL stock, with potential gains if the stock price surpasses $149 plus the [option premium](../o/option_premium.md) by expiration.

### Tesla Inc. (TSLA)

Suppose Tesla Inc. (TSLA) is trading at $700 per share. An [investor](../i/investor.md) might create a [strangle](../s/strangle.md) by buying a [call option](../c/call_option.md) with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $720 and a [put option](../p/put.md) with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $680, both expiring in three months. If Tesla’s price moves significantly in either direction due to an [earnings announcement](../e/earnings_announcement.md) or product launch, the payoff from the [strangle](../s/strangle.md) can [offset](../o/offset.md) the combined premiums and generate [profit](../p/profit.md).

## Conclusion

Understanding and utilizing "Near the [Money](../m/money.md)" [options](../o/options.md) is a pivotal skill in the toolkit of modern traders. These [options](../o/options.md) present a balance between [risk](../r/risk.md) and reward, integrating effectively into diverse [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) ranging from speculative plays, hedging purposes, to [spread trading](../s/spread_trading.md). Mastery of this concept demands a solid grasp of [underlying](../u/underlying.md) price movements, [volatility](../v/volatility.md), and the impact of [time decay](../t/time_decay.md). Additionally, leveraging NTM [options](../o/options.md) mandates a strategic approach towards [asset management](../a/asset_management.md), aligning [trade](../t/trade.md) executions with [market](../m/market.md) conditions and individual [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) levels.

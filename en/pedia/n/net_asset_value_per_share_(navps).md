# Net Asset Value Per Share (NAVPS)

## Introduction
Net [Asset](../a/asset.md) [Value](../v/value.md) Per Share (NAVPS) is a financial metric used to quantify the per-share [value](../v/value.md) of an [investment fund](../i/investment_fund.md)'s assets minus its liabilities. This measure is especially crucial in the context of mutual funds, [exchange](../e/exchange.md)-traded funds (ETFs), and closed-end funds. NAVPS represents the [value](../v/value.md) of a single share in a [fund](../f/fund.md) and is critical for both shareholders and prospective investors to assess the [value](../v/value.md) and performance of their investments.

## Calculation of NAVPS

### Formula
The formula to compute NAVPS is straightforward:

\[ \text{NAVPS} = \frac{\text{Total Net Assets}}{\text{Total Number of [Shares](../s/shares.md) Outstanding}} \]

Here, "Total Net Assets" is the difference between the total assets and liabilities of the [fund](../f/fund.md). 

### Steps
1. **Total Assets**: Calculate the total [market value](../m/market_value.md) of all the assets held by the [fund](../f/fund.md).
2. **[Total Liabilities](../t/total_liabilities.md)**: Sum up all the liabilities or [obligations](../o/obligation.md) the [fund](../f/fund.md) owes.
3. **Net Assets**: Subtract the [total liabilities](../t/total_liabilities.md) from the total assets.
4. **[Shares](../s/shares.md) Outstanding**: Determine the total number of [shares](../s/shares.md) that are currently held by all shareholders.
5. **Division**: Divide the net assets by the total number of [shares](../s/shares.md) outstanding to get the NAVPS.

### Example
Assume a [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md) has:
- Total Assets: $100 million
- [Total Liabilities](../t/total_liabilities.md): $10 million
- [Shares](../s/shares.md) Outstanding: 1 million

\[ \text{NAVPS} = \frac{100,000,000 - 10,000,000}{1,000,000} = \frac{90,000,000}{1,000,000} = 90 \]

Thus, the NAVPS of this [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md) would be $90.

## Importance of NAVPS

### Investment Decision Making
NAVPS plays a pivotal role in investment decision making. Investors look at NAVPS to determine whether to buy, [hold](../h/hold.md), or sell a [fund](../f/fund.md). A higher NAVPS indicates a higher per-share [value](../v/value.md) of the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s net assets, which can be an [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of good performance. However, it's wise to consider other metrics and not rely solely on NAVPS.

### Fund Performance Assessment
NAVPS helps in measuring the performance of a [fund](../f/fund.md) over time. Comparing NAVPS from different time periods allows investors to gauge whether the [fund](../f/fund.md) is growing or shrinking.

### Pricing Mechanism
For mutual funds and ETFs, NAVPS is integral to the pricing mechanism. Mutual funds typically price their [shares](../s/shares.md) based on the NAVPS calculated at the end of the trading day. ETFs, although traded on exchanges like [stocks](../s/stock.md), also derive their [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) from the NAVPS calculated regularly throughout the trading day.

### Benchmarking
NAVPS is often used in benchmarking. Funds can be compared against each other using NAVPS to determine which [fund](../f/fund.md) is managed more effectively or delivers better [value](../v/value.md) to investors.

## NAVPS in Different Fund Types

### Mutual Funds
In mutual funds, NAVPS is calculated daily at the end of the trading day. It reflects the [market value](../m/market_value.md) of the securities held in the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s portfolio after [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for daily changes.

### Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)
ETFs also utilize NAVPS, but they [trade](../t/trade.md) on stock exchanges at [market](../m/market.md) prices that can differ from their NAVPS. The NAVPS for ETFs is updated regularly throughout the trading day to help investors make informed decisions.

### Closed-End Funds
Closed-end funds [issue](../i/issue.md) a fixed number of [shares](../s/shares.md) and [trade](../t/trade.md) on exchanges. NAVPS is still a critical metric for these funds, but the [market price](../m/market_price.md) can fluctuate significantly above or below the NAVPS based on [supply](../s/supply.md) and [demand](../d/demand.md).

## Factors Affecting NAVPS

### Market Value of Assets
If the [market value](../m/market_value.md) of the assets held by the [fund](../f/fund.md) increases, the NAVPS [will](../w/will.md) rise. Conversely, if the [market value](../m/market_value.md) declines, NAVPS [will](../w/will.md) decrease.

### Liabilities
An increase in the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s liabilities [will](../w/will.md) lead to a decrease in NAVPS. This includes management fees, administrative costs, and any other [obligations](../o/obligation.md).

### Dividend Distributions
When a [fund](../f/fund.md) distributes dividends to its shareholders, the NAVPS [will](../w/will.md) typically decrease by the amount of the [distribution](../d/distribution.md). This is because part of the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s assets is being distributed, thus reducing the total net assets.

### Share Issuance or Redemption
The issuance of new [shares](../s/shares.md) or [redemption](../r/redemption.md) of existing [shares](../s/shares.md) can impact the NAVPS. Issuing new [shares](../s/shares.md) can dilute the NAVPS if the new [shares](../s/shares.md) are sold at a price below the current NAVPS. Conversely, redeeming [shares](../s/shares.md) can increase NAVPS if done at a price above the current NAVPS.

## Limitations of NAVPS

### Market Price Discrepancy
For funds traded on stock exchanges, such as ETFs and closed-end funds, there can be a significant discrepancy between the NAVPS and the [market price](../m/market_price.md) of the [shares](../s/shares.md). This can be due to [market](../m/market.md) [demand](../d/demand.md), [investor](../i/investor.md) sentiment, and other factors.

### Not Reflective of Future Performance
NAVPS is a historical measure and does not necessarily reflect the future performance of the [fund](../f/fund.md). Investors should consider other metrics and forward-looking indicators in their decision-making process.

### Management Efficiency
A high NAVPS does not always indicate efficient management. It's crucial to look at the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s performance relative to its [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) and other funds in the same category.

## Conclusion
Net [Asset](../a/asset.md) [Value](../v/value.md) Per Share (NAVPS) is a critical metric in the world of mutual funds, ETFs, and closed-end funds. It provides a snapshot of the per-share [value](../v/value.md) of a [fund](../f/fund.md)'s net assets and plays an essential role in investment decision making, [fund](../f/fund.md) performance assessment, and pricing. While NAVPS is an invaluable tool, investors should use it in conjunction with other financial metrics to make well-informed investment decisions.

# Needs Approach

The Needs Approach is a financial strategy primarily used within the [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) [industry](../i/industry.md) to determine the amount of [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) coverage an individual requires. It involves assessing the financial needs that would arise due to the untimely death of an individual, considering factors like [income](../i/income.md) replacement, [debt](../d/debt.md) [repayment](../r/repayment.md), education expenses, and other future financial [obligations](../o/obligation.md). This comprehensive method ensures that dependents are adequately protected by identifying specific financial [gaps](../g/gap.md) that need to be filled.

## What is the Needs Approach?

The Needs Approach is a technique for calculating the proper amount of [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) coverage. It focuses on the financial needs of the beneficiaries and aims to ensure that they can maintain their [standard of living](../s/standard_of_living.md) and meet future financial commitments if the primary [income](../i/income.md) provider passes away unexpectedly. Unlike other methodologies that might use a simple [multiple](../m/multiple.md) of annual [income](../i/income.md), the Needs Approach delves into the specific financial requirements of the family.

## Steps Involved in the Needs Approach

1. **Determine Immediate Needs**: This includes final expenses such as funeral costs, medical bills, and debts that need to be settled immediately after the insured’s death.
   
2. **Calculate Ongoing Needs**: This section involves [income](../i/income.md) replacement to ensure that the surviving family members can maintain their current lifestyle. This part usually covers daily living expenses like rent or [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) payments, utilities, groceries, and transportation.
   
3. **Future Financial Goals**: This focuses on setting aside [money](../m/money.md) for long-term goals, like funding children’s education or retirement for the surviving spouse.

4. **Assets and Other Resources**: Assess existing assets, savings, and other [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policies that can [offset](../o/offset.md) the required [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) amount.

## Components of Financial Needs

### Immediate Needs
- **Final Expenses**: These are expenses that arise immediately upon the death of the insured, such as funeral and burial costs, which can [range](../r/range.md) between $7,000 to $10,000 on average in the United States.
- **Medical Bills**: Any unpaid medical bills from the final illness or accident.

### Ongoing Needs
- **[Income](../i/income.md) Replacement**: This amount primarily depends on the number of years the surviving dependents [will](../w/will.md) need financial support. It's common to calculate this based on a [multiple](../m/multiple.md) of the insured’s annual [income](../i/income.md).
- **Debts**: Mortgages, car loans, or any other personal loans need to be considered so that dependents aren't burdened with these financial [obligations](../o/obligation.md).
  
### Future Financial Goals
- **Education Expenses**: Setting aside an amount for children’s college education can be a significant part of the needs calculation.
- **[Retirement Planning](../r/retirement_planning.md)**: Ensuring that the surviving spouse has enough funds to continue their [retirement planning](../r/retirement_planning.md) without financial stress.
  
### Available Assets
- **Savings and Investments**: Existing [shares](../s/shares.md), mutual funds, bonds, and cash savings.
- **Other [Life Insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) Policies**: Any additional [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policies that might contribute to the beneficiaries' financial needs.

## Calculation Example

Let’s consider a hypothetical example to make this clearer.

**Immediate Needs:**
- Final Expenses: $10,000
- Medical Bills: $5,000
**Total Immediate Needs**: $15,000

**Ongoing Needs:**
- Annual [Income](../i/income.md) Replacement: $50,000 (for 10 years): $500,000
- [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md): $150,000
- Car Loans: $20,000
**Total Ongoing Needs**: $670,000

**Future Financial Goals:**
- Child’s Education [Fund](../f/fund.md): $100,000
- Retirement [Fund](../f/fund.md) for Spouse: $200,000
**Total Future Goals**: $300,000

**Total Needs**: Immediate Needs + Ongoing Needs + Future Financial Goals
**Total Needs**: $15,000 + $670,000 + $300,000 = $985,000

**Available Assets:**
- Savings: $50,000
- Other [Life Insurance](../l/life_insurance.md): $200,000
**Total Available Assets**: $250,000

**[Life Insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) Required**: Total Needs – Total Available Assets
**[Life Insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) Required**: $985,000 - $250,000 = $735,000

Therefore, based on the Needs Approach, the individual would require approximately $735,000 in [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) coverage to ensure that their beneficiaries could meet their immediate, ongoing, and future financial needs.

## Comparison with Other Approaches

The Needs Approach is different from other methodologies such as:

### Multiple of Income Approach
This method is simpler but less precise. It calculates the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) amount as a [multiple](../m/multiple.md) (usually 5-10 times) the insured’s annual [income](../i/income.md). While easy to use, it doesn't consider specific financial [obligations](../o/obligation.md) or assets.

### Human Life Value Approach
This approach calculates the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of the future [earnings](../e/earnings.md) of the insured. This method focuses solely on [income](../i/income.md) replacement and doesn’t take into account specific needs.

### Blended Approach
Some financial planners use a combination of the Needs Approach and other methodologies to ensure a more holistic view of an individual's [insurance](../i/insurance.md) needs.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages
- **Precision**: The Needs Approach provides a more tailored [insurance](../i/insurance.md) coverage amount by considering specific financial [obligations](../o/obligation.md) and assets.
- **Comprehensive**: It covers immediate, ongoing, and future financial needs, ensuring a 360-degree assessment.
- **Customized [Financial Planning](../f/financial_planning.md)**: Allows customization based on individual family needs, goals, and existing resources.

### Disadvantages
- **Complexity**: It is more time-consuming and complicated compared to simpler methods like the [multiple](../m/multiple.md) of [income approach](../i/income_approach.md).
- **Assumption-Dependent**: Highly dependent on the accuracy of future assumptions, such as [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rates, investment returns, and changes in family circumstances.

## Practical Applications

### For Families
Families can use this approach to ensure that they are adequately insured and that dependents [will](../w/will.md) be financially secure in the event of an untimely death of a family member.

### For Financial Advisors
Financial advisors can apply the Needs Approach to provide customized [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) solutions to their clients, ensuring comprehensive [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md).

### For Insurance Companies
[Insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies can use the Needs Approach to develop products that align with the specific financial needs of different [customer](../c/customer.md) segments.

## Conclusion

The Needs Approach is a [robust](../r/robust.md) and comprehensive methodology for determining the appropriate amount of [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) coverage. By focusing on the individual’s specific financial circumstances, this approach ensures a precise alignment of [insurance](../i/insurance.md) coverage with the actual financial needs of the beneficiaries, thus providing better financial [security](../s/security.md) and peace of mind.

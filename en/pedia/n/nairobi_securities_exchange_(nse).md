# Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE)

The Nairobi Securities [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (NSE) is a leading African [exchange](../e/exchange.md), based in Nairobi, Kenya. It plays a crucial role in the development of the Kenyan [capital](../c/capital.md) [market](../m/market.md) by providing a platform for trading of equities, [debt](../d/debt.md) instruments, and other related securities.

## History and Evolution

The NSE was established in 1954 as the Nairobi Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md), becoming a key player in Kenya's financial [market](../m/market.md) [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md).

The transformation into the Nairobi Securities [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) in 2011 marked a significant milestone, symbolizing its expanded role in trading securities beyond traditional [stocks](../s/stock.md).

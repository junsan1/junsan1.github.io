# Negative Goodwill (NGW)

Negative [Goodwill](../g/goodwill.md) (NGW), also known as "bargain purchase," is a term in [accounting](../a/accounting.md) and [finance](../f/finance.md) that arises during the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) of a company. It occurs when the acquiring entity purchases the target company for an amount less than its fair [market value](../m/market_value.md). In other words, the price the acquirer pays is less than the total [assessed value](../a/assessed_value.md) of the acquired company's net assets. Unlike positive [goodwill](../g/goodwill.md), where the acquirer pays a [premium](../p/premium.md) over the fair [market value](../m/market_value.md), negative [goodwill](../g/goodwill.md) indicates a situation where the acquirer gets a "bargain" on the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md).

## Reasons Behind Negative Goodwill

Negative [Goodwill](../g/goodwill.md) can occur due to several reasons:

1. **Distressed [Sale](../s/sale.md)**: The target company may be under [financial distress](../f/financial_distress.md) and looking to sell quickly, often accepting offers below [market value](../m/market_value.md) to ensure a quick [transaction](../t/transaction.md).
2. **[Market](../m/market.md) Conditions**: [Market](../m/market.md) conditions may be favorable to buyers, leading to undervaluation of companies for various reasons, including economic downturns or sector-specific challenges.
3. **Management and Operational Inefficiencies**: The target company may suffer from poor management or operational inefficiencies, making it more valuable to an acquirer who can realize its potential by streamlining operations.
4. **Synergies Recognized by Acquirer**: The acquiring company may recognize potential synergies that the current [market](../m/market.md) does not, allowing for a lower purchase price based on the perceived future [value](../v/value.md).

## Accounting Treatment of Negative Goodwill

Negative [Goodwill](../g/goodwill.md) must be treated carefully under [accounting principles](../a/accounting_principles.md). According to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS 3 – [Business](../b/business.md) Combinations), the acquirer must reassess the identifiable assets, liabilities, and the consideration transferred to confirm the existence of NGW. If confirmed, the negative [goodwill](../g/goodwill.md) is recognized as follows:

1. **Reassessment**: Verify all acquired identifiable assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities.
2. **Recognition in [Income Statement](../i/income_statement.md)**: Any remaining excess after the reassessment should be recognized immediately as a [gain](../g/gain.md) in the [profit](../p/profit.md) and loss statement. This recognition reflects the apparent "bargain" purchase.

### Example:
```
Total [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) of net assets acquired: $1,000,000
Purchase price: $900,000

Negative [Goodwill](../g/goodwill.md): $100,000
Recognition: The $100,000 is recorded as a [gain](../g/gain.md) in the acquiring company's [income statement](../i/income_statement.md).
```

## Implications of Negative Goodwill

NGW has significant implications for both the acquiring company and the [market](../m/market.md):

1. **Immediate [Gain](../g/gain.md)**: The acquiring company recognizes an immediate [gain](../g/gain.md), potentially enhancing its profitability in the short term.
2. **[Market](../m/market.md) Perception**: It may lead to adverse [market](../m/market.md) perception of the target company, indicating [underlying](../u/underlying.md) issues or inefficiencies.
3. **Regulatory Scrutiny**: Such transactions can attract regulatory scrutiny to ensure compliance with [market](../m/market.md) norms and that the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) was conducted fairly.

## Negative Goodwill in Practice

Companies in various sectors may report NGW due to diverse [market](../m/market.md) conditions. For instance, during economic downturns or sector-specific declines, distressed assets may be acquired at a fraction of their [fair value](../f/fair_value.md), leading to NGW. 

### Case Study Example:
In a scenario where a technology [firm](../f/firm.md) acquires a competing smaller [firm](../f/firm.md) struggling with [debt](../d/debt.md), the purchase price might be significantly lesser than the smaller [firm](../f/firm.md)’s [asset valuation](../a/asset_valuation.md) after [liability](../l/liability.md) adjustments, resulting in NGW.

## Conclusion

Negative [Goodwill](../g/goodwill.md) (NGW) signals a potentially advantageous [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) for a buyer, but it also flags some [underlying](../u/underlying.md) complications with the target company. Accurate assessment and proper [accounting](../a/accounting.md) are crucial to reflect this on the acquiring company's [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md). By understanding and managing NGW effectively, companies can [leverage](../l/leverage.md) bargain purchases to their strategic advantage while maintaining [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and regulatory compliance.

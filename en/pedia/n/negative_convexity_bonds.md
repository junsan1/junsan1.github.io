# Negative Convexity Bonds

In [finance](../f/finance.md) and investments, bonds are one of the most common types of securities. They represent a [debt](../d/debt.md) obligation in which the [bond](../b/bond.md) [issuer](../i/issuer.md) borrows [capital](../c/capital.md) from the [bondholder](../b/bondholder.md) and is obligated to repay the [principal](../p/principal.md) at a later date, typically with periodic [interest](../i/interest.md) payments. Among the various attributes of bonds, "[convexity](../c/convexity.md)" is a crucial concept. [Convexity](../c/convexity.md) measures the sensitivity of the [duration](../d/duration.md) of a [bond](../b/bond.md) to changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and helps investors understand how the price of a [bond](../b/bond.md) [will](../w/will.md) change as [interest](../i/interest.md) rates change.

[Negative convexity](../n/negative_convexity.md) is a unique attribute in the context of [fixed income securities](../f/fixed_income_securities.md), particularly [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-backed securities (MBS) and callable bonds. In this article, we [will](../w/will.md) delve into the concept of [negative convexity](../n/negative_convexity.md), its causes, implications, and the impact it has on [bond](../b/bond.md) pricing and investment strategies.

## Understanding Convexity

[Convexity](../c/convexity.md) is a measure of the curvature or the degree of the curve in the relationship between the [bond](../b/bond.md) price and [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. It is a second-[order](../o/order.md) [derivative](../d/derivative.md) that stands for the rate of change of [duration](../d/duration.md) relative to changes in [yield](../y/yield.md).

Positive [convexity](../c/convexity.md) means that as yields decline, the price increases at an increasing rate, and as yields rise, the price declines at a decreasing rate. This characteristic is typical for most traditional bonds. The higher the [convexity](../c/convexity.md), the more sensitive the [bond](../b/bond.md) is to changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

### Formula for Convexity

The formula for calculating [convexity](../c/convexity.md) is as follows:

\[ \text{[Convexity](../c/convexity.md)} = \frac{1}{P \times (1 + y)^2} \sum_{t=1}^T \left( \frac{C_t \times (t^2 + t)}{(1 + y)^t} \right) \]

Where:
- \( P \) = current [bond](../b/bond.md) price
- \( y \) = [yield to maturity](../y/yield_to_maturity.md)
- \( C_t \) = [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) at time \( t \)
- \( T \) = number of periods until [maturity](../m/maturity.md)

The [convexity](../c/convexity.md) measure helps in understanding the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s sensitivity to [interest](../i/interest.md) changes, on top of what [duration](../d/duration.md) indicates.

## Negative Convexity Explained

[Negative convexity](../n/negative_convexity.md) is observed in certain types of bonds like callable bonds and [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-backed securities. These bonds exhibit an unusual price-[yield](../y/yield.md) relationship compared to bonds with positive [convexity](../c/convexity.md).

When a [bond](../b/bond.md) has [negative convexity](../n/negative_convexity.md), its price decreases more rapidly when [interest](../i/interest.md) rates rise and increases less quickly when [interest](../i/interest.md) rates fall. This means that as [interest](../i/interest.md) rates decline, the [bondholder](../b/bondholder.md)'s potential for price gains is limited, whereas losses can be substantial if [interest](../i/interest.md) rates rise. This non-[linear relationship](../l/linear_relationship.md) can create a challenging situation for investors trying to manage [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md).

### Causes of Negative Convexity

[Negative convexity](../n/negative_convexity.md) mainly arises from two primary [bond](../b/bond.md) features: call [options](../o/options.md) and [prepayment](../p/prepayment.md) [options](../o/options.md). 

1. **Callable Bonds**: Callable bonds come with an embedded [call option](../c/call_option.md), allowing the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) to repurchase the [bond](../b/bond.md) before its [maturity date](../m/maturity_date.md), often at a [premium](../p/premium.md). These bonds tend to show [negative convexity](../n/negative_convexity.md) because when [interest](../i/interest.md) rates drop significantly, issuers are more likely to call the bonds to [refinance](../r/refinance.md) at a lower rate. Investors, thus, face [reinvestment risk](../r/reinvestment_risk.md) as they might have to reinvest the [principal](../p/principal.md) at lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

2. **[Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-Backed Securities (MBS)**: [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-backed securities are backed by [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) loans with embedded [prepayment](../p/prepayment.md) [options](../o/options.md), allowing homeowners to prepay their mortgages. When [interest](../i/interest.md) rates fall, [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) holders are more inclined to [refinance](../r/refinance.md) or prepay their mortgages, leading to an increase in prepayments for the MBS. The sudden influx of [principal](../p/principal.md) repayments when [interest](../i/interest.md) rates are low forces MBS investors to reinvest at lower yields, leading to [negative convexity](../n/negative_convexity.md).

### Example of Negative Convexity

Consider a [callable bond](../c/callable_bond.md) with a [face value](../f/face_value.md) of $1,000, paying a 5% coupon, and with a callable [provision](../p/provision.md) [at par](../a/at_par.md). When [market](../m/market.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) rates fall to 3%, the price of a comparable non-[callable bond](../c/callable_bond.md) might increase significantly above $1,000, but the [callable bond](../c/callable_bond.md)’s price may increase very slightly, as investors anticipate a call. Conversely, if [interest](../i/interest.md) rates rise to 7%, the price of the [callable bond](../c/callable_bond.md) would fall sharply, similar to a non-[callable bond](../c/callable_bond.md).

## Implications of Negative Convexity

[Negative convexity](../n/negative_convexity.md) has several implications for [bond](../b/bond.md) investors and portfolio managers:

1. **[Price Sensitivity](../p/price_sensitivity.md)**: Bonds with [negative convexity](../n/negative_convexity.md) are more sensitive to [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) increases and less beneficial during [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) declines compared to bonds with positive [convexity](../c/convexity.md).
2. **[Interest Rate Risk Management](../i/interest_rate_risk_management.md)**: Managing a portfolio with bonds exhibiting [negative convexity](../n/negative_convexity.md) requires careful consideration of [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) movements and potential price changes.
3. **[Reinvestment Risk](../r/reinvestment_risk.md)**: Investors are at higher [risk](../r/risk.md) of [reinvestment](../r/reinvestment.md) at lower rates when prepayments increase, particularly for MBS and callable bonds.
4. **[Yield](../y/yield.md) Enhancement**: Due to the additional [risk](../r/risk.md), these bonds often [offer](../o/offer.md) higher yields to compensate investors for the potential disadvantages.
5. **Behavioral Adjustments**: [Negative convexity](../n/negative_convexity.md) can cause adjustments in investment behavior, steering investors towards other high-[yield](../y/yield.md) or positively convex instruments during times of falling [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

## Strategies for Managing Negative Convexity

Given the complexities and risks associated with [negative convexity](../n/negative_convexity.md), several strategies can be employed to manage and mitigate its impacts:

1. **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: Diversifying a [bond](../b/bond.md) portfolio across various durations, convexitives, and [yield](../y/yield.md) curves can help manage the overall [risk](../r/risk.md).
2. **[Derivatives](../d/derivatives.md)**: Using [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) like swaps, [options](../o/options.md), or [futures](../f/futures.md) can [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against the [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md) posed by negatively convex bonds.
3. **Selecting Intervals**: Focusing on bonds with shorter call protection periods or [prepayment](../p/prepayment.md) lockouts can reduce the [reinvestment risk](../r/reinvestment_risk.md).
4. **Adjusting [Duration](../d/duration.md)**: Matching the [portfolio duration](../p/portfolio_duration.md) with an [investor](../i/investor.md)’s [investment horizon](../i/investment_horizon.md) can minimize the mismatch during [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) changes.
5. **[Active Management](../a/active_management.md)**: [Active portfolio management](../a/active_portfolio_management.md) allows investors to respond promptly to [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) changes, adjusting their [holdings](../h/holdings.md) to optimize the [risk](../r/risk.md)-reward balance.

## Example of a Negative Convexity Bond Issuer

[Freddie Mac](../f/freddie_mac.md) and Fannie Mae are prominent issuers of [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-backed securities in the United States. These institutions create bonds backed by [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) loans, leading to [negative convexity](../n/negative_convexity.md) due to the [prepayment](../p/prepayment.md) risks associated with mortgages.

### Freddie Mac (Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation)

[Freddie Mac](../f/freddie_mac.md) is a public [government-sponsored enterprise](../g/government-sponsored_enterprise.md) (GSE), which provides [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), stability, and affordability to the U.S. housing [market](../m/market.md) by purchasing mortgages from lenders, packaging them into securities, and selling them to investors.

# Negative Arbitrage

Negative [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) is a situation in [finance](../f/finance.md) where the cost of borrowing funds is higher than the [yield](../y/yield.md) from [investing](../i/investing.md) those funds. This inverse relationship can lead to a net financial loss and is commonly encountered by [municipal bond](../m/municipal_bond.md) issuers and other organizations that engage in borrowing and [investing](../i/investing.md) activities. Negative [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) can be particularly impactful in the context of [bond](../b/bond.md) issuing, refinancing, and financial management strategies that rely on [interest rate spreads](../i/interest_rate_spreads.md) to generate [profit](../p/profit.md) or maintain financial stability.

## Overview

[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) generally refers to the simultaneous purchase and [sale](../s/sale.md) of an [asset](../a/asset.md) to [profit](../p/profit.md) from a difference in the price in different markets. While traditional [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) exploits price differences to guarantee a [risk](../r/risk.md)-free [profit](../p/profit.md), negative [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) represents the downside of this strategy—where the cost associated with the [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) opportunity surpasses the returns.

### How Negative Arbitrage Occurs

Negative [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) occurs due to various [market](../m/market.md) and economic factors, including:

1. **[Interest Rate](../i/interest_rate.md) Environment**: When borrowing costs rise or investment yields fall, the spread can become negative.
2. **Refinancing Conditions**: During [bond](../b/bond.md) refinancings, if the rates on the new [debt](../d/debt.md) are less favorable than the returns on a mandated [escrow](../e/escrow.md) of proceeds, negative [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) is realized.
3. **[Prepayment](../p/prepayment.md) and [Yield](../y/yield.md) Restrictions**: Legal limitations or [prepayment](../p/prepayment.md) penalties can lead to inefficiencies and extra costs, thereby creating a situation of negative [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md).

## Detailed Examples

### Municipal Bonds

In the [municipal bond](../m/municipal_bond.md) [market](../m/market.md), issuers sometimes face negative [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) when issuing refunding bonds. The proceeds from the new bonds are usually placed in an [escrow](../e/escrow.md) account to pay off the old bonds. If the investment [yield](../y/yield.md) on these escrowed proceeds is lower than the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) on the new bonds, the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) experiences negative [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md).

**Example Scenario**:
- A municipality issues $10M in refunding bonds at an [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) of 5%. The proceeds are invested in a Treasury [security](../s/security.md) yielding 2%.
- The municipality suffers a negative [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) as the cost of paying 5% on the new [bond](../b/bond.md) exceeds the 2% [return](../r/return.md) on the escrowed funds.

### Treasury Securities

Institutions often use Treasury securities for safety and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md). However, in a [low interest rate environment](../l/low_interest_rate_environment.md), the yields on these safe assets might be lower than the cost of borrowing funds to invest in them, leading to negative [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md).

**Example Scenario**:
- A corporate treasurer borrows $50M at 4% and invests the [money](../m/money.md) in Treasury bills yielding 1%.
- This results in a negative [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) of 3% (the difference between the borrowing cost and the investment [return](../r/return.md)).

### Arbitrage CDOs (Collateralized Debt Obligations)

In [structured finance](../s/structured_finance.md), negative [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) can be prevalent in certain CDOs, where the [interest](../i/interest.md) [income](../i/income.md) from [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets is less than the [payment](../p/payment.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md) to the senior [tranches](../t/tranches.md).

**Example Scenario**:
- A CDO issues senior [tranches](../t/tranches.md) yielding 6%, while the returns on the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [collateral](../c/collateral.md) are 4%.
- The [issuer](../i/issuer.md) experiences negative [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) due to the higher cost of funding compared to the [asset](../a/asset.md) returns.

## Management and Mitigation

### Refinancing and Restructuring Debt

One approach to managing negative [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) is through refinancing and [restructuring](../r/restructuring.md) existing [debt](../d/debt.md) to take advantage of improved [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) environments. However, this strategy must be pursued judiciously to avoid [prepayment](../p/prepayment.md) penalties and [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md) that might [offset](../o/offset.md) the benefits.

### Investment Strategies

Active [investment management](../i/investment_management.md) can help mitigate negative [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) by seeking higher-yielding investment opportunities while maintaining acceptable [risk](../r/risk.md) levels. Diversifying the investment portfolio may also reduce the impact of low-yielding investments.

### Swaps and Derivatives

Using [financial derivatives](../f/financial_derivatives.md) such as [interest rate swaps](../i/interest_rate_swaps.md), issuers can manage [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md) and potentially reduce negative [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md). Swaps allow issuers to [exchange](../e/exchange.md) variable [interest](../i/interest.md) rates for fixed rates, or vice versa, to match their [financing](../f/financing.md) and investment profiles more effectively.

### Bond Covenant Management

[Municipal bond](../m/municipal_bond.md) issuers often implement [Bond](../b/bond.md) Covenants, which are stipulations and regulations provided within the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s legal documentation. These covenants may include [yield maintenance](../y/yield_maintenance.md) agreements that minimize potential negative [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) by ensuring that investment returns align closely with borrowing costs.

## Conclusion

Negative [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) remains an important consideration for financial managers, [municipal bond](../m/municipal_bond.md) issuers, and corporate treasurers. Through careful [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md), leveraging [financial derivatives](../f/financial_derivatives.md), and [active portfolio management](../a/active_portfolio_management.md), the adverse effects of negative [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) can be mitigated, ensuring more effective financial strategies and outcomes.

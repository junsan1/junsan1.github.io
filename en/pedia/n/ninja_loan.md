# NINJA Loan

A NINJA [loan](../l/loan.md) is a specific type of subprime lending product that stands for "No [Income](../i/income.md), No Job, and No Assets." This term was primarily popularized during the 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md), which saw the collapse of several major financial institutions and a significant downturn in the global [economy](../e/economy.md). NINJA loans represent one of the riskiest types of [credit](../c/credit.md) given out before the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) and are emblematic of the lax lending standards that characterized the [subprime mortgage](../s/subprime_mortgage.md) boom.

## Definition and Features

A NINJA [loan](../l/loan.md) is a type of [loan](../l/loan.md) that does not require the borrower to provide proof of [income](../i/income.md), employment, or assets. This makes it distinct from traditional loans, which typically necessitate a thorough vetting process involving [credit](../c/credit.md) scores, employment verification, and the evaluation of financial assets. The primary features of NINJA loans can be summarized as follows:

- **No Proof of [Income](../i/income.md)**: Borrowers are not required to show any form of [income](../i/income.md) verification, such as pay stubs, tax returns, or [bank](../b/bank.md) statements.
- **No Proof of Employment**: There is no employment verification, meaning borrowers are not required to prove they have a job.
- **No Proof of Assets**: Borrowers do not need to provide evidence of assets like property, savings, or investments.

## Origins and Popularity

NINJA loans became popular during the housing boom of the early 2000s. Lenders were eager to extend [credit](../c/credit.md) to as many people as possible, often under the assumption that rising property values would mitigate the [risk](../r/risk.md) of [default](../d/default.md). The boom led to a surge in the issuance of [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-backed securities (MBS), instruments that pooled various types of loans, including high-[risk](../r/risk.md) mortgages like NINJA loans.

The basic rationale behind issuing these loans was the belief that [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) prices would continue to rise indefinitely. This meant that even if a borrower defaulted, the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) property could be sold at a higher price, thus mitigating the [lender](../l/lender.md)'s [risk](../r/risk.md).

## Role in the Financial Crisis

NINJA loans played a significant role in the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) of 2008. These loans were often bundled into complex financial products such as [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-backed securities (MBS) and collateralized [debt](../d/debt.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md) (CDOs), which were then sold to investors around the world. The widespread issuance and [sale](../s/sale.md) of these risky loans and their associated products contributed to the instability of the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md):

1. **Increased [Default](../d/default.md) Rates**: NINJA loans had higher [default](../d/default.md) rates due to the absence of traditional lending criteria. This led to increased delinquencies and foreclosures.
2. **[Housing Bubble](../h/housing_bubble.md)**: The ease of obtaining a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md), irrespective of an individual's financial situation, inflated the housing [market](../m/market.md). When the bubble burst, [home](../h/home.md) prices plummeted, leaving many borrowers with [underwater](../u/underwater.md) mortgages.
3. **Financial Instability**: Banks and financial institutions that held large amounts of MBS filled with NINJA loans found themselves in precarious financial positions. The [value](../v/value.md) of these securities plummeted, contributing to the failure of major institutions like [Lehman Brothers](../l/lehman_brothers.md) and the need for government bailouts.

## Regulatory Response

The fallout from the widespread issuance of NINJA loans led to significant regulatory changes aimed at preventing a recurrence of such risky lending practices:

- **[Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act](../d/dodd-frank_wall_street_reform_and_consumer_protection_act.md) (2010)**: One of the most significant regulatory responses to the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md), this Act introduced a [range](../r/range.md) of measures to increase [transparency](../t/transparency.md) in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), improve consumer protections, and reduce the [risk](../r/risk.md) of financial products. Key provisions included the establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and stricter oversight of [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) lending practices.
- **[Qualified Mortgage](../q/qualified_mortgage.md) Rule**: This rule, implemented as part of the Dodd-Frank Act, defines standards for a "[qualified mortgage](../q/qualified_mortgage.md)." These standards require that lenders verify and document a borrowerâ€™s ability to repay the [loan](../l/loan.md). This effectively eliminates the possibility of issuing NINJA loans.
- **[Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md)**: An international regulatory framework, [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md) aimed to strengthen [bank capital](../b/bank_capital.md) requirements and introduce new regulatory requirements on [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and [leverage](../l/leverage.md). These measures were designed to enhance the financial resilience of banks.

## Conclusion

NINJA loans represent a segment of the financial [market](../m/market.md)'s history that underscores the risks associated with lax lending practices and inadequate regulatory oversight. The widespread issuance of these loans contributed significantly to the financial instability that precipitated the global [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) of 2008. Regulatory measures introduced in the aftermath aim to ensure that such high-[risk](../r/risk.md) lending practices do not recur, emphasizing the importance of borrower verification and financial stability.

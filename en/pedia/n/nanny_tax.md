# Nanny Tax

The term "Nanny Tax" refers to the federal [payroll](../p/payroll.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) that employers need to withhold and pay for [household employees](../h/household_employee.md). Though the term specifically mentions nannies, it applies to all domestic workers, including housekeepers, gardeners, and personal caregivers. The Nanny Tax encompasses [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) and Medicare [taxes](../t/taxes.md) (FICA), federal [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) (FUTA), and potentially state employment [taxes](../t/taxes.md).

## Introduction

When households employ individuals to work in their [home](../h/home.md), they move into the arena of being an employer, which brings its own set of tax [obligations](../o/obligation.md). The distinction between a household employee and an [independent contractor](../i/independent_contractor.md) is particularly significant in this context. Generally, if the household controls not just what work is done but how it is done, the worker is regarded as an employee.

Understanding the implications and responsibilities tied to the Nanny Tax can be complex but crucial for compliance with federal and state laws. Failure to adhere to these regulations can result in penalties, [interest](../i/interest.md), and additional [taxes](../t/taxes.md).

## Who Needs to Pay Nanny Tax?

Nanny Tax applies if:

1. You paid a household employee $2,400 or more in a calendar year (2022 threshold).
2. You paid a household employee $1,000 or more in a calendar quarter.

[Household employees](../h/household_employee.md) include any worker who performs domestic services in a private [home](../h/home.md), local college club, or local chapter of a college fraternity or sorority. Examples of [household employees](../h/household_employee.md) are babysitters, maids, butlers, gardeners, and other domestic workers.

## Components of Nanny Tax

### Social Security and Medicare Taxes

[Social Security](../s/social_security.md) and Medicare [taxes](../t/taxes.md), also known as FICA (Federal [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) Contributions Act) [taxes](../t/taxes.md), are crucial components of the Nanny Tax. The employer is responsible for [withholding](../w/withholding.md) 6.2% for [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) and 1.45% for Medicare from the employee's wages, and matching these amounts. In 2022, if the household employee earns $147,000 or less, the [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md) of 6.2% applies up to that wage base. Medicare [taxes](../t/taxes.md) apply to all wages without a wage base cap.

### Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA)

The FUTA tax is used to [fund](../f/fund.md) state workforce agencies and [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) [insurance](../i/insurance.md). Only the employer pays FUTA [taxes](../t/taxes.md), not the employee. The FUTA [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md) is 6.0% on the first $7,000 in wages paid to each household employee per year. Employers may receive a federal [tax credit](../t/tax_credit.md) of up to 5.4% for state [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) paid, effectively reducing the rate to 0.6%.

### State Employment Taxes

Various states require additional employment [taxes](../t/taxes.md), which may include state [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) [insurance](../i/insurance.md) (SUI) and [workers' compensation](../w/workers'_compensation.md) [insurance](../i/insurance.md). The rates and requirements for these [taxes](../t/taxes.md) vary by state, and employers must [check](../c/check.md) with their state labor or employment department for specific regulations.

## Employer Responsibilities

### Applying for an Employer Identification Number (EIN)

Household employers need to obtain an Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the IRS. This number is used for [payroll tax](../p/payroll_tax.md) reporting and filing. An EIN can be obtained online via the IRS website.

### Withholding and Paying Taxes

Employers must withhold [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) and Medicare [taxes](../t/taxes.md) from their employees' wages and pay a matching amount, along with FUTA [taxes](../t/taxes.md). This involves calculating the appropriate amounts each pay period and remitting the [taxes](../t/taxes.md) to the IRS on a quarterly [basis](../b/basis.md) using Form 1040 and Schedule H.

### Wage Reporting

Employers are required to report the wages paid to [household employees](../h/household_employee.md) on Form W-2. The Form W-2 should be provided to the employee by January 31 following the tax year, and copies should be sent to the [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) Administration (SSA) by the same deadline.

### Filing Schedule H

Household employers must file Schedule H (Household Employment [Taxes](../t/taxes.md)) with their [federal income](../f/federal_income.md) [tax return](../t/tax_return.md) (Form 1040). Schedule H details the employerâ€™s share of [Social Security](../s/social_security.md), Medicare, and [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) for the [household employees](../h/household_employee.md).

## Record-Keeping

Proper documentation is crucial for household employers. It includes:

1. Employment agreements or contracts.
2. Wage records showing wages paid and [taxes](../t/taxes.md) withheld.
3. Tax [deposit](../d/deposit.md) [receipts](../r/receipt.md).
4. Copies of filed tax forms (W-2, Schedule H, etc.).

Records should be kept for at least four years after the due date of the [tax return](../t/tax_return.md) or the date the [taxes](../t/taxes.md) were paid, whichever is later.

## Importance of Compliance

Failure to comply with Nanny Tax [obligations](../o/obligation.md) can lead to significant consequences. Employers may face penalties, [interest](../i/interest.md) on unpaid [taxes](../t/taxes.md), and potential legal actions. Ensuring compliance not only avoids legal problems but also provides social benefits like [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) and Medicare coverage for [household employees](../h/household_employee.md).

## Tax Software and Professional Assistance

Given the complexity of household employment [taxes](../t/taxes.md), many employers turn to tax software or professional tax preparers to manage their [obligations](../o/obligation.md). Tax preparation software often includes features specifically for household employers, automating much of the calculation and filing process.

For instance, Intuit's QuickBooks or H&R Block's tax preparation services can provide tools and [guidance](../g/guidance.md) for employers handling [payroll](../p/payroll.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) for household workers. Here are their official websites for reference:

## Conclusion

The Nanny Tax is an essential part of household employment, ensuring that domestic workers receive their appropriate [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) and Medicare benefits. For household employers, understanding and adhering to these tax [obligations](../o/obligation.md) is critical to maintaining compliance with federal and state regulations. Proper record-keeping, timely filing, and leveraging professional resources can simplify this complex area and prevent potential legal or financial repercussions.

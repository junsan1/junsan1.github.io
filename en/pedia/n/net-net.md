# Net-Net

## Introduction

In the realm of [finance](../f/finance.md) and investment, the term "Net-Net" refers to a specific strategy popularized by [Benjamin Graham](../b/benjamin_graham.md), known as the "father of [value investing](../v/value_investing.md)." This [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) focuses on identifying companies that are trading at a significant [discount](../d/discount.md) to their net current [asset](../a/asset.md) [value](../v/value.md) (NCAV). The concept originates from Graham's principles in his seminal work, "The Intelligent [Investor](../i/investor.md)," where he outlined his methodology for finding deeply [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md). The Net-Net strategy is a classic form of [value investing](../v/value_investing.md) and is often associated with finding "cigar butt" [stocks](../s/stock.md)â€”companies that are financially distressed but have [residual value](../r/residual_value.md).

## Definition

The term "Net-Net" represents a calculation to determine the [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) of a company based on its [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md), particularly its [current assets](../c/current_assets.md) and liabilities. The formula for calculating the NCAV is:

```
NCAV = [Current Assets](../c/current_assets.md) - [Total Liabilities](../t/total_liabilities.md)
```

In other words, the Net-Net [value](../v/value.md) of a [firm](../f/firm.md) is the net [current assets](../c/current_assets.md), which is the difference between the [firm](../f/firm.md)'s [current assets](../c/current_assets.md) (cash, receivables, [inventory](../i/inventory.md)) and its [total liabilities](../t/total_liabilities.md) (both current and non-current). A company is considered a Net-Net if its [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) is less than its NCAV, implying it is trading at a substantial [discount](../d/discount.md) to its [liquidation value](../l/liquidation_value.md).

## Criteria for Net-Net Stocks

To qualify as a Net-Net stock, several criteria are generally evaluated:

1. **[Current Ratio](../c/current_ratio.md)**: The company should have a high [current ratio](../c/current_ratio.md) ([current assets](../c/current_assets.md) divided by [current liabilities](../c/current_liabilities.md)), typically greater than 2. This indicates that the company has sufficient [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) to cover its short-term [obligations](../o/obligation.md).

2. **Low Price-to-NCAV**: The stock's price should be lower than its NCAV per share. Typically, a stock trading at 66% or less of its NCAV is considered a Net-Net.

3. **[Market](../m/market.md) Cap**: The [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) of the company should be small, as larger companies rarely [trade](../t/trade.md) at such distressed levels.

4. **[Financial Health](../f/financial_health.md)**: While many Net-Net [stocks](../s/stock.md) are distressed, some level of [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) is desired. This could include positive [earnings](../e/earnings.md), low [debt](../d/debt.md) levels, or a history of profitability.

5. **[Industry](../i/industry.md) Considerations**: Companies in industries prone to cyclic downturns or structural declines might frequently appear as Net-Nets, so sector-specific risks need to be evaluated.

## How to Identify Net-Net Stocks

### Screening Tools

Investors can use various screening tools to identify potential Net-Net [stocks](../s/stock.md). Some popular financial data providers include:

- **[Yahoo Finance](../y/yahoo_finance.md)**: Allows users to screen for [stocks](../s/stock.md) based on various financial criteria, including [current assets](../c/current_assets.md) and liabilities.
- **Finviz**: A [stock screener](../s/stock_screener.md) that offers filters for [financial ratios](../f/financial_ratios.md) and [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) data.
- **GuruFocus**: Provides comprehensive data on [value investing](../v/value_investing.md) metrics, including NCAV calculations.

### Manual Analysis

**Step-by-Step Process**:

1. **Collect [Financial Statements](../f/financial_statements.md)**: Obtain the company's latest financial reports, including the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md), [income statement](../i/income_statement.md), and [cash flow statement](../c/cash_flow_statement.md).
  
2. **Calculate [Current Assets](../c/current_assets.md)**: Sum the company's cash, [cash equivalents](../c/cash_equivalents.md), accounts [receivable](../r/receivable.md), and [inventory](../i/inventory.md).

3. **Calculate [Total Liabilities](../t/total_liabilities.md)**: Sum both current and [long-term liabilities](../l/long-term_liabilities.md) from the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md).

4. **Determine NCAV**: Subtract [total liabilities](../t/total_liabilities.md) from [current assets](../c/current_assets.md) to obtain the NCAV.

5. **Compare to [Market](../m/market.md) Cap**: Divide the NCAV by the number of outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md) to get the NCAV per share. Compare this to the current stock price.

## Risks and Considerations

Although Net-Net [stocks](../s/stock.md) can [offer](../o/offer.md) significant [upside potential](../u/upside_potential_in_trading.md), they come with a variety of risks:

1. **[Financial Distress](../f/financial_distress.md)**: Many Net-Net [stocks](../s/stock.md) are in poor [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and may face [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) or severe operational challenges.
  
2. **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) Issues**: Small-cap [stocks](../s/stock.md) often have lower [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), making it difficult to buy or sell large positions without affecting the stock price.

3. **Limited Information**: Smaller and distressed companies may provide less [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and have less analyst coverage, making it harder to assess their true financial condition.

4. **[Market Timing](../m/market_timing.md)**: [Timing the market](../t/timing_the_market.md) entry and exit is crucial. Holding a Net-Net stock too long could result in [value](../v/value.md) erosion if the company continues to deteriorate.

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Company X

**Background**: Company X is a small-cap manufacturer facing operational issues and declining sales. The stock price has plummeted over the past year.

**Financials**:
- [Current Assets](../c/current_assets.md): $150 million
- [Total Liabilities](../t/total_liabilities.md): $100 million
- Outstanding [Shares](../s/shares.md): 10 million
- Current Stock Price: $4

**NCAV Calculation**:
```
NCAV = $150 million - $100 million = $50 million
NCAV per share = $50 million / 10 million [shares](../s/shares.md) = $5
```

Since Company X's stock price ($4) is below its NCAV per share ($5), it qualifies as a Net-Net stock.

### Case Study 2: Company Y

**Background**: Company Y operates in the retail sector, which has been hit hard by economic downturns. The company's [revenue](../r/revenue.md) has been stable, but margins have contracted.

**Financials**:
- [Current Assets](../c/current_assets.md): $80 million
- [Total Liabilities](../t/total_liabilities.md): $60 million
- Outstanding [Shares](../s/shares.md): 5 million
- Current Stock Price: $8

**NCAV Calculation**:
```
NCAV = $80 million - $60 million = $20 million
NCAV per share = $20 million / 5 million [shares](../s/shares.md) = $4
```

Since Company Y's stock price ($8) is above its NCAV per share ($4), it does not qualify as a Net-Net stock.

## Modern Applications

While traditional Net-Net [investing](../i/investing.md) focused on manual analysis of [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md), modern algorithms and fintech solutions have streamlined the process. Platforms like [QuantConnect](../q/quantconnect.md) and [Alpaca](../a/alpaca.md) allow investors to build and backtest [algorithmic trading strategies](../a/algorithmic_trading_strategies.md), including those based on Net-Net criteria.

### Algorithmic Trading

**Steps to Implement a Net-Net Algorithm**:

1. **Data Collection**: Use APIs to gather financial statement data.
2. **Screening**: Implement the NCAV calculation and other criteria within your algorithm.
3. **[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md)**: Test the effectiveness of your strategy using historical data.
4. **[Execution](../e/execution.md)**: Deploy the algorithm in a live [trading environment](../t/trading_environment.md).

**Example**:

```python
# Pseudo-code for a Net-Net trading strategy
def net_net_strategy(stock_list):
    selected_stocks = []
    for stock in stock_list:
        financials = get_financials(stock)
        ncav = financials['current_assets'] - financials['total_liabilities']
        ncav_per_share = ncav / financials['outstanding_shares']
        if financials['stock_price'] < ncav_per_share * 0.66:
            selected_stocks.append(stock)
    [return](../r/return.md) selected_stocks
```

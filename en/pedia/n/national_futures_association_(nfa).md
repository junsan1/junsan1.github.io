# National Futures Association (NFA)

The National Futures Association (NFA) is an industry-wide, self-regulatory organization for the U.S. derivatives industry, including on-exchange traded futures, retail off-exchange foreign currency (forex), and OTC (over-the-counter) derivatives (also known as swap transactions). The NFA was founded in 1982 to ensure that every firm and individual who conducts futures trading in the U.S. follows the same high standards of professional conduct.

## Origins and History

The establishment of the NFA was sanctioned by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) under the authority granted by the Commodity Exchange Act. The primary goal was to create a more accountable regulation structure to protect investors and ensure the integrity of the futures markets. Before the establishment of the NFA, there was no comprehensive regulatory framework exclusively dedicated to the oversight of futures trading.

## Mission and Objectives

The NFA operates with a clear mission to safeguard market integrity, protect investors, and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. The core objectives include:

1. **Investor Protection**
2. **Market Integrity**

These objectives are achieved through diligent monitoring, regular audits, and aggressive enforcement of compliance rules. 

## Membership Requirements

All professionals and firms involved in the futures industry are required to register with the NFA, which includes futures commission merchants (FCMs), introducing brokers (IBs), commodity trading advisors (CTAs), commodity pool operators (CPOs), and retail foreign exchange dealers (RFEDs).

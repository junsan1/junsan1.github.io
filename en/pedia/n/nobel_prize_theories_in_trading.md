# Nobel Prize Theories

The field of trading and [finance](../f/finance.md) has been significantly influenced by a number of theories developed by Nobel Prize laureates. These theories have provided frameworks and insights that underpin much of modern trading, investment strategies, and financial [market](../m/market.md) analysis. Below are several pivotal theories and contributions by Nobel Prize winners that are often referenced in the context of trading:

## Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)

**Laureates**: Paul Samuelson (1970), Eugene Fama (2013)

The [Efficient Market Hypothesis](../e/efficient_market_hypothesis.md) (EMH) is a cornerstone of modern financial theory and was primarily developed by Eugene Fama. Fama's work on EMH, which earned him the Nobel Prize in 2013, suggests that [asset](../a/asset.md) prices fully reflect all available information. This implies three forms:

- **Weak Form**: Stock prices already reflect all past trading information, rendering [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) ineffective.
- **Semi-Strong Form**: Stock prices adjust to publicly available new information rapidly and in an unbiased fashion, making [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md) less useful for gaining an advantage.
- **Strong Form**: Stock prices reflect all information, both public and private, meaning even insider information cannot give an edge.

Given these premises, EMH posits that it is impossible to consistently achieve higher returns than the overall [market](../m/market.md) through expert stock selection or [market timing](../m/market_timing.md). As a result, the hypothesis supports [passive investment strategies](../p/passive_investment_strategies.md) such as [index fund](../i/index_fund.md) [investing](../i/investing.md).

## Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)

**Laureate**: [Harry Markowitz](../h/harry_markowitz.md) (1990)

[Harry Markowitz](../h/harry_markowitz.md)'s Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) revolutionized the understanding of investment [diversification](../d/diversification.md). Awarded the Nobel Prize in 1990, Markowitz's MPT introduces the idea of an **[efficient frontier](../e/efficient_frontier.md)**, a set of optimal portfolios that [offer](../o/offer.md) the highest [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) for a given level of [risk](../r/risk.md). 

Key concepts of MPT include:

- **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: Reducing portfolio [risk](../r/risk.md) by holding a variety of assets.
- **[Risk](../r/risk.md)-[Return](../r/return.md) [Trade](../t/trade.md)-Off**: Balancing the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) against the [risk](../r/risk.md) of the portfolio.
- **[Covariance](../c/covariance.md)**: Assessing how different assets move in relation to each other to construct a portfolio that minimizes [risk](../r/risk.md) for a given [return](../r/return.md).

These concepts have laid the groundwork for modern [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) techniques and the construction of diversified investment portfolios.

## Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT)

**Laureate**: Stephen A. Ross (never won a Nobel Prize, but widely recognized in the [industry](../i/industry.md) and academia)

Stephen Ross's [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) Pricing Theory (APT) is a [multi-factor model](../m/multi-factor_model.md) for [asset](../a/asset.md) pricing. Though Ross did not win a Nobel Prize, his APT is often discussed in the context of other theories that have gained Nobel recognition. The APT framework identifies [multiple](../m/multiple.md) factors that might affect an [asset](../a/asset.md)’s returns, such as [inflation](../i/inflation.md), [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, and industrial production. Unlike the CAPM which relies on a single [market risk](../m/market_risk.md) [factor](../f/factor.md), APT allows for [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [systematic risk](../s/systematic_risk.md) factors, albeit with the complex requirement of identifying the correct factors affecting price.

APT assumes that if the returns of a portfolio are created with a combination of different factors, then no [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) opportunities (i.e., [risk](../r/risk.md)-free [profit](../p/profit.md)) [will](../w/will.md) exist, as mispricings would be quickly corrected by the [market](../m/market.md) participants.

## Behavioral Finance (Prospect Theory)

**Laureates**: Daniel Kahneman (2002), Robert Shiller (2013), Richard Thaler (2017)

[Behavioral finance](../b/behavioral_finance.md) incorporates cognitive psychology into [finance](../f/finance.md) to explain why investors often behave irrationally. Daniel Kahneman, a psychologist by training, won the Nobel Prize in 2002 for his work on [prospect theory](../p/prospect_theory_in_trading.md), which he developed with Amos Tversky.

[Prospect theory](../p/prospect_theory_in_trading.md) describes how people make decisions under [risk](../r/risk.md) and [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md), highlighting several biases:
 
- **[Loss Aversion](../l/loss_aversion.md)**: Investors are more sensitive to losses than gains of the same size.
- **Overconfidence**: Investors overestimate their ability to predict [market](../m/market.md) movements.
- **[Herd Behavior](../h/herd_behavior_in_trading.md)**: Investors tend to follow the crowd, which can amplify [market](../m/market.md) trends.
- **[Anchoring](../a/anchoring.md)**: Investors rely too heavily on the first piece of information (such as the purchase price of a stock) when making decisions.

Robert Shiller, awarded the Nobel Prize in 2013, expanded on these ideas, showing how irrational behavior and psychological factors can lead to [market anomalies](../m/market_anomalies.md) and [bubbles](../b/bubble.md). Richard Thaler, awarded in 2017, further explored how [psychological biases](../p/psychological_biases_in_trading.md) and anomalies impact economic decision-making.

## Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

**Laureate**: [William F. Sharpe](../w/william_f._sharpe.md) (1990)

The [Capital Asset](../c/capital_asset.md) Pricing Model (CAPM), developed by William Sharpe, John Lintner, and Jan Mossin, addresses how securities should be priced in the [market](../m/market.md). Sharpe received the Nobel Prize in 1990 for his contributions.

CAPM describes the relationship between [systematic risk](../s/systematic_risk.md) and [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) for assets, particularly [stocks](../s/stock.md). The formula for CAPM is expressed as:

\[ E(R_i) = R_f + \beta_i (E(R_m) - R_f) \]

Where:
- \(E(R_i)\) is the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) of the investment.
- \(R_f\) is the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate.
- \(\beta_i\) is the [beta](../b/beta.md) of the investment.
- \(E(R_m)\) is the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) of the [market](../m/market.md).
- \(E(R_m) - R_f\) is the [market risk premium](../m/market_risk_premium.md).

CAPM posits that the only [risk](../r/risk.md) priced by the [market](../m/market.md) is [systemic risk](../s/systemic_risk.md) ([market risk](../m/market_risk.md)), as other forms of [risk](../r/risk.md) can be diversified away. This model has been crucial in [asset](../a/asset.md) pricing, [portfolio optimization](../p/portfolio_optimization.md), and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md).

## Black-Scholes-Merton Model

**Laureates**: Robert C. Merton (1997), Myron Scholes (1997) (Fischer Black (posthumous, not officially awarded))

The [Black-Scholes model](../b/black-scholes_model.md), developed by Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and later expanded by Robert Merton, revolutionized [options](../o/options.md) trading. The model provided a theoretical estimate of the price of European-style [options](../o/options.md) and introduced concepts like "the [Greeks](../g/greeks.md)," which measure sensitivity to various parameters.

The formula for the [Black-Scholes model](../b/black-scholes_model.md) is:

\[ C = S_0 N(d_1) - X e^{-rT} N(d_2) \]

Where:
- \(C\) is the [call option](../c/call_option.md) price.
- \(S_0\) is the current stock price.
- \(X\) is the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).
- \(r\) is the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md).
- \(T\) is the time to [maturity](../m/maturity.md).
- \(N()\) is the [cumulative distribution function](../c/cumulative_distribution_function_in_trading.md) of the standard [normal distribution](../n/normal_distribution_in_trading.md).
- \(d1 = \frac{ln(S0/X) + (r + \frac{σ^2}{2}) T}{σ \sqrt{T}}\)
- \(d2 = d1 - σ\sqrt{T}\)

This model remains a fundamental tool in trading for pricing [options](../o/options.md), managing portfolios of [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), and in the overall field of [quantitative finance](../q/quantitative_finance.md).

## Nobel Prize Theories in Derivative Pricing and Usage

The various Nobel Prize-winning theories not only underscore the importance of quantitative methods in [finance](../f/finance.md) but also provide a spectrum of approaches to [asset](../a/asset.md) pricing, [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), portfolio construction, and [market](../m/market.md) behavior. The application of these theories has transformed how modern trading and investment strategies are developed and implemented.

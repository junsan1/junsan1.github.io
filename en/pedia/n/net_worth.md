# Net Worth

Net worth is a fundamental financial metric that represents the monetary [value](../v/value.md) of an individual's or organization's assets minus their liabilities. It provides a snapshot of [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and stability at a particular point in time. Net worth is commonly used by financial planners, investors, and individuals to assess how [wealth](../w/wealth.md) is accumulated and to track financial progress over time.

## Components of Net Worth

### Assets
Assets are resources with [economic value](../e/economic_value.md) that an individual, [corporation](../c/corporation.md), or country owns or controls with the expectation of future benefits. Assets are generally divided into current and non-current categories:

#### Current Assets
[Current assets](../c/current_assets.md) are short-term assets that are expected to be converted into cash within one year. They include:
- **Cash and [Cash Equivalents](../c/cash_equivalents.md):** [Money](../m/money.md) in hand and deposits.
- **[Marketable Securities](../m/marketable_securities.md):** [Stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, and other securities that can be liquidated quickly.
- **Accounts [Receivable](../r/receivable.md):** [Money](../m/money.md) owed by customers from sales.
- **[Inventory](../i/inventory.md):** Goods available for [sale](../s/sale.md).

#### Non-Current Assets
Non-[current assets](../c/current_assets.md), also known as [long-term assets](../l/long-term_assets.md), are expected to provide economic benefits beyond one year. They include:
- **[Real Estate](../r/real_estate.md):** Land and buildings.
- **Vehicles and Equipment:** Machinery and transportation vehicles used in operations.
- **Investments:** [Long-term investments](../l/long-term_investments.md) in [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, and other financial instruments.
- **Intangible Assets:** Patents, trademarks, and [goodwill](../g/goodwill.md).

### Liabilities
Liabilities are [obligations](../o/obligation.md) or debts that an individual or organization needs to settle in the future. They are also divided into current and non-current categories:

#### Current Liabilities
[Current liabilities](../c/current_liabilities.md) are short-term debts due within one year. They include:
- **Accounts Payable:** [Money](../m/money.md) owed to suppliers for goods and services.
- **Short-Term Loans:** Loans that need to be repaid within a year.
- **Accrued Expenses:** Expenses incurred but not yet paid, such as wages and [taxes](../t/taxes.md).

#### Non-Current Liabilities
Non-[current liabilities](../c/current_liabilities.md) are long-term debts due beyond one year. They include:
- **Mortgages:** Loans used to purchase [real estate](../r/real_estate.md).
- **Long-Term Loans:** Loans with maturities extending beyond a year.
- **Bonds Payable:** [Debt](../d/debt.md) securities issued to investors.

## How to Calculate Net Worth

The formula for calculating net worth is straightforward:
\[ \text{Net Worth} = \text{Total Assets} - \text{[Total Liabilities](../t/total_liabilities.md)} \]

### Example Calculation
Suppose an individual has the following assets and liabilities:

**Assets:**
- [Home](../h/home.md): \$300,000
- Car: \$20,000
- Savings: \$50,000
- [Stocks](../s/stock.md): \$30,000

**Liabilities:**
- [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md): \$200,000
- Car [Loan](../l/loan.md): \$10,000
- [Credit Card](../c/credit_card.md) [Debt](../d/debt.md): \$5,000

Using the formula, the net worth would be:
\[ \text{Net Worth} = (300,000 + 20,000 + 50,000 + 30,000) - (200,000 + 10,000 + 5,000) \]
\[ \text{Net Worth} = 400,000 - 215,000 \]
\[ \text{Net Worth} = 185,000 \]

## Importance of Net Worth

Net worth is crucial for [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md) as it provides insight into an individual's or organization's financial position. It helps in setting realistic financial goals and tracking progress.

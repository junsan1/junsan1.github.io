# Nontariff Barrier

In international [trade](../t/trade.md) and [economics](../e/economics.md), nontariff barriers (NTBs) refer to restrictive regulations and policies other than tariffs that countries use to control the amount of [trade](../t/trade.md) crossing their borders. While tariffs are direct [taxes](../t/taxes.md) or financial charges placed on imported goods, NTBs are more subtle and can be more effective in restricting international [trade](../t/trade.md). Nontariff barriers can take various forms including [quotas](../q/quota.md), embargoes, sanctions, levies, and other restrictions that countries employ to protect domestic industries from foreign competition. The objective of NTBs generally aligns with goals such as promoting local industries, ensuring national [security](../s/security.md), or safeguarding public health.

## Types of Nontariff Barriers

### 1. Quotas
[Quotas](../q/quota.md) are direct quantitative restrictions on the amount of a specific product that can be imported or exported during a given timeframe. They limit the quantity of goods to control [supply](../s/supply.md) and influence [market](../m/market.md) prices. There are different types of [quotas](../q/quota.md):
   
   - **Global [Quotas](../q/quota.md)**: Apply to total quantity irrespective of source.
   
   - **Allocated [Quotas](../q/quota.md)**: Specific limits are set for different countries.

### 2. Import Licensing
[Import](../i/import.md) licensing measures require importers to obtain permission from the relevant authorities before bringing goods into the country. This process may involve extensive documentation and compliance with various regulations, which can act as a formidable barrier to [trade](../t/trade.md). 

### 3. Standards and Regulations
Countries establish standards and regulations concerning product safety, health, and environmental impact. These may include:
   
   - **Technical Standards**: Given specifications that products must meet.
   
   - **Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures**: Rules to protect humans, animals, and plants from diseases and contaminants.

### 4. Subsidies
Subsidies are monetary grants given by governments to domestic companies to support them financially. They make local products cheaper and more competitive compared to foreign imports. 

### 5. Customs Procedures
Complex and lengthy customs procedures can delay shipments and add to the cost of exporting and importing goods. Bureaucratic red tape, extensive forms, and slow processing times can act as significant barriers. 

### 6. Embargoes and Sanctions
Embargoes are official bans on [trade](../t/trade.md) or commercial activity with specific countries, often imposed for political reasons. Sanctions are restrictions put in place to limit [trade](../t/trade.md) in certain goods or with certain entities.

### 7. Local Content Requirements
These stipulate that a certain percentage of a product must be produced domestically using local labor and materials. This can limit the use of foreign components in the production process.

## Economic Implications

### Trade Reduction
One of the most direct impacts of NTBs is a reduction in international [trade](../t/trade.md) volumes. By setting higher standards or enforcing [import](../i/import.md) licenses, governments can effectively reduce the competitiveness of imported goods, leading to lower [trade](../t/trade.md) volumes.

### Price Increases
NTBs often result in increased costs for companies that have to comply with regulations or face [supply](../s/supply.md) shortages due to [quotas](../q/quota.md) or embargoes. These additional costs are usually passed on to consumers, leading to higher prices for goods.

### Protectionism
NTBs serve as tools for [protectionism](../p/protectionism.md), allowing domestic industries to grow without facing intense competition from foreign companies. While this can be beneficial in the short term, it may reduce the incentive for local industries to innovate and improve [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) in the long term.

### Political Implications
Sanctions and embargoes are primarily driven by political motives, aiming to apply economic pressure on countries to achieve foreign policy objectives.

## Examples of Nontariff Barriers

### United States
The United States has employed various NTBs, such as imposing stringent sanitary and phytosanitary standards on agricultural products from other countries to protect public health and domestic industries.

### European Union
The [European Union](../e/european_union_(eu).md) has extensive regulations concerning product safety, environmental impact, and health standards. These regulations can act as significant barriers for non-EU countries aiming to [export](../e/export.md) their goods to the EU [market](../m/market.md).

## World Trade Organization (WTO) and NTBs

The World [Trade](../t/trade.md) Organization (WTO) aims to facilitate international [trade](../t/trade.md) by eliminating various barriers including Nontariff Barriers. WTO agreements such as the Agreement on Technical Barriers to [Trade](../t/trade.md) (TBT) and the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) focus on ensuring that regulations, standards, testing, and certification procedures do not create unnecessary obstacles to [trade](../t/trade.md).

## Mitigating Nontariff Barriers

### Trade Agreements
Countries can negotiate bilateral or multilateral [trade](../t/trade.md) agreements that aim to reduce or eliminate various NTBs. For instance, Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), and the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) include provisions to reduce NTBs.

### Diplomatic Negotiations
Diplomatic channels can be employed to negotiate the reduction or removal of NTBs. These negotiations often occur at high levels of government and can involve compromises on other issues.

### Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs)
Countries sometimes enter into MRAs that recognize each other's regulatory and testing standards. This can significantly reduce the barriers posed by differing national standards.

## Conclusion

Nontariff barriers are complex and multifaceted tools employed by countries to regulate international [trade](../t/trade.md). While they serve various policy objectives, they can also pose significant hurdles for global [commerce](../c/commerce.md). Comprehensive international efforts, including [trade](../t/trade.md) negotiations and multilateral agreements, are essential for mitigating the adverse effects of NTBs and fostering more [open](../o/open.md) and competitive international markets.

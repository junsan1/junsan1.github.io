The association works to provide a forum for these regulators to coordinate their regulatory activities and share information, thereby enhancing the integrity of the securities markets.

## Overview

NASAA's mission centers on protecting investors from fraud, promoting investor education, and ensuring that financial markets operate fairly and efficiently. The organization accomplishes this through policy development, regulatory coordination, and educational initiatives.

### Structure and Membership

NASAA's membership comprises securities regulators from:
- 50 U.S. states
- The District of Columbia

Each jurisdiction has its own securities regulatory agency, and representatives from these agencies form the NASAA membership. The association operates through various committees and project groups that focus on specific issues ranging from enforcement and compliance to investor education.

## Objectives

NASAA's primary objectives include:

## Key Areas of Focus

### Regulatory Framework

NASAA plays an essential role in developing and advocating for regulatory policies that enhance investor protection. The organization works closely with federal agencies like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), as well as with international regulatory bodies. NASAA's committees regularly publish reports, guidelines, and model rules which state regulators can adopt or adapt to address specific regulatory challenges.

### Enforcement

One of NASAA’s critical functions is to support and coordinate enforcement actions among its member jurisdictions. NASAA provides a centralized platform for sharing information about ongoing investigations, emerging threats, and enforcement strategies. They also offer various tools, resources, and training programs to help regulators combat securities fraud.

### Investor Education

NASAA emphasizes the importance of financial literacy as a means of investor protection. The association develops a wide range of educational resources, including online tools, brochures, seminars, and public awareness campaigns. These resources aim to equip investors with the knowledge they need to make informed decisions and recognize potential threats.

### Policy Advocacy

NASAA actively engages in policy advocacy to shape regulations that protect investors and enhance the integrity of the securities markets. This includes providing testimony before legislative bodies, contributing to public consultations, and publishing position papers. NASAA often collaborates with other financial regulators and industry stakeholders to drive forward key investor protection initiatives.

## Key Initiatives and Programs

### Model Rules and Regulations

NASAA develops model rules and regulations that its member jurisdictions can adopt to ensure a consistent regulatory approach across different states and countries. These model rules cover various aspects of securities regulation, including broker-dealer registration, investment adviser conduct, and disclosure requirements.

### Coordinated Examinations

Through its coordinated examination programs, NASAA helps state regulators conduct audits and inspections of financial firms. These examinations aim to ensure compliance with securities laws and identify any potential risks to investors early on. By pooling resources and expertise, NASAA enhances the effectiveness of these examinations.

### Cybersecurity Initiative

Recognizing the growing threat of cyber attacks on financial institutions, NASAA has launched a cybersecurity initiative to help regulators and firms safeguard sensitive information. This initiative includes issuing guidelines, conducting training sessions, and providing a platform for sharing best practices and threat intelligence.

### Senior Investor Protection Initiative

NASAA is particularly focused on protecting senior investors, a demographic that is often targeted by fraudsters. The Senior Investor Protection Initiative aims to educate seniors about common investment scams and provides tools for regulators to detect and prevent financial exploitation of older adults.

### Investor Education Programs

NASAA’s investor education programs cover a wide range of topics, including basic investing principles, understanding mutual funds and ETFs, retirement planning, and identifying fraud. These programs are delivered through workshops, webinars, online courses, and printed materials.

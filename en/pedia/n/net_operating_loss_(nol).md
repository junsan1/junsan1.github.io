# Net Operating Loss (NOL)

## Introduction
Net Operating Loss (NOL) is a tax term that refers to a situation where a company's allowable tax deductions exceed its [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md) within a particular tax period. In simple terms, it occurs when a company's expenses exceed its revenues, resulting in a negative [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md). NOL is an important concept for businesses, particularly those in volatile industries or startups that may experience periods of significant losses before achieving profitability. 

## Mechanics of NOL

### Calculation of NOL
The formula to calculate NOL might vary slightly depending on jurisdiction, but the fundamental concept remains consistent. Here's a simplified example:

\[ \text{NOL} = \text{Expenses} - \text{[Gross Income](../g/gross_income.md)} \]

It’s important to [note](../n/note.md) that not all deductions are allowed when calculating NOL. For instance, you cannot include certain [capital](../c/capital.md) losses, non-[business](../b/business.md) deductions, and some specific items as defined by [local tax](../l/local_tax.md) regulations.

### Use of NOL
Businesses can use NOL to reduce their [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md) in other years through two mechanisms:
1. **Carryforward**: This allows a [business](../b/business.md) to apply the NOL to future years’ incomes, reducing future tax liabilities.
2. **Carryback**: This permits a [business](../b/business.md) to apply the NOL to the taxable incomes of previous years, receiving refunds for [taxes](../t/taxes.md) already paid.

#### Carryforward
The TCJA (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) of 2017 introduced significant changes in how NOL carryforwards can be used. Under the TCJA, businesses can carry forward NOL indefinitely but are capped at offsetting only up to 80% of [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md) in any future year.

#### Carryback
The same act eliminated the ability to carry back NOLs, although temporary relief measures, such as the CARES Act, introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic, have reintroduced carryback for certain years.

## Importance in Financial Planning
Managers and financial planners also need to use NOL in corporate [forecasting](../f/forecasting.md) and [tax planning](../t/tax_planning.md). A well-strategized application of NOL can significantly impact a company's [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md), reported [earnings](../e/earnings.md), and overall [financial health](../f/financial_health.md).

## Practical Examples
### Example 1: Startup Company
Startups often incur substantial initial development costs. For instance, if a tech [startup](../s/startup.md) spends heavily on research and development, salaries, and [marketing](../m/marketing.md) but earns minimal [revenue](../r/revenue.md) in its early years, it [will](../w/will.md) likely report significant NOLs. When the [startup](../s/startup.md) eventually becomes profitable, these earlier NOLs can [offset](../o/offset.md) the [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md), reducing the tax [obligations](../o/obligation.md) in the profitable years.

### Example 2: Agriculture Business
A farming [business](../b/business.md) that has a bad harvest year and incurs high operational costs but earns low [revenue](../r/revenue.md) could report an NOL for that year. The [business](../b/business.md) could use the NOL to get a refund on [taxes](../t/taxes.md) paid on profitable years by carrying back the loss or use it to reduce tax burden in future [profit](../p/profit.md) years by carrying it forward.

## Tax Policies Across Different Jurisdictions
The treatment of NOL can differ significantly from one country to another. While the basic principles are somewhat consistent, specific rules on carrybacks and carryforwards, as well as the applicability to certain types of [income](../i/income.md), can vary.

### USA
The USA has well-defined rules for NOLs, particularly under the Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Code (IRC). The TCJA and CARES Act have introduced recent changes, but the fundamental mechanics remain: NOLs can be carried forward indefinitely, offsetting future [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md), subject to certain limitations.

### UK
In the UK, NOL rules are governed by HM [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) and Customs (HMRC). UK rules allow for both carryforward and carryback of losses, although specific limitations and qualifications may apply depending on the type of loss and the nature of the [business](../b/business.md).

### Canada
Canada's Canada [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Agency (CRA) allows for NOL beginning three years back (carryback) or up to 20 years forward. Understanding these jurisdictions' specifics is crucial for multinational companies navigating diverse tax landscapes.

## Impact on Valuation and Investment
Investors keenly scrutinize NOLs as they can materially affect a company's [valuation](../v/valuation.md). High NOLs indicate potential future tax shields, improving future profitability metrics. However, persistent NOLs may also signal [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [financial distress](../f/financial_distress.md) or suboptimal [operational efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md).

### Valuation Models
When adjusting Discounted [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md) (DCF) models, analysts may incorporate NOLs into [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) projections to derive more accurate valuations. NOLs can create deferred tax assets on the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md), which are considered in enterprise [value](../v/value.md) calculations and [equity](../e/equity.md) analyses.

## Conclusion
Net Operating Loss (NOL) is a crucial consideration in [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md), [tax planning](../t/tax_planning.md), and [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md). Understanding its calculation, applicability, and implications can [offer](../o/offer.md) significant advantages in optimizing a company's [financial health](../f/financial_health.md). חוקרים, מנהלים, ומשקיעים ארגוניים צריכים להיות ערוכים לנצל NOL לטובתם או להעריך את השפעותיו על הערך הארגוני.

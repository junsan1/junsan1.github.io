# Negative Income Tax (NIT)

A **Negative [Income Tax](../i/income_tax.md) (NIT)** is an economic concept and policy proposal primarily associated with [taxation](../t/taxation.md) and social [welfare](../w/welfare.md) systems. It was popularized by [economist](../e/economist.md) [Milton Friedman](../m/milton_friedman.md) in the 1960s as a means to simplify and improve the [welfare](../w/welfare.md) system and reduce [poverty](../p/poverty.md). Under a Negative [Income Tax](../i/income_tax.md), individuals earning below a certain threshold receive supplemental pay from the government, rather than paying [taxes](../t/taxes.md).

The central idea behind NIT is to provide a basic [income](../i/income.md) guarantee, ensuring that everyone receives a minimum level of [income](../i/income.md) regardless of their employment status. This policy aims to eradicate [poverty](../p/poverty.md), reduce [bureaucracy](../b/bureaucracy.md), and eliminate the disincentive to work often associated with traditional [welfare](../w/welfare.md) programs.

## Key Concepts and Principles

### 1. **Income Threshold**
The NIT system sets a specific [income](../i/income.md) level, referred to as the "break-even" point or threshold. Individuals earning below this level receive a supplement from the government, whereas those earning above it pay [taxes](../t/taxes.md) as usual. The purpose is to maintain a floor level of [income](../i/income.md) for all citizens.

### 2. **Tax and Transfer Mechanism**
The NIT operates through a tax and transfer mechanism. Instead of traditional [welfare](../w/welfare.md) programs that require extensive administrative overhead and specific eligibility requirements, NIT simplifies the process by automatically providing financial assistance based on [income tax](../i/income_tax.md) returns.

### 3. **Negative Tax Rates**
Negative tax rates are applied to individuals below the [income](../i/income.md) threshold. For example, if the break-even [income](../i/income.md) is $20,000 and an individual earns $10,000, a certain percentage of the [shortfall](../s/shortfall.md) (say 50%) is provided as a [subsidy](../s/subsidy.md). Therefore, the individual would receive an additional $5,000, bringing their total [income](../i/income.md) to $15,000.

### 4. **Phasing Out**
The amount provided as a negative [income tax](../i/income_tax.md) phases out as the individual’s [income](../i/income.md) increases. This ensures that the benefit decreases gradually rather than disappearing abruptly, avoiding a sudden loss of [income](../i/income.md) which can discourage work.

## Benefits of Negative Income Tax

### 1. **Reduction of Poverty**
NIT aims to lift individuals and families out of [poverty](../p/poverty.md) by ensuring they have a minimum [income](../i/income.md). This provides financial stability, allowing for better access to necessities such as housing, food, and healthcare.

### 2. **Administrative Efficiency**
Traditional [welfare](../w/welfare.md) systems often suffer from complexity and high administrative costs. NIT simplifies the [welfare](../w/welfare.md) system by integrating it with the tax system, reducing [bureaucracy](../b/bureaucracy.md) and administrative overhead.

### 3. **Incentive to Work**
NIT is designed to avoid the "[welfare](../w/welfare.md) trap" where individuals might be discouraged from seeking employment due to losing benefits. The gradual phase-out of benefits as [income](../i/income.md) increases ensures that working more always results in higher net [income](../i/income.md).

### 4. **Economic Stability**
By providing a stable [income](../i/income.md) floor, NIT could contribute to overall economic stability. It helps cushion the effects of economic downturns, ensuring that the most vulnerable populations maintain [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md), which in turn sustains [demand](../d/demand.md) for goods and services.

## Criticisms and Challenges

### 1. **Cost and Funding**
One of the primary criticisms of NIT is the potential high cost to the government. Funding a universal basic [income](../i/income.md) floor requires significant public expenditure, which could necessitate higher [taxes](../t/taxes.md) or reallocating funds from other areas.

### 2. **Potential for Inflation**
There's concern that providing a guaranteed [income](../i/income.md) could lead to [inflation](../i/inflation.md). As more [money](../m/money.md) circulates within the [economy](../e/economy.md) without a corresponding increase in goods and services, prices might rise, potentially negating the benefits of the additional [income](../i/income.md).

### 3. **Moral Hazard**
Critics argue that NIT might create a [moral hazard](../m/moral_hazard.md), where individuals could choose to rely on the guaranteed [income](../i/income.md) rather than seeking employment. However, advocates counter that the gradual reduction in benefits ensures that work is always financially advantageous.

### 4. **Implementation Complexity**
While NIT is conceptually simpler than traditional [welfare](../w/welfare.md) systems, implementing it on a national scale poses significant challenges. Transitioning from existing [welfare](../w/welfare.md) programs to an NIT system would require careful planning and coordination.

## Historical and Modern Applications

### 1. **Milton Friedman’s Proposal**
[Milton Friedman](../m/milton_friedman.md) argued for NIT as a means to simplify the [welfare state](../w/welfare_state.md) and create an efficient safety net. His proposal laid the groundwork for later discussions and experiments with basic [income](../i/income.md) systems.

### 2. **Experiments and Pilots**
Several countries have conducted experiments to test the efficacy of NIT:
- **United States:** The U.S. conducted several NIT experiments in the 1960s and 1970s, such as the New Jersey [Income](../i/income.md) Maintenance Experiment. Results were mixed but provided valuable data on labor [supply](../s/supply.md) responses and the effects on family stability.
- **Canada:** The Mincome experiment in Manitoba (1974-1979) tested a similar concept. Preliminary results suggested improvements in health and education outcomes, though labor [supply](../s/supply.md) effects were more modest.
- **Finland:** In recent years, Finland experimented with a basic [income](../i/income.md) pilot from 2017-2018. Though not exactly an NIT, it shared similar objectives of providing a guaranteed [income](../i/income.md) floor.

### 3. **Modern Discussions and Proposals**
In contemporary debates, NIT remains a relevant topic:
- **Universal Basic [Income](../i/income.md) (UBI):** NIT is often discussed alongside UBI, where all citizens receive a flat [income](../i/income.md) regardless of employment. UBI is more universal in nature compared to the means-tested NIT.
- **Advanced Economies:** Nations grappling with automation and job displacement consider NIT as a solution to provide financial [security](../s/security.md) amidst technological changes.

## Conclusion

Negative [Income Tax](../i/income_tax.md) represents a paradigm shift in addressing [poverty](../p/poverty.md) and [welfare](../w/welfare.md). It offers a potentially more efficient and equitable alternative to traditional [welfare](../w/welfare.md) programs. While challenges exist, particularly regarding cost and potential economic impacts, NIT continues to be an area of active [interest](../i/interest.md) and experimentation. Its focus on providing a safety net while maintaining work incentives makes it a compelling option for policymakers seeking to redesign [social security](../s/social_security.md) systems in the modern era.

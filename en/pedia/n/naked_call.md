# Naked Call

A naked call, also known as an uncovered call, is an [options](../o/options.md) [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) where the [trader](../t/trader.md) writes (sells) call [options](../o/options.md) without owning the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). This strategy allows the [trader](../t/trader.md) to collect premiums from the [sale](../s/sale.md) of the [options](../o/options.md) but exposes them to potentially [unlimited risk](../u/unlimited_risk.md), as the seller of the call must provide the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at the option's [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) if the buyer exercises the option. Naked calls are often used by advanced traders who believe that the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) [will](../w/will.md) not exceed the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) by the option's [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md), thereby allowing them to [profit](../p/profit.md) from the collected premiums without having to deliver the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

## Mechanism of a Naked Call

### Selling the Call Option

When a [trader](../t/trader.md) sells a [call option](../c/call_option.md), they are granting the buyer of the option the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at a predetermined [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) before the option expires. Naked call sellers do not [hold](../h/hold.md) any position in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md); hence, they are exposed to potential [liability](../l/liability.md) if the option is exercised.

### Premium Collection

The [trader](../t/trader.md) receives a [premium](../p/premium.md) upfront for selling the [call option](../c/call_option.md). This [premium](../p/premium.md) is the maximum [profit](../p/profit.md) the [trader](../t/trader.md) can achieve through the naked call strategy. The [premium](../p/premium.md) collected serves as compensation for the [risk](../r/risk.md) undertaken by the [trader](../t/trader.md) in the event the option holder decides to [exercise](../e/exercise.md) the option.

### Obligation to Deliver

If the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) rises above the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md), the option buyer may [exercise](../e/exercise.md) their right to buy the [asset](../a/asset.md) at the predetermined [strike price](../s/strike_price.md). The naked call seller then must provide the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), which they might need to purchase at the current higher [market price](../m/market_price.md) to fulfill their obligation, leading to potentially significant losses.

## Risks and Rewards

### Unlimited Risk

One of the most critical aspects of a naked call is the potential for unlimited loss. Unlike other [options](../o/options.md) strategies where [risk](../r/risk.md) is capped, a naked call position can lead to substantial losses as the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) can theoretically rise indefinitely. This [risk](../r/risk.md) makes naked calls suitable primarily for those with significant experience and a high tolerance for [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Limited Profit

The [profit](../p/profit.md) from a naked call is limited to the [premium](../p/premium.md) received upfront from selling the option. If the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price remains below the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md), the option expires worthless, and the [trader](../t/trader.md) retains the [premium](../p/premium.md). However, once the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price exceeds the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md), the [trader](../t/trader.md) may face substantial losses.

### Margin Requirements

Due to the high [risk](../r/risk.md) involved, brokers require naked call sellers to maintain substantial [margin](../m/margin.md) accounts. The [margin](../m/margin.md) requirement is a safeguard to ensure that the seller can meet potential [obligations](../o/obligation.md) if the [market](../m/market.md) moves against their position. These requirements can tie up a significant amount of the [trader](../t/trader.md)'s [capital](../c/capital.md).

## Hedging and Strategies to Manage Risk

### Covered Call

A [covered call](../c/covered_call.md) is an alternative to a naked call where the [trader](../t/trader.md) already owns the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). This strategy involves selling a [call option](../c/call_option.md) against a long position in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), thus providing a [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against potential losses. While it still limits the [profit](../p/profit.md) potential to the [premium](../p/premium.md) received and the difference between the purchase price of the [asset](../a/asset.md) and the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md), the [covered call](../c/covered_call.md) avoids the [unlimited risk](../u/unlimited_risk.md) associated with a naked call.

### Using Stop-Loss Orders

Traders can employ [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md) to mitigate the [risk](../r/risk.md) of a naked call. A [stop-loss order](../s/stop-loss_order.md) automatically closes the position when the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) reaches a predetermined level, thereby limiting potential losses. However, this approach can lead to the premature closing of positions during temporary price fluctuations.

### Spreads

[Option spreads](../o/option_spreads.md), such as vertical [spreads](../s/spreads.md), can also serve as a means to manage the high [risk](../r/risk.md) involved with naked calls. By combining different option positions, traders can limit their [risk](../r/risk.md) while still attempting to benefit from [market](../m/market.md) movements. For example, a [bear call spread](../b/bear_call_spread.md) involves selling a [call option](../c/call_option.md) at one [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) and buying another [call option](../c/call_option.md) at a higher [strike price](../s/strike_price.md), thus capping the potential loss.

## Real-world Examples and Case Studies

### Equity Markets

Naked calls are often traded in [equity](../e/equity.md) markets, where traders speculate on the price movements of individual [stocks](../s/stock.md). For example, during periods of high [volatility](../v/volatility.md) or expected [earnings announcements](../e/earnings_announcements.md), traders might sell naked calls under the assumption that the stock price [will](../w/will.md) not rise significantly.

### Index Options

Naked calls can also be used in [index options](../i/index_options.md) trading. [Index options](../i/index_options.md) are based on stock indices rather than individual [stocks](../s/stock.md), and their prices reflect broader [market](../m/market.md) movements. Traders might employ naked call strategies if they believe the overall [market](../m/market.md) [will](../w/will.md) remain stagnant or decline.

### Commodities and Futures

In the commodities and [futures](../f/futures.md) markets, naked calls can be used to take positions on the future prices of goods such as oil, gold, or agricultural products. The high [leverage](../l/leverage.md) available in these markets can amplify both the potential premiums collected and the risks faced by naked call sellers.

## Regulatory and Compliance Considerations

### SEC Regulations

In the United States, the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) imposes strict regulations on [options](../o/options.md) trading, including naked calls. Traders must meet specific qualifications and maintain sufficient [capital](../c/capital.md) and [margin](../m/margin.md) requirements. These regulations aim to protect investors and maintain [market](../m/market.md) integrity.

### Broker Requirements

Brokers have their own rules and requirements for clients who wish to [trade](../t/trade.md) naked calls. These requirements often include minimum account balances, experience levels, and [risk](../r/risk.md) [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) agreements. It is essential for traders to understand their [broker](../b/broker.md)'s policies and comply with all regulatory standards.

### Risk Disclosure Statements

Traders engaging in naked call strategies must be aware of and acknowledge the risks involved. Brokers typically require traders to sign [risk](../r/risk.md) [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) statements, ensuring they understand the potential for significant losses and the necessity of maintaining adequate [margin](../m/margin.md).

## Conclusion

Naked call [options](../o/options.md) represent a high-[risk](../r/risk.md), high-reward strategy suitable for experienced traders. While the [premium](../p/premium.md) collected from selling a naked call can provide immediate [income](../i/income.md), the potential for unlimited losses requires careful [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) and a deep understanding of the [market](../m/market.md). By utilizing [hedging strategies](../h/hedging_strategies.md), [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md), and [spreads](../s/spreads.md), traders can mitigate some of the inherent risks, though the need for adequate [capital](../c/capital.md) and adherence to regulatory standards remains paramount. Consequently, naked calls should be approached with caution, consideration, and a thoroughly developed trading plan.

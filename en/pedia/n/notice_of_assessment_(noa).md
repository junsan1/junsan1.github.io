# Notice of Assessment (NOA)

A Notice of Assessment (NOA) is a document issued by tax authorities, such as the Canada [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Agency (CRA) or the Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Service (IRS) in the United States, after an individual or [corporation](../c/corporation.md) files their [tax return](../t/tax_return.md). The NOA outlines the details of the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md)’s assessed [tax return](../t/tax_return.md), indicating whether they owe additional [taxes](../t/taxes.md), have a refundable [credit](../c/credit.md), or if their tax filing is as expected.

## Key Components of a Notice of Assessment

When a Notice of Assessment is issued, it typically contains the following information:
- **Tax Year**: The specific tax year that the assessment covers.
- **[Taxable Income](../t/taxable_income.md)**: The [income](../i/income.md) amount that has been assessed and considered taxable by the tax authority.
- **Tax Payable**: The total amount of tax that is due based on the assessment. This can be divided into federal and state [taxes](../t/taxes.md) where applicable.
- **Payments and Credits**: Any payments that the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) has already made, such as withholdings from wages, installment payments, or refundable credits.
- **Balance Owing or Refund**: The net result of the assessment, determining if the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) owes [money](../m/money.md) or [will](../w/will.md) receive a refund.
- **[Interest](../i/interest.md) and Penalties**: Any [interest](../i/interest.md) or penalties assessed for late filing, underpayment of [taxes](../t/taxes.md), or errors in the [tax return](../t/tax_return.md).
- **Adjustments and Corrections**: Any changes made to the initial [tax return](../t/tax_return.md) that affect the final calculation of [taxes](../t/taxes.md) owed.

## Importance of a Notice of Assessment

The NOA serves several critical purposes:
1. **Verification**: It verifies the submission and processing of the [tax return](../t/tax_return.md).
2. **Finalization**: It finalizes the [tax return](../t/tax_return.md), providing the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) with the official determination of their tax [obligations](../o/obligation.md) or entitlements.
3. **Dispute Grounds**: It supplies taxpayers with the necessary information to dispute or appeal if they disagree with the assessment.
4. **[Financial Planning](../f/financial_planning.md)**: It aids in [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md), helping taxpayers understand their financial [obligations](../o/obligation.md) for the tax year reviewed.
5. **[Credit](../c/credit.md) and [Loan](../l/loan.md) Applications**: Financial institutions often require an NOA to verify [income](../i/income.md) and tax status during [credit](../c/credit.md) or [loan](../l/loan.md) application processes.

## Responding to a Notice of Assessment

Upon receiving an NOA, taxpayers should:
- **Review It Carefully**: Verify all the information for accuracy and completeness.
- **Compare With Filed [Return](../r/return.md)**: Ensure the details match the information submitted.
- **Address Corrections**: If discrepancies are found, contact the tax authority to resolve them.
- **Make Payments or Await Refund**: If a balance is owed, make the [payment](../p/payment.md) by the due date to avoid additional [interest](../i/interest.md) or penalties. If a refund is due, wait for the processing period.

## Example of NOA from Canada Revenue Agency

For Canadians, the CRA issues the NOA. It includes a detailed summary of [income](../i/income.md), deductions, credits, and the corresponding tax calculations. More information can be found on the CRA's official website: [Canada Revenue Agency - NOA](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-notice-assessment.html).

## Example of NOA from the Internal Revenue Service

In the United States, the IRS sends out NOAs following the annual tax submission. The IRS provides details on how to read and understand different types of notices, ensuring taxpayers navigate the process effectively. For additional resources, the IRS website offers comprehensive guidelines: [Internal Revenue Service - Understanding Your IRS Notice](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/understanding-your-irs-notice).

## Conclusion

A Notice of Assessment is a vital document that confirms the tax authority's assessment of a [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md)’s [return](../r/return.md). It holds significant financial implications, providing the final word on a [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md)’s [obligations](../o/obligation.md) or overpayments for the tax year. Always ensure careful comprehension and prompt action to remain in compliance with tax authorities and maintain sound [financial health](../f/financial_health.md).

# NYSE Composite Index

The NYSE Composite [Index](../i/index.md) is a stock [market index](../m/market_index.md) that tracks the performance of all common [stocks](../s/stock.md) [listed](../l/listed.md) on the New York Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (NYSE). It is considered one of the broadest and most inclusive indexes in the U.S. [equity](../e/equity.md) markets, representing the performance of a diverse array of industries and sectors that make up the NYSE. The [index](../i/index.md) is calculated using a [market](../m/market.md)-[capitalization](../c/capitalization.md)-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) methodology, meaning larger companies have a greater influence on the [index](../i/index.md)'s performance than smaller ones.

## Introduction
The NYSE Composite [Index](../i/index.md) includes over 1,900 [stocks](../s/stock.md), including both U.S. and international companies. It is a vital [indicator](../i/indicator.md) for gauging the overall health of the equities traded on the NYSE. With its creation dating back to the early 1960s, this [index](../i/index.md) offers a long-term perspective on [market](../m/market.md) trends and serves as a comprehensive [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for investors and analysts.

## Calculation Methodology
The NYSE Composite [Index](../i/index.md) uses a [market](../m/market.md)-[capitalization](../c/capitalization.md)-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) calculation, making it sensitive to the fluctuations in the [market](../m/market.md) values of the larger companies [listed](../l/listed.md) on the NYSE. Unlike price-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) indexes like the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a [market](../m/market.md)-cap-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) [index](../i/index.md) gives proportionately more weight to companies with larger [market](../m/market.md) capitalizations.

### Formula
The formula for the NYSE Composite [Index](../i/index.md) is as follows:

\[ \text{Index Level} = \left( \frac{\sum(\text{[Market](../m/market.md) Cap of All Components})}{\text{Divisor}} \right) \]

### Market Cap Calculation
- **[Market Capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md)**: It is calculated as the share price multiplied by the number of outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md) for each company.
- **Divisor**: A proprietary figure that adjusts for stock splits, spinoffs, and other corporate actions to maintain [index](../i/index.md) continuity.

## Components
The NYSE Composite [Index](../i/index.md) encompasses a comprehensive [range](../r/range.md) of sectors, including but not limited to:
- Financials
- Healthcare
- Information Technology
- Consumer Discretionary
- Industrials
- Energy

The components are reviewed periodically to ensure they remain representative of the broader [market](../m/market.md).

## Historical Performance
Over its long history, the NYSE Composite [Index](../i/index.md) has experienced several [bull](../b/bull.md) and bear [market cycles](../m/market_cycles.md), reflecting broader [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md). Notably, it provides historical data that is invaluable for [trend analysis](../t/trend_analysis.md) and investment strategies.

## Importance for Investors
### Diversification
By including a [wide variety](../w/wide_variety.md) of industries and companies of different sizes, the NYSE Composite [Index](../i/index.md) offers a diversified portfolio that mitigates risks associated with individual sectors or [stocks](../s/stock.md).

### Benchmarking
Investors and [fund](../f/fund.md) managers often use the NYSE Composite [Index](../i/index.md) as a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) to compare the performance of their own portfolios. This helps in assessing whether specific investments are outperforming or underperforming the broader [market](../m/market.md).

### Market Sentiment
The [index](../i/index.md) serves as a barometer for [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md). Because it includes a large number of [stocks](../s/stock.md), its performance can provide insights into general [investor](../i/investor.md) confidence and economic health.

## ETFs and Mutual Funds
Several [Exchange](../e/exchange.md)-Traded Funds (ETFs) and mutual funds aim to replicate the performance of the NYSE Composite [Index](../i/index.md). These financial products [offer](../o/offer.md) investors an easy way to [gain](../g/gain.md) exposure to the broad [market](../m/market.md) without needing to invest in each component individually.

# Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation (NQDC)

Non-Qualified [Deferred Compensation](../d/deferred_compensation.md) (NQDC) plans are contractual agreements under which an employee agrees to defer receipt of a portion of their compensation until a specified future date. Unlike qualified plans, such as 401(k)s which must adhere to ERISA (Employee Retirement [Income](../i/income.md) [Security](../s/security.md) Act) regulations and IRS limits, NQDC plans do not have to meet these stringent rules. Consequently, they are often utilized by high-earning executives and highly compensated employees.

## Basic Concepts

NQDC plans allow employees to delay [income](../i/income.md) [taxation](../t/taxation.md) on portions of their [earnings](../e/earnings.md) until the funds are actually paid out. This can provide a number of strategic financial and [tax planning](../t/tax_planning.md) advantages for both the employee and the employer:

- **Employee Advantages:**
  - **Tax Deferral:** Employees defer tax on compensation until it is received in the future, potentially when they may be in a lower tax bracket.
  - **Customized Deferral [Options](../o/options.md):** Plans can be tailored to meet the specific [deferred compensation](../d/deferred_compensation.md) needs of employees.
  - **Investment Flexibility:** Some plans allow the deferred amounts to be invested, potentially providing substantial gains.

- **Employer Advantages:**
  - **Attract and Retain Talent:** NQDC plans can be a pivotal [factor](../f/factor.md) in attracting and retaining top-tier talent, particularly in competitive industries.
  - **Customization:** NQDC plans can be designed to meet diverse needs without the constraints that are applicable to qualified plans.

## Types of NQDC Plans

NQDC plans come in various forms, each with its own set of rules, benefits, and disadvantages:

### Salary Reduction Arrangements

- **Advance Arrangements:** Employees agree to defer a portion of their salary pre-tax, to be paid at a future date.
- **Investments:** These funds are often invested in selections that mimic the companyâ€™s 401(k) offerings or other specified investment vehicles.

### Bonus Deferral Plans

- **Mature Arrangements:** Executives and other high-earners may elect to defer bonus [earnings](../e/earnings.md), delaying tax liabilities.
- **Long-term Incentives:** This allows employees to tie the bonus to future company performance.

### Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans (SERPs)

- **Company-funded:** Offers additional retirement benefits beyond the qualified plan limits.
- **Retention Tool:** Often partially vested over time to encourage long-term employment.

### Excess Benefit Plans

- **Compensation Limit [Surplus](../s/surplus.md):** Designed to provide benefits beyond what is permissible under qualified plans.
- **Dollar Limit Exceeding Contributions:** Relevant for employees who would otherwise exceed the defined contribution or benefit limits.

## Key Considerations

### Tax Treatment

- **[Income Tax](../i/income_tax.md):** [Deferred compensation](../d/deferred_compensation.md) is not taxed until it is received.
- **[Payroll](../p/payroll.md) [Taxes](../t/taxes.md):** [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) and Medicare [taxes](../t/taxes.md) are due when the [income](../i/income.md) is earned, not when it is paid.
- **Section 409A Compliance:** Adherence to IRS rules is essential to avoid tax penalties.

### Risk and Investment Options

- **Company [Solvency](../s/solvency.md) [Risk](../r/risk.md):** Funds deferred are typically unsecured [obligations](../o/obligation.md) of the company; if the company faces [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md), these funds could be at [risk](../r/risk.md).
- **Investment [Options](../o/options.md):** Depending on the plan, employees may have a variety of investment choices, or the employer may predetermine these.

### Timing and Distribution

- **Specified [Payment](../p/payment.md) Dates:** Payouts usually occur at retirement, termination, or other specified times.
- **Hardship Withdrawals:** Plans may allow for early [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) under specific and severe circumstances.

## Creating and Managing NQDC Plans

Setting up an NQDC plan involves [multiple](../m/multiple.md) steps and crucial managerial decisions:

### Plan Design

- **Customization:** The plan should meet the unique requirements of both the employee and the employer.
- **Flexibility:** Should provide [options](../o/options.md) for changes based on life events and [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md).

### Funding and Investments

- **[Rabbi Trust](../r/rabbi_trust.md):** Employers often use a [rabbi trust](../r/rabbi_trust.md) to [hold](../h/hold.md) deferred amounts, [offering](../o/offering.md) some protection against company [insolvency](../i/insolvency.md).
- **Investment Diversity:** [Offering](../o/offering.md) a [range](../r/range.md) of investment [options](../o/options.md) similar to a 401(k) helps employees grow their deferred [earnings](../e/earnings.md).

### Legal and Compliance

- **Section 409A:** Ensures the plan complies with deferral elections, distributions, and funding rules to avoid penalties.
- **ERISA Exemptions:** NQDC plans are generally exempt from ERISA, simplifying compliance.

### Employee Communication

- **Clear Explanations:** Provide detailed explanations about plan benefits, risks, and tax implications.
- **Annual Reviews:** Regular updates [on account](../o/on_account.md) performance, changes in tax law, and other relevant information.

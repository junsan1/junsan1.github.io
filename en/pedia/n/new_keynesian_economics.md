# New Keynesian Economics

New [Keynesian Economics](../k/keynesian_economics_in_trading.md) is a modern macroeconomic school that strives to develop and extend the principles established by [John Maynard Keynes](../j/john_maynard_keynes.md) in his seminal work "The General Theory of Employment, [Interest](../i/interest.md), and [Money](../m/money.md)" published in 1936. Unlike classical [Keynesian economics](../k/keynesian_economics_in_trading.md), which focused primarily on short-run deviations from [full employment](../f/full_employment.md) caused by ineffective [aggregate demand](../a/aggregate_demand.md), New [Keynesian Economics](../k/keynesian_economics_in_trading.md) incorporates microeconomic foundations to explain how [market](../m/market.md) imperfections and other dynamic factors can lead to persistent [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) and [inflation](../i/inflation.md) in the [economy](../e/economy.md).

## 1. The Foundational Principles of New Keynesian Economics

### 1.1 Microeconomic Rigor

The unique strength of New [Keynesian Economics](../k/keynesian_economics_in_trading.md) lies in its rigorous microeconomic foundation. This approach incorporates individual behavior to explain aggregate economic phenomena, allowing for a more detailed and nuanced understanding of economic issues.

### 1.2 Sticky Prices and Wages

One of the central tenets of New [Keynesian Economics](../k/keynesian_economics_in_trading.md) is that prices and wages are "sticky," meaning they adjust slowly in response to changes in [supply](../s/supply.md) and [demand](../d/demand.md). This stickiness can result in markets not [clearing](../c/clearing.md) instantly, leading to periods of [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) or [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

#### 1.2.1 Menu Costs

The concept of [menu costs](../m/menu_costs.md)—costs that firms incur when changing prices—offers an explanation for [price stickiness](../p/price_stickiness.md). If the cost of changing prices outweighs the potential benefits, firms may opt to keep prices constant, even if [market](../m/market.md) conditions fluctuate.

#### 1.2.2 Wage Contracts

Wage stickiness is often explained through long-term contracts between employers and employees. Multi-period contracts and [negotiation](../n/negotiation.md) processes can delay wage adjustments, contributing to [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) and [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

## 2. Market Imperfections

### 2.1 Imperfect Competition

New Keynesian models frequently assume that markets are not perfectly competitive. Firms often have some degree of [market power](../m/market_power.md), which allows them to set prices above marginal cost. This [market](../m/market.md) imperfection can result in less-than-optimal allocation of resources.

### 2.2 Information Asymmetry

Information asymmetry between buyers and sellers can exacerbate [market](../m/market.md) inefficiencies. For instance, if workers do not have perfect information about job opportunities, they may remain unemployed longer than they should.

## 3. Policy Implications

New [Keynesian Economics](../k/keynesian_economics_in_trading.md) has significant implications for economic policy, particularly in the realms of fiscal and [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md).

### 3.1 Fiscal Policy

Given that prices and wages are sticky, Keynesian economists argue that government intervention through [fiscal policy](../f/fiscal_policy.md) can play a crucial role in stabilizing the [economy](../e/economy.md). [Aggregate demand](../a/aggregate_demand.md) management, through government spending and [taxation](../t/taxation.md), can help mitigate the effects of [economic cycles](../e/economic_cycles.md).

#### 3.1.1 Government Spending

In times of economic downturns, governments can increase spending to boost [aggregate demand](../a/aggregate_demand.md). This intervention can help [offset](../o/offset.md) reduced [private sector](../p/private_sector.md) activity, mitigating the [recession](../r/recession.md)'s impact.

#### 3.1.2 Taxation

Adjusting tax rates is another tool for managing [aggregate demand](../a/aggregate_demand.md). Lowering [taxes](../t/taxes.md) can increase [disposable income](../d/disposable_income.md) and stimulate consumption and investment.

### 3.2 Monetary Policy

New Keynesian models advocate for active [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) as another mechanism for economic stabilization.

#### 3.2.1 Interest Rates

By altering [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, central banks can influence borrowing and spending. Lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates make borrowing cheaper, encouraging investment and consumption, while higher rates can constrain these activities to control [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

#### 3.2.2 Inflation Targeting

Central banks often set explicit [inflation](../i/inflation.md) targets to anchor expectations. This practice also contributes to long-term price stability, an essential goal of [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md).

## 4. New Keynesian DSGE Models

One of the most sophisticated tools developed within the New Keynesian framework is the Dynamic Stochastic General [Equilibrium](../e/equilibrium.md) (DSGE) model. These models incorporate microeconomic foundations, including household [utility maximization](../u/utility_maximization.md) and [firm](../f/firm.md) [profit](../p/profit.md) maximization, to simulate how economic shocks propagate through the [economy](../e/economy.md).

### 4.1 Rational Expectations

DSGE models often assume that agents have rational expectations, meaning they make decisions based on all available information and an accurate understanding of the economic structure.

### 4.2 Policy Influence

DSGE models are crucial for policy analysis. They allow economists to run counterfactual experiments, comparing what would happen under different policy scenarios, and thus provide [guidance](../g/guidance.md) for optimal policy design.

## 5. Relationship with Other Theories

### 5.1 Classical Economics

New [Keynesian Economics](../k/keynesian_economics_in_trading.md) contrasts with [classical economics](../c/classical_economics.md) by assuming [market](../m/market.md) imperfections. While classical economists argue for self-correcting markets, New Keynesians believe active government intervention is often necessary.

### 5.2 Monetarism

Monetarists, like New Keynesians, recognize the importance of [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) but argue that controlling [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) is the most effective way to stabilize the [economy](../e/economy.md). In contrast, New Keynesians focus on managing [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and [inflation](../i/inflation.md) expectations.

### 5.3 New Classical Economics

New [Classical Economics](../c/classical_economics.md), which emphasizes rational expectations and [market](../m/market.md)-[clearing](../c/clearing.md) models, has significantly influenced New Keynesian thought. Where they diverge is on the [issue](../i/issue.md) of price and wage stickiness, with New Keynesians arguing these rigidities can justify government intervention.

## 6. Criticisms and Debates

New [Keynesian Economics](../k/keynesian_economics_in_trading.md) is not without its critics. Some argue that its models are overly complex and rest on unrealistic assumptions. Critics from the Austrian school, for example, argue that focusing on [aggregate demand](../a/aggregate_demand.md) neglects the importance of the [supply](../s/supply.md) side of the [economy](../e/economy.md).

### 6.1 Methodological Critiques

Methodological critiques often highlight the assumptions of rational expectations and representative agents. Critics argue these assumptions oversimplify the complexity of human behavior and overlook heterogeneity among economic agents.

### 6.2 Policy Effectiveness

Debates also arise over the effectiveness of Keynesian policy prescriptions. Some argue that fiscal stimuli can lead to crowding out, where increased government spending displaces [private sector](../p/private_sector.md) investment.

## Conclusion

New [Keynesian Economics](../k/keynesian_economics_in_trading.md) remains a dominant paradigm in modern [macroeconomics](../m/macroeconomics.md), blending rigorous microeconomic foundations with Keynesian principles of [aggregate demand](../a/aggregate_demand.md) management. It provides powerful tools for understanding economic fluctuations and designing policy responses. Even with its criticisms and challenges, New [Keynesian Economics](../k/keynesian_economics_in_trading.md) continues to evolve, contributing valuable insights to both academic research and practical policymaking.

# Non-Renounceable Rights

Non-renounceable rights are a crucial concept in the world of [finance](../f/finance.md) and are particularly relevant in [equity](../e/equity.md) markets. They represent a subset of rights issues where shareholders are given the opportunity to buy additional [shares](../s/shares.md) in a company, but these rights cannot be sold or transferred to another party. Understanding the mechanics, advantages, and disadvantages of non-renounceable rights is essential for investors, as well as for companies looking to raise additional [capital](../c/capital.md).

## Definitions and Basic Concepts

### Rights Issue
A rights [issue](../i/issue.md) is a method used by companies to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) by giving existing shareholders the right to purchase additional [shares](../s/shares.md) directly from the company, usually at a [discount](../d/discount.md) to the current [market price](../m/market_price.md). Rights issues are common when a company needs to raise [money](../m/money.md) for various purposes such as [expansion](../e/expansion.md), [debt](../d/debt.md) [repayment](../r/repayment.md), or other [capital](../c/capital.md) expenditures.

### Non-Renounceable Rights
Non-renounceable rights differ from renounceable rights in that they cannot be traded on the stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md) or transferred to another party. If a [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) does not [exercise](../e/exercise.md) these non-renounceable rights within the stipulated period, they [will](../w/will.md) [lapse](../l/lapse.md), and the [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) [will](../w/will.md) not benefit from the opportunity to purchase additional [shares](../s/shares.md) at a discounted rate.

### Renounceable vs. Non-Renounceable
Renounceable rights can be sold or transferred, providing flexibility to shareholders who may not wish to increase their stake in the company. Non-renounceable rights, on the other hand, must be either exercised or allowed to [lapse](../l/lapse.md), limiting the [options](../o/options.md) available to shareholders.

## Mechanism of Non-Renounceable Rights

### Issue of Rights
1. **Proposal:** The company announces a non-renounceable rights [issue](../i/issue.md) and provides details including the number of new [shares](../s/shares.md) available, the [discount](../d/discount.md) offered, and the time frame for exercising the rights.
2. **[Record Date](../r/record_date.md):** The company sets a [record date](../r/record_date.md) to determine which shareholders are eligible to receive the non-renounceable rights.
3. **Rights Allocation:** Eligible shareholders are issued rights, usually one right for each existing share they [hold](../h/hold.md).

### Subscription
1. **Subscription Period:** Shareholders have a specified period to decide whether to [exercise](../e/exercise.md) their rights and purchase additional [shares](../s/shares.md).
2. **[Exercise Price](../e/excersise_price.md):** The price at which shareholders can purchase the additional [shares](../s/shares.md) is typically set below the current [market price](../m/market_price.md), providing an incentive to participate.
3. **Application Form:** Shareholders wishing to [exercise](../e/exercise.md) their rights need to complete an application form and pay for the [shares](../s/shares.md).

### Lapse of Rights
If shareholders do not act within the given time frame, the non-renounceable rights [lapse](../l/lapse.md), and they lose the opportunity to buy additional [shares](../s/shares.md) at the discounted price.

## Advantages of Non-Renounceable Rights

### For Companies
1. **Quick [Capital](../c/capital.md):** Non-renounceable rights provide a relatively quick and efficient method for companies to raise [capital](../c/capital.md).
2. **Guaranteed Participation:** Since the rights cannot be sold, the company ensures that only committed shareholders participate, potentially stabilizing the [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) base.
3. **Lower [Marketing](../m/marketing.md) Costs:** With non-renounceable rights, the costs associated with [marketing](../m/marketing.md) and selling the rights are reduced, as there is no need to facilitate the trading of rights.

### For Shareholders
1. **Discounted Price:** Shareholders get the opportunity to buy additional [shares](../s/shares.md) at a discounted price, increasing their stake in the company at a favorable rate.
2. **No [Dilution](../d/dilution.md):** Existing shareholders can maintain their proportional ownership in the company by exercising their rights, avoiding [dilution](../d/dilution.md) of their [holdings](../h/holdings.md).

## Disadvantages of Non-Renounceable Rights

### For Companies
1. **Lower Participation:** The non-tradeable nature of non-renounceable rights might result in lower participation, as shareholders who do not wish to or cannot afford to invest more may simply let their rights [lapse](../l/lapse.md).
2. **Limited Flexibility:** Non-renounceable rights [offer](../o/offer.md) less flexibility in terms of attracting new investors compared to other [capital](../c/capital.md)-raising methods.

### For Shareholders
1. **[Capital](../c/capital.md) Requirement:** Existing shareholders need to have the necessary [capital](../c/capital.md) to [exercise](../e/exercise.md) their rights if they want to avoid [dilution](../d/dilution.md).
2. **No [Market Value](../m/market_value.md):** Since the rights cannot be sold, their [value](../v/value.md) is essentially zero if the [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) decides not to [exercise](../e/exercise.md) them, unlike renounceable rights which can still fetch a [market price](../m/market_price.md).

## Case Studies

### CSL Limited
CSL Limited, a biopharmaceutical company, conducted a non-renounceable rights [issue](../i/issue.md) to [fund](../f/fund.md) its [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) of another company. Shareholders were offered one new share for every 14 existing [shares](../s/shares.md) held, providing a [discount](../d/discount.md) to encourage participation.

### STAR Entertainment Group
STAR Entertainment Group used a non-renounceable rights [issue](../i/issue.md) to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) following the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Shareholders were given the opportunity to buy new [shares](../s/shares.md) at a [discount](../d/discount.md), aiming to secure the companyâ€™s financial stability.

## Comparison with Other Capital-Raising Methods

### Traditional Rights Issues
Renounceable rights issues [offer](../o/offer.md) more flexibility to shareholders as they can sell their rights if they choose not to purchase additional [shares](../s/shares.md). However, they can be more complex and costlier for the company to manage due to the need for listing and trading of these rights.

### Private Placements
Private placements involve selling [shares](../s/shares.md) to a select group of investors rather than the general public. While quicker and often less costly, this method can dilute existing shareholders' stakes if they are not included in the [offer](../o/offer.md).

### Public Offerings
Public offerings can attract a broad [range](../r/range.md) of investors but are typically more complex and expensive due to regulatory requirements and [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) fees. Unlike rights issues, they do not prioritize existing shareholders.

## Conclusion

Non-renounceable rights are a specific form of rights [issue](../i/issue.md) that provide existing shareholders with the opportunity to purchase additional [shares](../s/shares.md) directly from the company at a discounted price. While they [offer](../o/offer.md) several advantages such as quick [capital](../c/capital.md) raising and reduced [marketing](../m/marketing.md) costs, they also have limitations including the requirement for shareholders to have available [capital](../c/capital.md) and the lack of flexibility as the rights cannot be sold. Both companies and shareholders must carefully consider these factors when contemplating non-renounceable rights as a method for [capital](../c/capital.md) formation or investment.

By understanding the nuances and implications of non-renounceable rights, investors and companies can make informed decisions that align with their financial strategies and goals.

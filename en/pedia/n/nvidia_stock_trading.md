## Algotrading for NVIDIA Stocks

### What is Algorithmic Trading?

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) refers to using computer algorithms to trade stocks and other financial instruments automatically. These algorithms make decisions based on pre-programmed criteria, such as timing, price, and complex mathematical models and [historical data analysis](../h/historical_data_analysis.md). Algotrading can execute trades at speeds and frequencies far beyond human capability, which can be advantageous in a highly competitive market.

### Advantages of Algotrading with NVIDIA Stocks

1. **Speed and Efficiency**: Algorithms can execute trades within milliseconds, capturing opportunities quicker than human traders.
2. **Eliminating Human Error**: Automated trading removes emotional biases and irrational decision-making from [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).
3. **[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md)**: Algorithms can be backtested using historical data to determine their potential profitability and risk.
4. **[Market Timing](../m/market_timing.md)**: Algorithms can analyze large datasets to predict optimal entry and exit points in the market.

### Common Algorithms Used

1. **[Mean Reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md)**: Assumes that the stock price will return to an average level over time. If NVIDIA's stock price deviates significantly from its historical average, the algorithm will trade based on the expectation that it will revert.
2. **[Momentum Trading](../m/momentum_trading.md)**: Identifies stocks on significant upward or downward trends, predicting that the stock's trajectory will continue.
3. **Statistical [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**: Utilizes mathematical models to identify price discrepancies between securities—for instance, between NVIDIA and similar technology stocks.
4. **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Leverage AI and machine learning to identify patterns and make trading decisions. These can include various models like neural networks, [decision trees](../d/decision_trees.md), and support vector machines.

## Historical Performance of NVIDIA Stock

### Price History and Key Milestones

- **1999**: NVIDIA goes public and begins to establish itself as a key player in the GPU market.

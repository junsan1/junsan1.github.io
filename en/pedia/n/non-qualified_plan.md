# Non-Qualified Plan

A Non-Qualified Plan is a type of retirement savings plan that falls outside the [scope](../s/scope.md) of the Employee Retirement [Income](../i/income.md) [Security](../s/security.md) Act (ERISA), meaning it does not qualify for the same tax benefits and regulations as Qualified Plans like 401(k)s and IRAs. These plans are generally used by employers to provide additional, often more flexible, benefits to a select group of employees, usually executives or highly compensated employees.

Non-Qualified Plans also provide an alternative for employees who have already maxed out their contributions to Qualified Plans and are looking for additional ways to defer [income](../i/income.md) to a later date. Unlike Qualified Plans, Non-Qualified Plans do not have contribution limits set by the IRS, allowing for greater flexibility in compensation arrangements.

## Types of Non-Qualified Plans

There are several types of Non-Qualified Plans, each designed to meet specific [business](../b/business.md) and employee needs. The most common types include:

### Deferred Compensation Plans

[Deferred Compensation](../d/deferred_compensation.md) Plans allow employees to defer a portion of their [income](../i/income.md) to a later date, thereby reducing their [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md) in the current year. The deferred [income](../i/income.md) grows [tax-deferred](../t/tax_deferred.md) until it is distributed, usually at retirement or upon [termination of employment](../t/termination_of_employment.md).

### Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans (SERPs)

SERPs are designed to provide additional retirement benefits to executives and key employees. These plans are funded by the employer and are usually offered as a supplement to Qualified Plans. The benefits are typically based on a percentage of the employee's salary and years of service.

### Executive Bonus Plans

Executive Bonus Plans involve the employer providing additional compensation to key employees in the form of bonuses. These bonuses can be used to purchase [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) or other investment products. The employee owns the policy and can access its cash [value](../v/value.md) at any time.

### 409A Plans

Named after Section 409A of the Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Code, these plans impose specific requirements on non-qualified [deferred compensation](../d/deferred_compensation.md) to avoid immediate [taxation](../t/taxation.md). Failure to comply with 409A regulations can result in substantial penalties for employees.

## Tax Implications

Non-Qualified Plans have different tax implications compared to Qualified Plans:

- **Employer Contributions:** Contributions made by the employer are not immediately tax-deductible. They become deductible when the employee receives the benefit.
- **Employee Deferrals:** Employee deferrals are not subject to [income tax](../i/income_tax.md) until they are distributed. However, they may be subject to [payroll](../p/payroll.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) at the time of deferral.
- **Distributions:** Distributions from Non-Qualified Plans are taxed as [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md) when received by the employee.

## Compliance and Legal Considerations

Non-Qualified Plans are not subject to the same stringent regulations as Qualified Plans, but they must still comply with various federal and state laws. Key compliance issues include:

- **Section 409A Compliance:** Plans must meet specific requirements regarding the timing of deferrals and distributions to avoid penalties.
- **Top-Hat Plans:** These plans are exempt from certain ERISA requirements but must still provide the Department of Labor with specific information about the plan.
- **Funding Methods:** Non-Qualified Plans can be either funded or unfunded. Funded plans involve setting aside assets in a [trust](../t/trust.md), while unfunded plans involve a mere promise by the employer to pay benefits in the future.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

- **Flexibility:** Non-Qualified Plans [offer](../o/offer.md) greater flexibility in plan design and funding methods.
- **Customization:** Plans can be tailored to meet the specific needs of the [business](../b/business.md) and its key employees.
- **No Contribution Limits:** Unlike Qualified Plans, Non-Qualified Plans do not have IRS-imposed contribution limits.
- **Deferred [Taxation](../t/taxation.md):** [Income](../i/income.md) is taxed when received, allowing for potential tax savings.

### Disadvantages

- **[Risk](../r/risk.md):** Employees face the [risk](../r/risk.md) of the employer's financial instability, as benefits are often unsecured.
- **Lack of Portability:** Non-Qualified Plans are typically not portable, meaning they cannot be rolled over into other retirement accounts.
- **[Payroll](../p/payroll.md) [Taxes](../t/taxes.md):** Employee deferrals may be subject to [payroll](../p/payroll.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) at the time of deferral.
- **Limited Participation:** These plans are usually restricted to key employees and are not available to all employees.

## Common Uses

Non-Qualified Plans are commonly used in the following scenarios:

- **Attracting and Retaining Talent:** Businesses use these plans to attract and retain key employees by [offering](../o/offering.md) enhanced retirement benefits.
- **Supplementing Qualified Plans:** They provide additional retirement benefits for employees who have maxed out their contributions to Qualified Plans.
- **[Golden Handcuffs](../g/golden_handcuffs.md):** These plans can create incentives for employees to stay with the company by providing substantial benefits that are only accessible after a certain period or upon reaching specific milestones.

## Conclusion

Non-Qualified Plans are valuable tools for businesses looking to [offer](../o/offer.md) additional retirement benefits to a select group of employees. They provide flexibility, customization, and the potential for significant tax advantages. However, they also come with risks and regulatory considerations that must be carefully managed to ensure compliance and the long-term viability of the plan.

# Normal-Course Issuer Bid (NCIB)

A Normal-Course [Issuer](../i/issuer.md) [Bid](../b/bid.md), commonly abbreviated as NCIB, is a corporate action whereby a publicly traded company repurchases its own outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md) from the existing shareholders, usually through the [open market](../o/open_market.md). This mechanism is a form of share [buyback](../b/buyback.md) program that Canadian companies often employ but can also be used by businesses in other jurisdictions under different terms and regulations. 

## Overview

Share repurchases via NCIBs are a key aspect of [capital](../c/capital.md) management for [listed](../l/listed.md) companies. These buybacks are generally initiated when the company's management believes that its [shares](../s/shares.md) are [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md), thus representing a good investment. By repurchasing [shares](../s/shares.md), companies aim to reduce the number of outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md), thereby potentially increasing [earnings](../e/earnings.md) per share (EPS) and boosting share price. 

NCIBs are typically conducted over a set period, often up to a year, and companies are required to adhere to specific rules and regulations set forth by securities regulators to ensure [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and fair treatment of all shareholders. While not obligatory, announcements and disclosures regarding NCIBs are standard practice to maintain [investor](../i/investor.md) confidence and compliance with regulations.

## Mechanism and Process

1. **Board Approval**: The process begins with the company's board of directors approving the share [buyback](../b/buyback.md) program. This decision is based on various factors, including [market](../m/market.md) conditions, the company's [financial health](../f/financial_health.md), and strategic goals.

2. **Public Announcement**: Once approved, the company typically makes a public announcement regarding the NCIB, detailing the maximum number of [shares](../s/shares.md) to be repurchased, the time frame, and the methods to be employed in acquiring the [shares](../s/shares.md).

3. **Regulatory Filing**: In the Canadian context, the company must file a notice of intention with the relevant securities regulatory authorities, such as the Toronto Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (TSX). This notice includes specific information about the NCIB and ensures regulatory compliance.

4. **[Execution](../e/execution.md)**: The actual repurchase of [shares](../s/shares.md) is conducted over the specified period. This is usually done through the [open market](../o/open_market.md), although private negotiations and other methods may be employed according to the regulatory framework.

5. **Reporting**: Companies are typically required to report the progress of the NCIB regularly, detailing the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) repurchased, the average price paid, and the remaining [shares](../s/shares.md) authorized for repurchase.

6. **Cancellation of [Shares](../s/shares.md)**: Repurchased [shares](../s/shares.md) are generally canceled, reducing the total number of outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md). Alternatively, they may be held as treasury [shares](../s/shares.md).

## Benefits of NCIB

1. **[Earnings](../e/earnings.md) Per Share (EPS) Improvement**: By reducing the number of outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md), the company can increase its EPS, which can positively affect the stock price.

2. **[Undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) [Shares](../s/shares.md)**: Management may view the current [market price](../m/market_price.md) of its [shares](../s/shares.md) as [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) and take this opportunity to buy back [shares](../s/shares.md) at a lower price.

3. **[Capital Structure](../c/capital_structure.md) [Optimization](../o/optimization.md)**: Companies can optimize their [capital structure](../c/capital_structure.md) by returning excess [capital](../c/capital.md) to shareholders when they do not have profitable [reinvestment](../r/reinvestment.md) opportunities.

4. **[Shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) [Trust](../t/trust.md)**: Demonstrating strong [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and confidence in the company's future can enhance [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) [trust](../t/trust.md).

5. **Countering [Dilution](../d/dilution.md)**: NCIBs can [offset](../o/offset.md) the [dilution](../d/dilution.md) effects caused by mergers, acquisitions, or employee stock [options](../o/options.md).

## Criticisms and Risks

1. **Misallocation of Resources**: Companies might use funds for repurchases that could otherwise be invested in growth opportunities, R&D, or [debt](../d/debt.md) reduction.

2. **Temporary Price Boost**: The increase in stock price due to NCIB may be temporary and not indicative of long-term [value](../v/value.md) improvement.

3. **Management Opportunism**: Executives with stock [options](../o/options.md) or compensation tied to share price manipulation might initiate buybacks for personal [gain](../g/gain.md) rather than for the benefit of the company.

4. **[Debt](../d/debt.md) Increase**: Companies might take on [debt](../d/debt.md) to [finance](../f/finance.md) buybacks, skewing [debt](../d/debt.md)-to-[equity](../e/equity.md) ratios and potentially endangering financial stability.

5. **[Market](../m/market.md) Perception**: Frequent buybacks could be interpreted as a lack of profitable projects or innovative drive within the company.

## NCIB in Practice

### Example: Royal Bank of Canada (RBC)

Royal [Bank](../b/bank.md) of Canada (RBC) is a notable example where NCIBs are effectively utilized. For more detailed information, visit [RBC's NCIB page](https://www.rbc.com/investor-relations/share-buybacks.html). 

RBC announces NCIB programs specifying the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) it intends to repurchase, explaining the rationale behind the repurchase, and detailing the method of [execution](../e/execution.md). These announcements often follow board approval and are aligned with RBCâ€™s strategic [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md).

### Regulatory Context

In Canada, the primary regulatory body overseeing NCIBs is the TSX. Companies [listed](../l/listed.md) on the TSX must comply with specific rules outlined in the TSX Company Manual. These rules pertain to [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) requirements, price limitations, and the maximum number of [shares](../s/shares.md) that can be repurchased. NCIBs are typically restricted to an annual limit of 10% of the public [float](../f/float.md) or 5% of the outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md), whichever is lesser.

## Conclusion

A Normal-Course [Issuer](../i/issuer.md) [Bid](../b/bid.md) presents a strategic tool for companies to manage their [capital](../c/capital.md) structures effectively, maintain [investor](../i/investor.md) confidence, and potentially increase [shareholder value](../s/shareholder_value.md). However, it also presents risks that need careful consideration and governance. Overall, when employed judiciously, NCIBs can contribute significantly to a company's long-term financial strategy and [market](../m/market.md) performance.

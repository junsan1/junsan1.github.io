# Net Realizable Value (NRV)

Net Realizable [Value](../v/value.md) (NRV) is a crucial concept in [accounting](../a/accounting.md), [finance](../f/finance.md), and trading that pertains to the [valuation](../v/valuation.md) of assets and [inventory](../i/inventory.md). NRV represents the estimated selling price of an [asset](../a/asset.md) in the ordinary course of [business](../b/business.md), minus any costs necessary to complete and sell the [asset](../a/asset.md). This metric ensures that assets are not [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md) on [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) and helps businesses align their reported values with the expected economic benefit.

## Definition and Explanation

### Definition
Net Realizable [Value](../v/value.md) (NRV) can be formally defined as the net amount that an entity expects to realize from the [sale](../s/sale.md) of an [asset](../a/asset.md). This is calculated as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of [business](../b/business.md) minus the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the [sale](../s/sale.md).

### Importance
NRV is instrumental in financial reporting and [inventory management](../i/inventory_management.md). By evaluating assets using NRV, companies can present a more realistic financial position, ensuring that their assets are not overstated on the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md). This adds a layer of conservatism to financial reporting, providing more reliable data for stakeholders.

### Calculation
The formula to calculate NRV is straightforward:

\[ \text{NRV} = \text{Estimated Selling Price} - \text{Costs of Completion and Selling} \]

- **Estimated Selling Price**: The expected amount that can be obtained from selling the [asset](../a/asset.md).
- **Costs of Completion**: Any additional costs required to prepare the [asset](../a/asset.md) for [sale](../s/sale.md).
- **Selling Costs**: Costs directly linked to the [sale](../s/sale.md), including [marketing](../m/marketing.md), sales commissions, and transportation.

## Application in Inventory Accounting

### Lower of Cost or NRV
In [inventory accounting](../i/inventory_accounting.md), NRV is often used in conjunction with the "lower of cost or NRV" rule. Under this rule, [inventory](../i/inventory.md) is reported at the lower of either its [historical cost](../h/historical_cost.md) or the NRV. This helps prevent the overstatement of [inventory](../i/inventory.md) and aligns with the conservatism principle in [accounting](../a/accounting.md), which states that potential losses should be recognized as soon as they are foreseeable.

### Practical Example

Consider a [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) company that holds [inventory](../i/inventory.md) of goods that cost $100,000 to produce. The estimated selling price of these goods is $120,000, but there are additional costs of $15,000 associated with completing the [sale](../s/sale.md) (e.g., [marketing](../m/marketing.md), shipping, and sales commissions). 

The NRV of this [inventory](../i/inventory.md) would be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{NRV} = \$120,000 - \$15,000 = \$105,000 \]

In this scenario, the NRV ($105,000) is higher than the cost ($100,000). Therefore, the [inventory](../i/inventory.md) should be reported at its cost of $100,000. However, if any changes occur that lower the NRV below the cost, the [inventory](../i/inventory.md) [value](../v/value.md) must be written down to the NRV, reflecting the potential loss in the [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md).

## Application in Financial Instrument Valuation

NRV also plays a significant role in the [valuation](../v/valuation.md) of financial instruments. For instance, when valuing accounts [receivable](../r/receivable.md), companies estimate the collectible amount, subtracting any allowances for doubtful accounts. This ensures that the accounts [receivable](../r/receivable.md) are not overstated and represent a realistic expectation of future [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md).

### Example: Accounts Receivable

A company has accounts [receivable](../r/receivable.md) of $500,000. Based on historical data and current [market](../m/market.md) conditions, management estimates that $50,000 may be uncollectible. Therefore, the NRV of the accounts [receivable](../r/receivable.md) would be:

\[ \text{NRV} = \$500,000 - \$50,000 = \$450,000 \]

This $450,000 would be reported on the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md), providing a more accurate reflection of the future economic benefit expected from these receivables.

## NRV in Different Industries

### Retail
In the retail [industry](../i/industry.md), NRV is particularly useful for managing [inventory](../i/inventory.md), especially for perishable goods and items prone to obsolescence. Retailers frequently assess their [inventory](../i/inventory.md) to ensure that it is valued correctly, [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for markdowns and promotional discounts that affect the estimated selling price.

### Manufacturing
[Manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) companies regularly use NRV to evaluate work-in-progress (WIP) [inventory](../i/inventory.md). By understanding the costs needed to complete unfinished goods and estimating their selling price, manufacturers can accurately [value](../v/value.md) their WIP [inventory](../i/inventory.md) and make informed decisions about production and pricing strategies.

### Real Estate
In the [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) sector, NRV is used to appraise the [value](../v/value.md) of properties held for [sale](../s/sale.md). [Real estate](../r/real_estate.md) companies must consider the costs required to prepare a property for [sale](../s/sale.md), as well as the potential selling price, to determine the NRV. This helps in ensuring properties are recorded at values that reflect [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

## NRV and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)

Under IFRS, NRV is a vital component of IAS 2 (Inventories). IAS 2 specifies that inventories should be measured at the lower of cost and NRV. This requirement ensures that potential losses are recognized promptly, providing a truthful depiction of a company's financial position.

### Key Points of IAS 2
- **Cost of Inventories**: Includes purchase costs, conversion costs, and other costs incurred to bring the inventories to their present location and condition.
- **NRV**: Reflects the estimated selling price, considering all additional costs of completion and selling.
- **[Write-Down](../w/write-down.md) to NRV**: If NRV falls below cost, inventories must be written down to NRV. Any subsequent increase in NRV can be reversed, but only to the extent of the original [write-down](../w/write-down.md).

### Example under IFRS

A company holds [raw materials](../r/raw_materials.md) with a cost of $200,000. Due to a [market](../m/market.md) downturn, the estimated selling price of products made with these materials drops to $220,000. The costs to complete and sell the products are $30,000. The NRV would be:

\[ \text{NRV} = \$220,000 - \$30,000 = \$190,000 \]

Since $190,000 (NRV) is lower than $200,000 (cost), the [inventory](../i/inventory.md) should be written down to $190,000.

## Conclusion

Net Realizable [Value](../v/value.md) (NRV) is a vital concept in [accounting](../a/accounting.md) and [finance](../f/finance.md) that ensures assets are not [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md) and that [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) reflect a prudent and realistic view of a company's financial position. NRV is widely applied across various industries, from retail and [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) to [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), influencing the management and [valuation](../v/valuation.md) of [inventory](../i/inventory.md), accounts [receivable](../r/receivable.md), and other assets.

By adhering to the principles of NRV, businesses can enhance their financial reporting accuracy, maintain [investor](../i/investor.md) confidence, and make informed economic decisions that drive sustainable growth.

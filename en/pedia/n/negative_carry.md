# Negative Carry

"Negative carry" is a financial term that refers to a situation where the costs of holding a financial position or an [asset](../a/asset.md) exceed the [income](../i/income.md) generated from that position. It is an important concept in both individual [investing](../i/investing.md) and institutional trading, as it can influence decision-making processes regarding [portfolio management](../p/par.md), [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md), and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md).

### Understanding Carry

In [finance](../f/finance.md), "carry" refers to the cost or benefit of holding an investment or a financial position over time. This concept is widely applied across various financial instruments, including bonds, currencies, and [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md). Carry can be positive or negative, depending on the relationship between the cost of holding the [asset](../a/asset.md) and the [income](../i/income.md) it generates. 

- **Positive Carry**: This occurs when the [income](../i/income.md) or returns generated from holding an [asset](../a/asset.md) exceed the costs associated with maintaining it. For example, if you [hold](../h/hold.md) a [bond](../b/bond.md) that pays a 5% annual [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md), but the cost of borrowing [money](../m/money.md) to buy the [bond](../b/bond.md) is only 3%, then the carry is positive because the [income](../i/income.md) exceeds the cost.
  
- **Negative Carry**: Conversely, negative carry arises when the costs of holding an [asset](../a/asset.md) exceed the [income](../i/income.md) it generates. For instance, if you [hold](../h/hold.md) a [bond](../b/bond.md) that yields 2% [interest](../i/interest.md) while the cost of borrowing funds to buy the [bond](../b/bond.md) is 4%, you would be experiencing negative carry.

### Components of Carry

#### Income Generated
The [income](../i/income.md) generated from holding an investment varies based on the type of [asset](../a/asset.md). It can include:
- **[Interest](../i/interest.md) payments**: In the case of bonds and other fixed-[income](../i/income.md) instruments, this refers to the periodic coupon payments received.
- **Dividends**: For [equity](../e/equity.md) positions, this refers to the periodic dividends paid to shareholders.
- **Price appreciation**: For assets such as [stocks](../s/stock.md) or [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), this can also include any appreciation in the [value](../v/value.md) of the [asset](../a/asset.md) over time.
  
#### Costs Incurred
The costs of holding a financial position can include:
- **Borrowing costs**: If the [asset](../a/asset.md) is purchased using borrowed funds, the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) on the borrowed [capital](../c/capital.md) is a crucial [factor](../f/factor.md).
- **Maintenance costs**: This includes any fees or expenses associated with holding the [asset](../a/asset.md), such as storage costs, management fees, or maintenance costs for physical assets.
- **Opportunity costs**: This refers to the potential returns that could have been earned had the funds been allocated to a different investment.

### Examples of Negative Carry

#### Carry Trades in Forex
In the [foreign exchange](../f/foreign_exchange.md) (forex) [market](../m/market.md), a "[carry trade](../c/carry_trade.md)" involves borrowing in a [currency](../c/currency.md) with a low [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) and [investing](../i/investing.md) in a [currency](../c/currency.md) with a higher [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md). The differential between the two [interest](../i/interest.md) rates is the "carry". However, if the [currency](../c/currency.md) in which the investment is made depreciates significantly or if [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) differentials change, the position can result in negative carry. 

Example:
- Borrowing in Japanese Yen (JPY) at a near-zero [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md).
- [Investing](../i/investing.md) in Australian Dollars (AUD) with a higher [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md).
- If the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) in Japan increases or the AUD depreciates, the cost of holding this position may exceed the returns, resulting in negative carry.

#### Holding Physical Commodities
[Investing](../i/investing.md) in physical commodities like gold or oil often involves costs beyond the purchase price. These can include storage costs, [insurance](../i/insurance.md), and transportation fees. If the price of the [commodity](../c/commodity.md) does not appreciate sufficiently to cover these expenses, the position [will](../w/will.md) result in a negative carry.

### Implications of Negative Carry

#### Impact on Investment Returns
Negative carry can erode the overall returns of a portfolio, especially if the position with negative carry represents a significant portion of the investment. It introduces an additional layer of [risk](../r/risk.md), as the [investor](../i/investor.md) must not only consider the potential for price appreciation but also manage the ongoing costs associated with the position.

#### Hedging Strategies
Investors and traders often face negative carry when they implement [hedging strategies](../h/hedging_strategies.md). For instance, purchasing [options](../o/options.md) or other [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) to protect against [downside risk](../d/downside_risk.md) involves upfront costs (premiums) that may not be recovered if the anticipated adverse event does not materialize.

#### Impact on Yield Curve Strategies
[Bond](../b/bond.md) traders and fixed-[income](../i/income.md) portfolio managers need to account for carry when developing [yield curve strategies](../y/yield_curve_strategies.md) such as steepeners or flatteners. If the cost of [financing](../f/financing.md) long positions in bonds outweighs the [income](../i/income.md) generated, the strategy may result in negative carry.

### Risk Management Considerations

#### Monitoring Interest Rate Differentials
For forex carry trades, continuously monitoring [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) differentials between the borrowed and invested currencies is crucial. Changes in [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) or [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md) can rapidly alter these differentials, affecting the potential for negative carry.

#### Managing Leverage
Using [leverage](../l/leverage.md) to enhance returns can amplify the effects of negative carry. Investors should carefully manage [leverage ratios](../l/leverage_ratios.md) to ensure that the costs of borrowed funds do not [offset](../o/offset.md) the [income](../i/income.md) generated by the investment.

#### Diversification
Diversifying the portfolio across different [asset](../a/asset.md) classes and investment strategies can help mitigate the risks associated with negative carry. By spreading investments across various [holdings](../h/holdings.md), the impact of negative carry on any single position is reduced.

### Conclusion

Negative carry represents a significant consideration for investors and traders across various [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). It highlights the importance of understanding the ongoing costs associated with holding an investment and the necessity of balancing these costs against the potential returns. By carefully managing carry, incorporating [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices, and diversifying investment portfolios, [market](../m/market.md) participants can better navigate the complexities of both positive and negative carry scenarios.

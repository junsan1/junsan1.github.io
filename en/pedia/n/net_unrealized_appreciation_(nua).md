# Net Unrealized Appreciation (NUA)

Net Unrealized Appreciation (NUA) is a term primarily used in the context of [tax planning](../t/tax_planning.md) and retirement accounts, particularly those that involve employer-sponsored stock, like company stock held in a [401(k) plan](../1/401(k)_plan.md). NUA refers to the increase in [value](../v/value.md) of company stock while it is held in a retirement plan. It is an important concept for individuals who [hold](../h/hold.md) employer securities in their qualified retirement accounts since it can have significant tax implications when the stock is distributed from the plan.

### Key Concepts

#### Definition
Net Unrealized Appreciation (NUA) specifically refers to the appreciation of the original [value](../v/value.md) of company stock in a retirement account. This can have considerable tax advantages if the stock has appreciated significantly since it was contributed to the plan.

#### NUA Calculation
To calculate NUA, you need to determine the original [value](../v/value.md) of the employer stock at the time it was contributed to the retirement plan (the [cost basis](../c/cost_basis.md)) and its [value](../v/value.md) when it is distributed from the plan. The difference between these two values is the NUA.

**Formula:**
```
NUA = [Value](../v/value.md) of Stock at [Distribution](../d/distribution.md) - [Original Cost](../o/original_cost.md) [Basis](../b/basis.md)
```

#### Tax Implications
One of the primary reasons NUA is important is due to its favorable tax treatment. When stock is distributed from a retirement plan, the [cost basis](../c/cost_basis.md) is taxed as [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md). However, the NUA is taxed at long-term [capital](../c/capital.md) gains rates when the stock is sold, which are typically lower than [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md) tax rates.

1. **[Ordinary Income](../o/ordinary_income.md) Tax**: The [cost basis](../c/cost_basis.md) of the stock is included as [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md) in the year of [distribution](../d/distribution.md).
2. **Long-Term [Capital](../c/capital.md) Gains**: The NUA is subject to long-term [capital gains tax](../c/capital_gains_tax.md) when the stock is sold, regardless of the [holding period](../h/holding_period.md) after the [distribution](../d/distribution.md).

#### Benefits and Considerations
- **Tax Savings**: The main benefit of NUA is the potential for significant tax savings, as long-term [capital gains tax](../c/capital_gains_tax.md) rates are generally lower than [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md) tax rates.
- **Lump Sum [Distribution](../d/distribution.md)**: To take advantage of NUA, the [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of company stock must be a lump-sum [distribution](../d/distribution.md) from the retirement account, which means the entire balance of the account must be distributed within a single tax year.
- **Subsequent Appreciation**: Any subsequent appreciation in the stock after it is distributed [will](../w/will.md) also be subject to [capital gains tax](../c/capital_gains_tax.md), but the [holding period](../h/holding_period.md) for determining whether it qualifies for long-term or short-term treatment starts anew after the [distribution](../d/distribution.md).
- **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: Individuals need to weigh the benefits of NUA tax treatment against the need for proper [diversification](../d/diversification.md) to mitigate investment [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Steps to Implement NUA Strategy

1. **Evaluate Employer Stock**: Determine if you have appreciated employer stock in your 401(k) or similar retirement plan.
2. **Consult a [Financial Advisor](../f/financial_advisor.md)**: Speak with a [financial advisor](../f/financial_advisor.md) or tax professional to understand if taking advantage of NUA is the best strategy based on your specific financial situation.
3. **Lump-Sum [Distribution](../d/distribution.md)**: Plan to take a lump-sum [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of the retirement account including the employer stock.
4. **Separate [Distribution](../d/distribution.md)**: Ensure the employer stock is distributed in-kind to a taxable [brokerage account](../b/brokerage_account.md), keeping the rest of the retirement account separate.
5. **Track [Cost Basis](../c/cost_basis.md) and NUA**: Record the [cost basis](../c/cost_basis.md) and NUA of the distributed stock for tax reporting purposes.
6. **Sell Stock Strategically**: Decide when to sell the stock to maximize long-term [capital](../c/capital.md) gains benefits, keeping in mind [market](../m/market.md) conditions and personal financial needs.

### Example Scenario

Consider an individual, Jim, who holds employer stock in his [401(k) plan](../1/401(k)_plan.md) with a [cost basis](../c/cost_basis.md) of $50,000, and the current [market value](../m/market_value.md) of the stock is $200,000 at the time of [distribution](../d/distribution.md).

1. **[Cost Basis](../c/cost_basis.md)**: $50,000 [will](../w/will.md) be taxed as [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md) in the year of [distribution](../d/distribution.md).
2. **NUA**: $150,000 ($200,000 - $50,000) [will](../w/will.md) be eligible for long-term [capital gains tax](../c/capital_gains_tax.md) treatment when the stock is eventually sold.

If Jim is in the 24% [federal income](../f/federal_income.md) tax bracket for [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md) and the long-term [capital gains tax](../c/capital_gains_tax.md) rate is 15%, the tax implications would be:
- **[Ordinary Income](../o/ordinary_income.md) Tax**: \( $50,000 \times 24\% = $12,000 \)
- **Long-Term [Capital Gains Tax](../c/capital_gains_tax.md)**: \( $150,000 \times 15\% = $22,500 \)

### Practical Considerations

- **Eligibility for NUA**: Not all employer plans allow for NUA treatment, so it is crucial to verify this ahead of time.
- **Age and Early [Distribution](../d/distribution.md) Penalties**: Distributions before age 59½ may be subject to an additional 10% early [distribution](../d/distribution.md) penalty, though NUA distributions can sometimes avoid this penalty.
- **Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)**: Once you reach age 72, required minimum distributions can complicate NUA strategies, so planning ahead is necessary to align NUA with RMD requirements.

### Conclusion
Net Unrealized Appreciation (NUA) represents a potentially significant tax-saving opportunity for those who have company stock within their retirement plans. By understanding how NUA is calculated, the associated tax implications, and strategic planning steps, individuals can make more informed decisions about their retirement distributions.

# Naked Put

A "naked put," also known as an "uncovered put," is an [options](../o/options.md) strategy used by traders and investors in which a [put option](../p/put.md) is sold without having the corresponding short position in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). In simpler terms, the seller of the [put option](../p/put.md) does not [hold](../h/hold.md) any positions in the stock or [security](../s/security.md) that the [put option](../p/put.md) is based on. This strategy involves writing (selling) a [put option](../p/put.md) in the [open market](../o/open_market.md) and is characterized by having [unlimited risk](../u/unlimited_risk.md) — as opposed to a covered put where the seller also holds a short position in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

### Mechanics of the Naked Put Strategy

1. **Selling the [Put Option](../p/put.md)**: When an [investor](../i/investor.md) sells a [put option](../p/put.md), they agree to buy the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) if the option is exercised by the buyer before expiration.
   
2. **Collecting [Premium](../p/premium.md)**: Upon selling the [put option](../p/put.md), the seller immediately collects a [premium](../p/premium.md), which is the price paid by the buyer for the option. This [premium](../p/premium.md) is the [profit](../p/profit.md) that the seller [will](../w/will.md) keep if the option expires worthless (i.e., if the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) stays above the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md)).

3. **Obligation to Buy**: If the [market price](../m/market_price.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) falls below the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) before or at the option's expiration, the seller may be obligated to purchase the [asset](../a/asset.md) at the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md), leading to potential losses.

### Example

Let's break down a concrete example to illustrate the concept better:

1. **Current Scenario**:
   - Stock X is currently trading at $50.
   - A [trader](../t/trader.md) sells a [put option](../p/put.md) with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $45 for a [premium](../p/premium.md) of $2.

2. **Outcomes**:
   - If Stock X stays above $45 until the option’s expiration, the [put option](../p/put.md) expires worthless. The seller keeps the [premium](../p/premium.md) of $2 as [profit](../p/profit.md).
   - If Stock X falls to $40, the option holder [will](../w/will.md) [exercise](../e/exercise.md) the put. The seller must buy Stock X at $45, making an effective loss of $3 per share ($45 [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) - $40 [market price](../m/market_price.md) - $2 [premium](../p/premium.md) received).

### Risk and Reward

#### Risk
The major [risk](../r/risk.md) for a naked put seller is the potential for substantial losses if the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) significantly decreases. Unlike buying a [put option](../p/put.md), where the maximum loss is limited to the [premium](../p/premium.md) paid, selling a naked put exposes the [trader](../t/trader.md) to potentially [unlimited risk](../u/unlimited_risk.md) if the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s price falls sharply.

#### Reward
The [premium](../p/premium.md) received for selling the [put option](../p/put.md) represents the maximum potential [profit](../p/profit.md) if the option expires worthless. This [income](../i/income.md) can be attractive, especially in a flat or bullish [market](../m/market.md) where the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price is not expected to fall significantly.

### Margin Requirements

Brokerages typically require naked put sellers to maintain a [margin account](../m/margin_account.md) due to the high-[risk](../r/risk.md) nature of the strategy. The [margin](../m/margin.md) requirement ensures that the seller has sufficient funds to cover potential losses if obligated to purchase the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

### Strategies and Considerations

#### Selecting Strike Price
When choosing a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) for the naked put, traders often consider several factors:
- **[Market](../m/market.md) Outlook**: The [trader](../t/trader.md)'s view on the future price movement of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).
- **[Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: Higher [volatility](../v/volatility.md) can result in higher premiums but also increased [risk](../r/risk.md).
- **[Support Levels](../s/support_levels.md)**: [Technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) can help identify strong [support levels](../s/support_levels.md) where the [trader](../t/trader.md) believes the price is unlikely to fall below.

#### Timing
[Timing the market](../t/timing_the_market.md) effectively is crucial for the success of a naked put strategy. Traders must have a solid grasp of [market](../m/market.md) trends and potential price movements of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

#### Diversification
To manage [risk](../r/risk.md), traders may diversify their naked put positions across different assets or sectors. This reduces the impact of a poor performance by any single [asset](../a/asset.md) on the overall portfolio.

### Alternatives to Naked Puts

#### Covered Puts
A covered put involves selling a [put option](../p/put.md) while also holding a short position in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). This strategy reduces the [risk](../r/risk.md) compared to a naked put but limits potential gains to the [premium](../p/premium.md) received.

#### Bull Put Spread
A [bull put spread](../b/bull_put_spread.md) involves selling a [put option](../p/put.md) and simultaneously buying another [put option](../p/put.md) with a lower [strike price](../s/strike_price.md). This strategy reduces potential losses at the [expense](../e/expense.md) of limiting maximum [profit](../p/profit.md) to the difference in premiums.

### Real-World Applications

Traders and sophisticated investors employ naked puts for various reasons, including:
- **[Income](../i/income.md) Generation**: Consistently selling [put options](../p/put_options.md) to collect premiums as part of an [income](../i/income.md) strategy.
- **[Portfolio Management](../p/par.md)**: Using naked puts to potentially acquire [stocks](../s/stock.md) at a lower effective cost if prices decline.
- **[Market](../m/market.md) Positioning**: Expressing a bullish or [neutral](../n/neutral.md) outlook on a specific stock or [market index](../m/market_index.md).

### Case Study: Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA)

Imagine an [investor](../i/investor.md) believes Tesla stock, currently trading at $700, [will](../w/will.md) stay above $650 over the next few months. The [investor](../i/investor.md) sells a naked [put option](../p/put.md) with a $650 [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) and a [premium](../p/premium.md) of $20.

- **Initial Setup**: Seller receives a $20 [premium](../p/premium.md) per option.
- **Break-Even Point**: $630 ([strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $650 minus the $20 [premium](../p/premium.md)).
- **Scenarios**:
  - **Stock Above $650 at Expiry**: The [put option](../p/put.md) expires worthless, and the seller keeps the $20 [premium](../p/premium.md).
  - **Stock Below $650 but Above $630**: Seller incurs a loss but is cushioned by the $20 [premium](../p/premium.md).
  - **Stock Below $630**: Seller starts making an effective loss beyond the collected [premium](../p/premium.md).

### Conclusion

Naked puts can be a [lucrative](../l/lucrative.md) strategy for experienced traders who understand the inherent risks and can effectively manage their exposure. This strategy requires careful consideration of [market](../m/market.md) trends, [volatility](../v/volatility.md), and personal [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md). By understanding the mechanics, risks, and potential rewards, traders can utilize naked puts as a powerful tool within their broader investment strategies.

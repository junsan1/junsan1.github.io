He has become well-known for his activist investment strategies, which involve acquiring stakes in underperforming companies and using his influence to drive strategic changes, improve performance, and increase [shareholder value](../s/shareholder_value.md).

## Early Life and Career

Nelson Peltz was born on June 24, 1942, in Brooklyn, New York. He attended the [Wharton School](../w/wharton_school.md) at the University of Pennsylvania, but left before completing his degree to join the family [business](../b/business.md). Peltz started his career by working at A. Peltz & Sons, a food [distribution](../d/distribution.md) [business](../b/business.md) founded by his grandfather. Under his and his brother's stewardship, the small company was transformed into a significant player in the food [industry](../i/industry.md).

## The Founding of Trian Fund Management

In 2005, Nelson Peltz, along with Peter W. May and Edward P. Garden, founded Trian [Fund](../f/fund.md) Management, which specializes in [alternative investment](../a/alternative_investment.md) strategies. The [fund](../f/fund.md) focuses on [investing](../i/investing.md) in publicly traded companies where it believes it can influence positive strategic changes and operational efficiencies. The [firm](../f/firm.md)'s approach blends traditional investment techniques with activist strategies, aiming to create long-term [value](../v/value.md) for its investors.

## Activist Investment Strategy

Nelson Peltz is recognized as one of the most successful activist investors in the world. His strategy typically involves acquiring substantial stakes in companies that, in his view, are underperforming due to poor management, inefficiencies, or misguided strategies. After acquiring a significant stake, Trian [Fund](../f/fund.md) Management engages with the company's [leadership](../l/leadership.md) to advocate for changes designed to unlock [value](../v/value.md). These changes might include cost-cutting measures, strategic realignments, changes in governance, or even mergers and acquisitions.

### High-Profile Activist Campaigns

In the end, Peltz was appointed to the board, and several of his recommendations were adopted.

#### General Electric (GE)

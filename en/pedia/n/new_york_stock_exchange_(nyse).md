# New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)

The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is one of the oldest and most significant stock exchanges in the world, located at 11 Wall Street, Lower Manhattan, New York City. The exchange is a hub for trading equity securities and is operated by Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), an American company that acquired NYSE in 2013. This document will provide an in-depth exploration of the NYSE, covering its history, trading mechanisms, listing requirements, notable companies, and impact on global finance.

## History of the NYSE

The NYSE was founded on May 17, 1792, under the Buttonwood Agreement, which was signed by 24 stockbrokers on Wall Street. The agreement aimed to establish a set of rules for the buying and selling of securities to improve the integrity and efficiency of the financial markets.

Initially focusing on government bonds and a handful of stocks, the NYSE grew rapidly over the years, propelled by the rise of industrialization and the expansion of the American economy. Several significant milestones mark its historical development:
- **1867**: The introduction of the first stock ticker, which revolutionized the way information was conveyed.
- **1878**: The NYSE allowed trading in foreign securities.
- **1929**: The stock market crash, leading into the Great Depression, emphasized the need for better regulation.
- **1971**: The National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) was established, creating a competitor in electronic trading.
- **2006**: The NYSE went public and became NYSE Group, Inc.
- **2007**: The merger with Euronext to form NYSE Euronext.
- **2013**: Acquired by Intercontinental Exchange (ICE).

## Trading Mechanisms

The NYSE operates through a dual system of floor trading and electronic trading via its hybrid market model.

### Floor Trading

The floor of the NYSE, often iconic in media portrayals, involves human traders known as specialists or designated market makers (DMMs) who manage the buying and selling of stocks. The bustling environment facilitates face-to-face interaction and decision-making.
- **Auction Process**: DMMs conduct auctions for stocks at the opening and closing bells, setting the prices by matching buy and sell orders.
- **Role of Brokers**: Floor brokers execute orders on behalf of clients, providing a human element that can employ discretion and judgement.
- **Information Flow**: Real-time data drives the decisions made on the floor, with transactions reported almost instantaneously.

### Electronic Trading

The NYSE's electronic platform, known as NYSE Arca (originally Archipelago Exchange), complements floor trading by enabling remote, automated trading:
- **Execution Speed**: Traders can execute orders in milliseconds, enhancing market liquidity.
- **Algorithmic Trading**: Advanced algorithms can optimize trading strategies based on real-time market data, exploiting price inefficiencies.
- **Access**: Securities listed on NYSE can also be traded electronically, allowing global participation.

## History of the NYSE

The NYSE was founded on May 17, 1792, under the Buttonwood Agreement, which was signed by 24 stockbrokers on [Wall Street](../w/wall_street.md). The agreement aimed to establish a set of rules for the buying and selling of securities to improve the integrity and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) of the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

Initially focusing on government bonds and a handful of [stocks](../s/stock.md), the NYSE grew rapidly over the years, propelled by the rise of [industrialization](../i/industrialization.md) and the [expansion](../e/expansion.md) of the American [economy](../e/economy.md). Several significant milestones mark its historical development:
- **1867**: The introduction of the first stock ticker, which revolutionized the way information was conveyed.
- **1878**: The NYSE allowed trading in foreign securities.
- **1929**: The [stock market crash](../s/stock_market_crash.md), leading into the [Great Depression](../g/great_depression.md), emphasized the need for better regulation.

NYSE Arca, formerly known as Archipelago [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (ArcaEx), is an electronic securities [exchange](../e/exchange.md) in the United States, operating as a fully automated platform for trading equities, [options](../o/options.md), and [exchange](../e/exchange.md)-traded funds (ETFs). It is a subsidiary of the New York Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (NYSE) Group, which itself is part of the Intercontinental [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (ICE). NYSE Arca holds a prominent position in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) due to its innovative technology, which has driven enhanced [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and [trade](../t/trade.md) [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md).

## History and Evolution

### Origins

NYSE Arca traces its roots back to Archipelago [Holdings](../h/holdings.md), an early proponent of electronic communication networks (ECNs). Archipelago was founded in 1996 and aimed to provide a more efficient and transparent [trading platform](../t/trading_platform.md) compared to traditional floor-based exchanges. In 2005, Archipelago merged with the New York Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md), creating a hybrid [market](../m/market.md) structure that combines electronic and floor-based trading.

### Merger with NYSE

In 2006, the NYSE acquired Archipelago, and the platform was rebranded as NYSE Arca. This [merger](../m/merger.md) was part of the broader [trend](../t/trend.md) toward electronic trading and signified the NYSE's commitment to innovation and technological advancement. Since then, NYSE Arca has continued to [leverage](../l/leverage.md) its cutting-edge technology to [offer](../o/offer.md) efficient, transparent, and low-cost trading solutions.

- **[Market](../m/market.md) Orders**: Orders to buy or sell a [security](../s/security.md) immediately at the best available price.
- **Limit Orders**: Orders to buy or sell a [security](../s/security.md) at a specific price or better.
- **Stop Orders**: Orders that become [market](../m/market.md) orders once a specified price is reached.

### Matching Engine

At the heart of NYSE Arca's [trading platform](../t/trading_platform.md) is its matching engine, designed to [handle](../h/handle.md) large volumes of orders with minimal latency. The matching engine processes incoming orders based on a price-time priority system, ensuring that the best-priced orders receive [execution](../e/execution.md) priority and that orders placed earlier are executed before newer orders at the same [price level](../p/price_level.md).

### Market Data

NYSE Arca provides comprehensive [market](../m/market.md) data feeds, including real-time quotes, [trade](../t/trade.md) information, and [order book depth](../o/order_book_depth.md). These data feeds are essential for [market](../m/market.md) participants to make informed trading decisions and to implement [algorithmic trading strategies](../a/algorithmic_trading_strategies.md) effectively.

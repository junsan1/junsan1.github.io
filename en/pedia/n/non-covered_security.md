# Non-Covered Security

A non-covered [security](../s/security.md) refers to a specific classification of financial instruments that are not subjected to particular regulatory or reporting requirements, especially concerning [cost basis](../c/cost_basis.md). [Cost basis](../c/cost_basis.md), in [finance](../f/finance.md), refers to the original [value](../v/value.md) or purchase price of an [asset](../a/asset.md) or investment for tax purposes, adjusted for stock splits, dividends, and [return](../r/return.md) of [capital](../c/capital.md) distributions. The classification of a [security](../s/security.md) as "non-covered" plays a significant role in how tax reporting is managed and affects both the [investor](../i/investor.md) and the [broker](../b/broker.md). Understanding this distinction is crucial for traders, investors, and [finance](../f/finance.md) professionals to ensure compliance with tax regulations and to optimize investment strategies.

## Historical Context and Definition

The concept of non-covered securities has its roots in regulatory reforms aimed at improving [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and compliance in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which instituted the TARP program in response to the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md), also included provisions for modernizing and streamlining tax reporting for securities. This led to the introduction of new rules under the Economic Stabilization Act and the subsequent enactment of IRS regulations on [cost basis](../c/cost_basis.md) reporting.

The IRS defines non-covered securities as those for which brokers are not required to report the [cost basis](../c/cost_basis.md) to the IRS. Generally, securities acquired before a certain date fall into this category. The transition dates vary depending on the type of [security](../s/security.md). For example:

- Equities acquired before January 1, 2011.
- Mutual funds and [Dividend Reinvestment](../d/dividend_reinvestment.md) Plans (DRIPs) acquired before January 1, 2012.
- Other securities, such as bonds, [options](../o/options.md), and other complex financial instruments, acquired before January 1, 2013.

Non-covered securities, therefore, represent a class of investments whose [cost basis](../c/cost_basis.md) information was not required to be reported to the IRS by brokers at the time of [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) under the current regulations.

## Impact on Investors

For investors, the classification of a [security](../s/security.md) as non-covered has significant implications for tax reporting. The responsibility for maintaining accurate [cost basis](../c/cost_basis.md) records for non-covered securities rests predominantly on the [investor](../i/investor.md). This involves tracking the original purchase price and [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for any changes due to splits, dividends, returns of [capital](../c/capital.md), or other corporate actions over the life of the investment.

When it comes time to sell a non-covered [security](../s/security.md), the [investor](../i/investor.md) must report the [cost basis](../c/cost_basis.md) and any [capital](../c/capital.md) gains or losses on their [tax return](../t/tax_return.md). Failure to maintain accurate records can result in reporting discrepancies, higher tax liabilities, and potential penalties. Using [software tools](../s/software_tools_for_trading.md) or keeping meticulous personal records can help investors manage this responsibility effectively.

### Case Study: Investor Implications

**[Investor](../i/investor.md) A purchased 100 [shares](../s/shares.md) of XYZ [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) on December 15, 2010, for $50 per share. Since these [shares](../s/shares.md) were acquired prior to January 1, 2011, they are classified as non-covered securities.**

- **Purchase Information:**
  - Date: December 15, 2010
  - Quantity: 100 [shares](../s/shares.md)
  - Purchase Price: $50 per share
  - Total [Cost Basis](../c/cost_basis.md): $5,000

Now suppose [Investor](../i/investor.md) A sells these 100 [shares](../s/shares.md) on March 10, 2022, for $75 per share. The key challenge for [Investor](../i/investor.md) A is accurately reporting the [cost basis](../c/cost_basis.md) and determining the [capital gain](../c/capital_gain.md) upon [sale](../s/sale.md). Assuming no corporate actions occurred, the [capital gain](../c/capital_gain.md) would be:

- **[Sale](../s/sale.md) Information:**
  - Date: March 10, 2022
  - Quantity: 100 [shares](../s/shares.md)
  - [Sale](../s/sale.md) Price: $75 per share
  - Total [Sale](../s/sale.md) Proceeds: $7,500

**[Capital Gain](../c/capital_gain.md) Calculation:**
- [Cost Basis](../c/cost_basis.md): $5,000 (original purchase price)
- [Sale](../s/sale.md) Proceeds: $7,500
- **[Capital Gain](../c/capital_gain.md): $2,500**

[Investor](../i/investor.md) A must report this [capital gain](../c/capital_gain.md) on their [tax return](../t/tax_return.md) and pay any applicable [capital gains tax](../c/capital_gains_tax.md). Keeping detailed records allowed [Investor](../i/investor.md) A to accurately report the [transaction](../t/transaction.md) and comply with tax regulations.

## Impact on Brokers

Brokers also face specific challenges and [obligations](../o/obligation.md) regarding non-covered securities. Since brokers are not required to report the [cost basis](../c/cost_basis.md) of non-covered securities to the IRS, they often do not maintain detailed records of the original purchase price. However, brokers may provide [cost basis](../c/cost_basis.md) information to their clients as a service, albeit with a disclaimer about the accuracy or completeness of such information.

To help investors with non-covered securities, brokers may [offer](../o/offer.md) tools and resources, such as:

- **[Cost Basis](../c/cost_basis.md) Calculators**: Online tools that help estimate the [cost basis](../c/cost_basis.md) based on historical prices.
- **Historical [Trade](../t/trade.md) Reports**: Access to historical [transaction](../t/transaction.md) data that the [investor](../i/investor.md) can use for record-keeping.
- **Educational Resources**: Information on how to track and report [cost basis](../c/cost_basis.md) for non-covered securities.

Moreover, brokers may incur additional [customer service](../c/customer_service.md) costs as investors seek assistance in calculating and understanding their [cost basis](../c/cost_basis.md).

### Case Study: Broker Obligations

**[Broker](../b/broker.md) B holds accounts for numerous clients, including many who have non-covered securities acquired before the respective transition dates.**

- **Primary Responsibilities:**
  - Provide clients with access to historical [trade](../t/trade.md) data.
  - [Offer](../o/offer.md) tools and resources for [cost basis](../c/cost_basis.md) estimation.
  - Educate clients on the importance of maintaining accurate records.

By [offering](../o/offering.md) these services, [Broker](../b/broker.md) B helps clients comply with tax reporting regulations and enhances client satisfaction. However, [Broker](../b/broker.md) B also makes clear that maintaining the ultimate responsibility for accurate [cost basis](../c/cost_basis.md) reporting rests with the [investor](../i/investor.md), especially for non-covered securities.

## Tax Reporting and Compliance

The tax reporting process for non-covered securities revolves around accurately determining and documenting the [cost basis](../c/cost_basis.md). Investors must include the following details on their tax returns:

- **Description of the [security](../s/security.md)**
- **Date of [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) and [sale](../s/sale.md)**
- **Quantity of securities transacted**
- **[Cost basis](../c/cost_basis.md) at the time of purchase**
- **Selling price**
- **[Capital](../c/capital.md) gains or losses**

The IRS [Form 8949](../f/form_8949.md), "Sales and Other Dispositions of [Capital](../c/capital.md) Assets," is used to report these transactions in detail. The calculated totals from [Form 8949](../f/form_8949.md) are then transferred to Schedule D, "[Capital](../c/capital.md) Gains and Losses." Failure to accurately report these details can result in discrepancies, leading to audits, fines, or other penalties.

### Practical Example: Tax Form Reporting

**[Investor](../i/investor.md) B sold 50 [shares](../s/shares.md) of ABC [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) acquired before the covered [security](../s/security.md) transition date. The selling price was $60 per share, and the original purchase price was $40 per share.**

- **[Transaction](../t/transaction.md) Details:**
  - [Security](../s/security.md): ABC [Corporation](../c/corporation.md)
  - [Acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) Date: May 10, 2010 (non-covered)
  - Quantity: 50 [shares](../s/shares.md)
  - Purchase Price: $40 per share
  - [Sale](../s/sale.md) Date: January 15, 2022
  - [Sale](../s/sale.md) Price: $60 per share

**Tax Reporting Steps:**
1. Calculate the total [cost basis](../c/cost_basis.md) and [sale](../s/sale.md) proceeds:
   - [Cost Basis](../c/cost_basis.md): 50 [shares](../s/shares.md) x $40 = $2,000
   - [Sale](../s/sale.md) Proceeds: 50 [shares](../s/shares.md) x $60 = $3,000

2. Determine the [capital gain](../c/capital_gain.md):
   - [Capital Gain](../c/capital_gain.md): $3,000 - $2,000 = $1,000

3. Report the [transaction](../t/transaction.md) on IRS [Form 8949](../f/form_8949.md) and then transfer the totals to Schedule D.

[Form 8949](../f/form_8949.md) Example Entry:
- **Description of Property**: ABC [Corporation](../c/corporation.md)
- **Date Acquired**: May 10, 2010
- **Date Sold**: January 15, 2022
- **Proceeds**: $3,000
- **Cost or Other [Basis](../b/basis.md)**: $2,000
- **[Gain](../g/gain.md)/Loss**: $1,000

By following these steps, [Investor](../i/investor.md) B ensures compliance with tax reporting requirements and accurately reports the [capital gain](../c/capital_gain.md) derived from the [sale](../s/sale.md) of the non-covered [security](../s/security.md).

## Technology and Automation in Handling Non-Covered Securities

# Noncurrent Assets

Noncurrent assets, also known as [long-term assets](../l/long-term_assets.md), are resources or properties owned by a [business](../b/business.md) that are not expected to be converted into cash within one year from the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) date. They represent the [long-term investments](../l/long-term_investments.md) a company has made to support its operations and grow its [business](../b/business.md). Unlike [current assets](../c/current_assets.md), which include cash, [inventory](../i/inventory.md), and accounts [receivable](../r/receivable.md), noncurrent assets are expected to provide [value](../v/value.md) for more than one year. This category of assets typically includes property, plant, and equipment (PP&E), intangible assets, investments, and other long-term financial assets.

## Types of Noncurrent Assets

### Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E)
PP&E are tangible fixed assets that are used in the production of goods and services. These assets are physical in nature and have a [useful life](../u/useful_life.md) longer than one year. Examples include:

- **Land**: Unlike most other types of PP&E, land is not depreciated since it typically appreciates over time or maintains its [value](../v/value.md).
  
- **Buildings**: These are structures owned by the company and used for [business](../b/business.md) operations. Buildings are depreciated over their useful lives.

- **Machinery and Equipment**: Tools, machinery, and other equipment used in [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) and other [business](../b/business.md) processes. These are also depreciated over their useful lifespan.

- **Vehicles**: Company-owned cars, trucks, and other vehicles used for [business](../b/business.md) purposes. These, too, are depreciated over time.

### Intangible Assets
Intangible assets are non-physical assets that still provide future economic benefits to the company. Examples include:

- **[Goodwill](../g/goodwill.md)**: This arises when a company acquires another [business](../b/business.md) for more than the [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) of its net identifiable assets.

- **Patents**: Exclusive rights granted to companies for their inventions.

- **Trademarks**: Symbols, names, or logos legally registered for use by a company.

- **Copyrights**: Exclusive legal rights given to creators for their works of art, literature, and music.

### Long-term Investments
These are investments that a company intends to [hold](../h/hold.md) for more than one year. Examples include:

- **[Stocks](../s/stock.md) and Bonds**: Long-term [holdings](../h/holdings.md) in other companies' [stocks](../s/stock.md) and bonds.

- **[Real Estate](../r/real_estate.md) Investments**: Properties held for the purpose of earning rental [income](../i/income.md) or [capital](../c/capital.md) appreciation.

### Other Long-term Financial Assets
- **Deferred Tax Assets**: These arise when a company has overpaid [taxes](../t/taxes.md) or has tax losses that can be utilized to [offset](../o/offset.md) future [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md).

- **Long-term Receivables**: Amounts due to the company that [will](../w/will.md) be paid over a period longer than one year.

## Importance of Noncurrent Assets in Financial Analysis

Understanding noncurrent assets is crucial for analyzing a company's [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and long-term viability. Here are some specific reasons:

- **[Capital](../c/capital.md) Intensity**: A high level of noncurrent assets can indicate that a [business](../b/business.md) is [capital](../c/capital.md)-intensive, meaning it requires significant financial investments in property, plant, and equipment to produce goods or services. 

- **[Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) and Amortization**: These noncash expenses reduce [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md), impacting [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) and tax calculations.

- **[Liquidity Ratios](../l/liquidity_ratios.md)**: Since noncurrent assets are not easily converted to cash within one year, a higher proportion of these assets can affect a company's [liquidity ratios](../l/liquidity_ratios.md).

- **[Return on Assets](../r/return_on_assets_(roa).md) (ROA)**: The [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) with which a company uses its assets to generate [profit](../p/profit.md). A higher ROA indicates better performance.

## Accounting for Noncurrent Assets

### Initial Recognition

Noncurrent assets are generally recorded at their cost, which includes the purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing the [asset](../a/asset.md) to its working condition for its intended use. Examples of such costs include:

- Purchase price after deducting discounts.
- Freight charges.
- Installation and setup costs.
- Professional fees related to the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md).

### Depreciation and Amortization

Most noncurrent assets, except land, are subject to [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) or amortization to allocate the cost of the [asset](../a/asset.md) over its [useful life](../u/useful_life.md):

- **[Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md)**: Applied to [tangible assets](../t/tangible_asset.md) like buildings, machinery, and vehicles.
- **Amortization**: Applied to intangible assets such as patents, trademarks, and [goodwill](../g/goodwill.md).

### Impairment of Noncurrent Assets

[Impairment](../i/impairment.md) occurs when the carrying amount of a noncurrent [asset](../a/asset.md) exceeds its recoverable amount. Companies are required to conduct [impairment](../i/impairment.md) tests periodically or when there are indications that an [asset](../a/asset.md) may be impaired. [Impairment](../i/impairment.md) can occur due to:

- Changes in [market](../m/market.md) conditions.
- Technological advancements making an [asset](../a/asset.md) obsolete.
- Decreased [demand](../d/demand.md) for products or services associated with the [asset](../a/asset.md).

When an [impairment](../i/impairment.md) is recognized:

1. **Calculate the Recoverable Amount**: Determine the higher of the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) less costs of disposal or its [value](../v/value.md) in use.
2. **Write Down the [Asset](../a/asset.md)**: If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, the difference is written down.

### Disposal of Noncurrent Assets

When a noncurrent [asset](../a/asset.md) is no longer in use, it may be sold or retired. The [accounting](../a/accounting.md) process involves:

1. **Removing the [Asset](../a/asset.md)'s Carrying Amount**: Eliminate the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s cost and [accumulated depreciation](../a/accumulated_depreciation.md) from the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md).
2. **Recognizing [Gain](../g/gain.md) or Loss**: The difference between the proceeds from disposal and the carrying amount is recognized in the [income statement](../i/income_statement.md) as a [gain](../g/gain.md) or loss.

## Noncurrent Assets in Different Industries

### Manufacturing
[Manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) companies generally have a significant proportion of their assets in PP&E due to the nature of their production processes. For example, a car manufacturer like **Ford** (https://www.ford.com) would have extensive investments in assembly lines, machinery, and factories.

### Technology
Tech companies might have substantial investments in intangible assets such as patents, software, and intellectual property. For instance, **Microsoft** (https://www.microsoft.com) would have a large portion of its noncurrent assets tied up in software development and patents.

### Real Estate
[Real estate](../r/real_estate.md) companies naturally invest heavily in properties, which are classified as noncurrent assets. A company like **Realogy [Holdings](../h/holdings.md) Corp** (https://www.realogy.com) would have an extensive portfolio of properties as part of its long-term [asset](../a/asset.md) base.

## Conclusion

Noncurrent assets play a crucial role in the long-term strategy and operational capacity of businesses. They encompass tangible fixed assets, intangible assets, [long-term investments](../l/long-term_investments.md), and other enduring financial resources. Proper [accounting](../a/accounting.md), regular [impairment](../i/impairment.md) testing, and efficient utilization of these assets are critical for sustaining growth and ensuring the company's financial robustness. As such, they are a key focus in [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md), impacting [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), profitability, and overall [business](../b/business.md) viability.

For individuals, net of tax [income](../i/income.md) signifies the [earnings](../e/earnings.md) left after federal, state, and local [taxes](../t/taxes.md) are subtracted. It is particularly relevant in various scenarios:

### Salary and Wages

When discussing salaries, wages, or any [personal income](../p/personal_income.md), the net of tax amount is what remains after [payroll](../p/payroll.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md), such as:
- **[Federal Income](../f/federal_income.md) Tax**: A [progressive tax](../p/progressive_tax.md) rate applied to [earnings](../e/earnings.md).

- **Local [Taxes](../t/taxes.md)**: Depending on the municipality, there may be additional local [taxes](../t/taxes.md).

- **Applicable [Taxes](../t/taxes.md)**: Corporate [income](../i/income.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) that vary by jurisdiction, including federal, state, and local [taxes](../t/taxes.md).

- **Net [Present Value](../p/present_value.md) (NPV)**: The [present value](../p/present_value.md) of cash flows minus initial investment, discounted at the [rate of return](../r/rate_of_return.md). [Taxes](../t/taxes.md) impact the cash flows and hence the NPV.
- **Internal [Rate of Return](../r/rate_of_return.md) (IRR)**: Reflects the profitability of an investment, considering the [time value](../t/time_value.md) of [money](../m/money.md) including after-tax cash flows.

- **[Financial Statements](../f/financial_statements.md)**: Balance sheets, [income](../i/income.md) statements, and [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) statements should accurately reflect net of tax amounts to provide stakeholders with a true financial position of the company.

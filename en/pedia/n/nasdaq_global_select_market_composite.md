The [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) Global Select [Market](../m/market.md) Composite, often referred to as the [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) Composite or the [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md), is a stock [market index](../m/market_index.md) of the common [stocks](../s/stock.md) and similar securities [listed](../l/listed.md) on the [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) [stock market](../s/stock_market.md). It includes over 3,000 companies across various sectors and is one of the most widely followed indices in the world. 

## Overview of Nasdaq
The [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) [Stock Market](../s/stock_market.md) is an American stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md) located at One Liberty Plaza in New York City. It is ranked second on the list of stock exchanges by [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) of [shares](../s/shares.md) traded, behind only the New York Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (NYSE). [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) was founded by the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), now known as the Financial [Industry](../i/industry.md) Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and its operations began on February 8, 1971. It was the world's first electronic [stock market](../s/stock_market.md).

The name "[Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md)" originally stood for the "National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations." The [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) is owned by [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md), Inc., which also owns several other U.S. stock exchanges, including the Philadelphia Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md).

## Nasdaq Composite
The [Nasdaq Composite Index](../n/nasdaq_composite_index.md) is a [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md)-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md) of over 3,000 [stocks](../s/stock.md) [listed](../l/listed.md) on the [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md). It is one of the most followed indices in assessing the performance of [stocks](../s/stock.md) in the United States alongside the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Unlike other major indices, the [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) Composite is heavily [weighted](../w/weighted.md) towards technology-oriented companies. As such, it is often used as a [proxy](../p/proxy.md) for the performance of the [technology sector](../t/technology_sector.md). This can make it particularly volatile as compared to more diversified indices, as technology [stocks](../s/stock.md) can be more easily influenced by [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md), economic data, and other external factors.

## Companies Listed
The [Nasdaq Composite Index](../n/nasdaq_composite_index.md) includes companies from a wide [range](../r/range.md) of industries beyond just technology, including healthcare, consumer services, [finance](../f/finance.md), and industrial. However, some of the largest and most influential companies within the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) are major tech companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet (Google). These companies often have a significant impact on the overall performance of the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) due to their substantial [market](../m/market.md) capitalizations.

## Criteria for Listing
A company must meet specific eligibility criteria to be [listed](../l/listed.md) on the [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) Global Select [Market](../m/market.md). These criteria include financial, [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), and [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) requirements. Generally, the selection criteria aim to include companies that have high standards of [financial health](../f/financial_health.md), performance, and [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md).

Some of the specific requirements include:
1. **Minimum [Bid Price](../b/bid_price.md)**: Companies must have a minimum closing [bid price](../b/bid_price.md) of $4 per share.
2. **[Stockholders' Equity](../s/stockholders'_equity.md)**: Companies must have [stockholders' equity](../s/stockholders'_equity.md) of at least $5 million.

## Trading on Nasdaq
Trading on [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) is characterized by an all-electronic [trading environment](../t/trading_environment.md), which offers several advantages over traditional trading floors, such as speed, [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md), and the ability to [handle](../h/handle.md) a high [volume](../v/volume.md) of trades. [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) employs a [dealer](../d/dealer.md)'s [market](../m/market.md) model where [market](../m/market.md) makers provide [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and facilitate the trading process. These [market](../m/market.md) makers use their own [capital](../c/capital.md) to buy and sell [shares](../s/shares.md) of a particular stock, which helps to ensure [market](../m/market.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and tighter [bid](../b/bid.md)-ask [spreads](../s/spreads.md).

# Nasdaq Capital Market

The [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) [Capital](../c/capital.md) [Market](../m/market.md) (formerly known as the [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) SmallCap [Market](../m/market.md)) is a [trading platform](../t/trading_platform.md) under the [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) [Stock Market](../s/stock_market.md) umbrella, designed to facilitate [capital](../c/capital.md) growth by providing a [market](../m/market.md) for smaller, less capitalized companies. It serves as an essential segment of the [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) [Stock Market](../s/stock_market.md) and is part of the broader [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) ecosystem, which includes the [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) Global [Market](../m/market.md) and the [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) Global Select [Market](../m/market.md). This [market](../m/market.md) caters primarily to companies that do not meet the initial [listing requirements](../l/listing_requirements.md) for the more stringent segments of the [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) [market](../m/market.md) but still seek the [visibility](../v/visibility.md) and credibility that come with listing on a prominent [exchange](../e/exchange.md).

## Overview

### Purpose and Function

The [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) [Capital](../c/capital.md) [Market](../m/market.md) aims to [offer](../o/offer.md) companies with relatively lower [market](../m/market.md) capitalizations a platform to access public [capital](../c/capital.md), thereby enhancing their growth potential. This segment is instrumental for businesses that are in the nascent stages of their growth trajectory but possess significant potential for [expansion](../e/expansion.md).

### Listing Requirements

The [listing requirements](../l/listing_requirements.md) for the [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) [Capital](../c/capital.md) [Market](../m/market.md) are less stringent in comparison to the [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) Global [Market](../m/market.md) and [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) Global Select [Market](../m/market.md), but they are still substantial to ensure a level of reliability and [investor](../i/investor.md) protection. Key requirements include:

- **Stock Price**: Companies must maintain a minimum [bid price](../b/bid_price.md) of $4.
- **[Market Value](../m/market_value.md)**: There are different standards under which companies can qualify. Generally, a company must have a [market value](../m/market_value.md) of publicly held [shares](../s/shares.md) of at least $15 million.
- **Financial Requirements**: Companies must meet specific financial standards related to [income](../i/income.md), [equity](../e/equity.md), and total assets as detailed by [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md)'s listing rules.
- **[Corporate Governance](../c/corporate_governance.md)**: Adherence to [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md)’s [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) requirements is mandatory.

## Importance to Companies

### Growth Capital

The primary advantage of being [listed](../l/listed.md) on the [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) [Capital](../c/capital.md) [Market](../m/market.md) is access to growth [capital](../c/capital.md). Companies can raise funds through public offerings, which can be used for various purposes such as research and development, acquisitions, and expanding operational capabilities.

### Visibility and Credibility

Being [listed](../l/listed.md) on [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) provides a company with increased [visibility](../v/visibility.md) and credibility. Investors, analysts, and potential customers often view a [listed](../l/listed.md) company as more stable and reliable compared to private firms or those [listed](../l/listed.md) on less recognized exchanges.

### Liquidity

Listing on the [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) [Capital](../c/capital.md) [Market](../m/market.md) provides enhanced [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) for a company’s [shares](../s/shares.md). This increased [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) can result in reduced [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md) and improved attractiveness to institutional and retail investors.

## Importance to Investors

### Access to Emerging Companies

Investors [gain](../g/gain.md) access to a pool of emerging companies with significant growth potential. These companies often operate in innovative sectors and can [offer](../o/offer.md) substantial returns, although they come with higher risks compared to more established firms.

### Regulatory Oversight

Investors benefit from the regulatory oversight provided by [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md), which ensures that [listed](../l/listed.md) companies adhere to specific standards related to [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md), [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md), and financial reporting.

## Differences from Other Nasdaq Markets

### Nasdaq Global Market

The [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) Global [Market](../m/market.md) represents companies with larger [market](../m/market.md) capitalizations and stronger [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) compared to those on the [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) [Capital](../c/capital.md) [Market](../m/market.md). The [listing requirements](../l/listing_requirements.md) for the Global [Market](../m/market.md) are more stringent, focusing on higher [revenue](../r/revenue.md) and [earnings](../e/earnings.md) criteria.

### Nasdaq Global Select Market

The [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) Global Select [Market](../m/market.md) is designated for the largest and most [liquid](../l/liquid.md) companies. It has the highest listing standards, encompassing stringent financial, [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), and [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) requirements.

## Case Studies of Notable Listings

### Example 1: Success Story

An emerging technology [firm](../f/firm.md), after having [listed](../l/listed.md) on the [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) [Capital](../c/capital.md) [Market](../m/market.md), managed to raise substantial [capital](../c/capital.md) through subsequent public offerings. This funding enabled the company to expand its research and development efforts, leading to groundbreaking innovations and eventual graduation to the [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) Global [Market](../m/market.md).

### Example 2: Growth and Acquisition

A biotech company utilized the [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) [Capital](../c/capital.md) [Market](../m/market.md) for its IPO, raising funds necessary to proceed with clinical trials and product development. Over the years, the growth in its capabilities and [product portfolio](../p/product_portfolio.md) made it an attractive [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) target, leading to a successful [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) by a larger [industry](../i/industry.md) player.

## Challenges and Risks

### Volatility

Companies [listed](../l/listed.md) on the [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) [Capital](../c/capital.md) [Market](../m/market.md) are often subject to higher [volatility](../v/volatility.md). Their smaller size and emerging nature can lead to larger price swings, influenced by [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md), operational performance, and broader [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md).

### Regulatory Compliance

Maintaining listing status requires ongoing compliance with [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) regulations. Companies must continually meet financial standards, [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) requirements, and [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) norms, which can be resource-intensive, especially for smaller firms.

### Market Perception

While listing on the [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) [Capital](../c/capital.md) [Market](../m/market.md) provides credibility, companies might still face challenges from [market](../m/market.md) perceptions, especially if they [fail](../f/fail.md) to demonstrate consistent performance or face regulatory issues.

## Transition to Higher Tiers

### Graduation Process

Companies [listed](../l/listed.md) on the [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) [Capital](../c/capital.md) [Market](../m/market.md) can graduate to higher tiers such as the [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) Global [Market](../m/market.md) or the [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) Global Select [Market](../m/market.md) upon meeting the respective [listing requirements](../l/listing_requirements.md). This transition signifies growth and improved [financial health](../f/financial_health.md).

### Benefits of Transition

Transitioning to a higher [market](../m/market.md) tier:

- Enhances corporate prestige.
- Provides access to a broader [investor](../i/investor.md) base.
- Potentially improves stock [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and [valuation](../v/valuation.md).

## Conclusion

The [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) [Capital](../c/capital.md) [Market](../m/market.md) plays a crucial role in the financial ecosystem by providing smaller companies with a platform to grow and access public [capital](../c/capital.md). For investors, it presents opportunities to invest in emerging companies with high growth potential, albeit with higher associated risks. The regulatory framework and oversight ensure a level of credibility and protection, benefiting both companies and investors. As businesses mature and meet more stringent requirements, the potential for graduation to higher [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) tiers offers further growth and [visibility](../v/visibility.md), fostering a dynamic and progressive [trading environment](../t/trading_environment.md).

# Non-Traded REIT

A Non-Traded [Real Estate](../r/real_estate.md) Investment [Trust](../t/trust.md) (Non-Traded REIT) is a type of [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) investment that offers investors an opportunity to invest in a diversified portfolio of [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) without being [listed](../l/listed.md) on a stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md). This [investment vehicle](../i/investment_vehicle.md) combines aspects of both private and public [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) ownership, providing investors with potential benefits such as [portfolio diversification](../p/portfolio_diversification.md), [income](../i/income.md) generation, and long-term [capital](../c/capital.md) appreciation.

## Introduction to REITs

[Real Estate](../r/real_estate.md) Investment Trusts (REITs) are companies that own, operate, or [finance](../f/finance.md) [income](../i/income.md)-producing [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) across a [range](../r/range.md) of property sectors. Investors buy [shares](../s/shares.md) in REITs, thereby enabling them to invest in large-scale, [income](../i/income.md)-producing [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) without having to buy, manage, or [finance](../f/finance.md) any properties themselves.

There are several types of REITs based on their investment focus and structure, including:

- **[Equity](../e/equity.md) REITs**: Own and operate [income](../i/income.md)-producing [real estate](../r/real_estate.md).
- **[Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) REITs (mREITs)**: Provide [financing](../f/financing.md) for [income](../i/income.md)-producing [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) by purchasing or originating mortgages and [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-backed securities.
- **Publicly-traded REITs**: [Listed](../l/listed.md) on major stock exchanges and can be bought and sold through a brokerage.
- **Private REITs**: Not [listed](../l/listed.md) on public exchanges and sold to institutional and accredited investors.
- **Non-Traded REITs**: Registered with the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) but not [listed](../l/listed.md) on any stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md).

## Characteristics of Non-Traded REITs

### 1. Registration and Regulation
Non-Traded REITs are registered with the SEC, which means they must adhere to strict regulatory requirements regarding [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md), financial reporting, and governance. This provides a level of [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and [investor](../i/investor.md) protection not available with private [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) investments, though less than publicly-traded REITs.

### 2. Liquidity
Non-Traded REITs are illiquid compared to publicly-traded REITs. [Shares](../s/shares.md) cannot be easily bought or sold on an [open](../o/open.md) marketplace, which means investors might need to [hold](../h/hold.md) their investment until the REIT completes a [liquidity event](../l/liquidity_event.md), such as listing on a public [exchange](../e/exchange.md), merging with another entity, or selling its assets.

### 3. Valuation
The [valuation](../v/valuation.md) of Non-Traded REITs can be less transparent than that of publicly-traded REITs because there is no daily pricing mechanism. Valuations are typically performed by independent appraisers periodically, and the estimated net [asset](../a/asset.md) [value](../v/value.md) (NAV) is updated according to these appraisals.

### 4. Fees and Expenses
Non-Traded REITs generally have higher fees and expenses compared to publicly-traded REITs. These can include organizational and [offering](../o/offering.md) costs, [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) fees, [asset management](../a/asset_management.md) fees, [property management](../p/property_management.md) fees, and [disposition](../d/disposition.md) fees. These costs can significantly impact the [total return](../t/total_return.md) on investment.

### 5. Distribution Payments
Like other REITs, Non-Traded REITs are required to distribute at least 90% of their [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md) to shareholders in the form of dividends. These distributions provide regular [income](../i/income.md) to investors, although the amount can vary based on the performance of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) assets.

### 6. Investment Strategy
Non-Traded REITs could focus on various property types such as office buildings, multifamily housing, retail centers, industrial properties, and healthcare facilities. They may also employ different strategies, including [value](../v/value.md)-add (renovation and improvement of properties), core-plus ([income](../i/income.md)-producing with moderate appreciation potential), and opportunistic (high [risk](../r/risk.md)/reward with substantial rehabilitation or development).

## Risks Associated with Non-Traded REITs

### 1. Lack of Liquidity
The primary [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with Non-Traded REITs is the lack of [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md). Investors may face difficulty selling their [shares](../s/shares.md) before a [liquidity event](../l/liquidity_event.md) occurs, which can span several years.

### 2. Market Risk
While Non-Traded REITs are not subject to the same [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) as publicly-traded REITs, they are still affected by the performance of the [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) [market](../m/market.md). Economic downturns, changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, and property-specific issues can impact the [value](../v/value.md) and performance of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets.

### 3. Valuation Risk
Due to the infrequent [valuation](../v/valuation.md) practices, the NAV of a Non-Traded REIT might not accurately reflect the [market value](../m/market_value.md) of its assets. This can result in investors purchasing or selling [shares](../s/shares.md) at prices that do not fully represent the true [asset](../a/asset.md) [value](../v/value.md).

### 4. High Fees
The various fees associated with Non-Traded REITs can erode investment returns. Investors need to carefully review the [fee](../f/fee.md) structure to understand the net returns on their investment.

### 5. Sponsor Risk
The performance of a Non-Traded REIT heavily relies on the expertise and operational capabilities of the sponsor and management team. Poor decisions by the management can adversely affect the REIT’s performance and, consequently, [investor](../i/investor.md) returns.

## Advantages of Non-Traded REITs

### 1. Diversification
[Investing](../i/investing.md) in Non-Traded REITs allows investors to diversify their portfolios with exposure to [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), which might behave differently compared to traditional [stocks](../s/stock.md) and bonds. [Real estate](../r/real_estate.md) often exhibits lower [correlation](../c/correlation.md) with broader markets.

### 2. Income Generation
Non-Traded REITs provide an [income](../i/income.md) stream through [distribution](../d/distribution.md) payments. This can be especially attractive to [income](../i/income.md)-focused investors looking for regular [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md).

### 3. Long-Term Appreciation
Non-Traded REITs often invest in properties with long-term appreciation potential, aiming to increase the [value](../v/value.md) of the [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) [holdings](../h/holdings.md) over time through [strategic management](../s/strategic_management.md) and development.

### 4. Insulation from Market Volatility
Since Non-Traded REITs are not traded on public exchanges, they are less affected by short-term [market](../m/market.md) fluctuations and [volatility](../v/volatility.md), [offering](../o/offering.md) a relatively more stable investment option for conservative investors.

## Non-Traded REITs in Investment Portfolios

Non-Traded REITs can serve as a [complement](../c/complement.md) to traditional investment portfolios, [offering](../o/offering.md) both [diversification](../d/diversification.md) and exposure to [real estate](../r/real_estate.md). However, they are best suited for investors with a higher [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) and long-term investment horizons due to their illiquid nature and potential risks.

### Allocation Strategy
Financial advisors generally recommend a thoughtful allocation strategy to incorporate Non-Traded REITs into a broader investment portfolio. Typically, these investments should represent a smaller portion of the portfolio, balancing the potential benefits with their inherent risks.  

## Key Considerations Before Investing in Non-Traded REITs

### 1. Investment Objectives
Investors should assess whether Non-Traded REITs align with their investment objectives, [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md), and [time horizon](../t/time_horizon.md). These investments are particularly suited for those seeking long-term growth and steady [income](../i/income.md) but willing to accept limited [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).

### 2. Due Diligence
Thorough [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md) is essential when selecting Non-Traded REITs. Investors should evaluate the track record of the sponsor, [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md), the quality of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets, and the [fee](../f/fee.md) structure.

### 3. Financial Goals and Constraints
Understanding personal financial goals and constraints is crucial. Investors need to ensure they don’t overcommit to illiquid investments and maintain sufficient [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) for other financial needs.

### 4. Regulatory Environment
Staying informed about the regulatory environment around Non-Traded REITs helps investors understand the implications of changes in laws, regulations, and [market](../m/market.md) conditions that may affect their investments.

## Examples of Non-Traded REITs

Some well-known companies that sponsor Non-Traded REITs include:

- **Blackstone [Real Estate](../r/real_estate.md) [Income](../i/income.md) [Trust](../t/trust.md) (BREIT)**: BREIT focuses on multifamily, industrial, hotel, office, and retail properties. [BREIT Website](https://www.breit.com/)
- **Griffin [Capital](../c/capital.md) Company**: Griffin [Capital](../c/capital.md) sponsors Non-Traded REITs with a focus on [income](../i/income.md)-producing office and industrial properties. [Griffin Capital Website](https://www.griffincapital.com/)

These examples represent the diverse [range](../r/range.md) of properties and strategies that Non-Traded REITs can encompass.

## Conclusion

Non-Traded REITs [offer](../o/offer.md) investors an alternative means of gaining exposure to [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) assets without the [volatility](../v/volatility.md) of public markets. While they come with distinct benefits such as [diversification](../d/diversification.md), regular [income](../i/income.md), and potential for long-term appreciation, they also carry risks including [illiquidity](../i/illiquid.md), high fees, and [valuation](../v/valuation.md) uncertainties. Prospective investors should perform comprehensive [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md) and consider their overall portfolio strategy, financial goals, and [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) when evaluating Non-Traded REITs as part of their investment approach.

# Net Current Asset Value Per Share (NCAVPS)

Net Current [Asset](../a/asset.md) [Value](../v/value.md) Per Share (NCAVPS) is a financial metric that was popularized by [Benjamin Graham](../b/benjamin_graham.md), an influential [economist](../e/economist.md) and professional [investor](../i/investor.md) known as the father of [value investing](../v/value_investing.md). NCAVPS is used to evaluate the [liquidation value](../l/liquidation_value.md) of a company on a per-share [basis](../b/basis.md). It is calculated by taking a company’s net [current assets](../c/current_assets.md) ([current assets](../c/current_assets.md) minus [current liabilities](../c/current_liabilities.md)) and dividing by the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) outstanding. This measure provides insight into the inherent [value](../v/value.md) of a company if it were forced to cease operations and [liquidate](../l/liquidate.md) its [current assets](../c/current_assets.md).

## Understanding NCAVPS

To understand how NCAVPS works, it is essential to first grasp the concept of net [current assets](../c/current_assets.md):

- **[Current Assets](../c/current_assets.md):** These include cash and [cash equivalents](../c/cash_equivalents.md), accounts [receivable](../r/receivable.md), [inventory](../i/inventory.md), [marketable securities](../m/marketable_securities.md), and other assets that are expected to be liquidated or turned into cash within one year.
- **[Current Liabilities](../c/current_liabilities.md):** These are [obligations](../o/obligation.md) that the company expects to settle within one year. They include accounts payable, [short-term debt](../s/short-term_debt.md), accrued liabilities, and other similar [obligations](../o/obligation.md).

The formula for calculating NCAVPS is:

\[ \text{NCAVPS} = \frac{\text{Current Assets} - \text{[Current Liabilities](../c/current_liabilities.md)}}{\text{Outstanding [Shares](../s/shares.md)}} \]

## Significance of NCAVPS

The NCAVPS metric is highly regarded in [value investing](../v/value_investing.md), particularly when identifying [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md). Here are some key points that underline its importance:

1. **[Intrinsic Value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) [Indicator](../i/indicator.md):** NCAVPS helps investors evaluate whether a company’s stock price is trading below its [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md). A stock trading below its NCAVPS may be considered [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md), presenting a potential buying opportunity.
2. **[Margin of Safety](../m/margin_of_safety.md):** It offers a [margin of safety](../m/margin_of_safety.md) for investment. If the [market price](../m/market_price.md) of a stock is less than or close to its NCAVPS, the [downside risk](../d/downside_risk.md) is limited since investors can theoretically recover their investments through [asset](../a/asset.md) [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md).
3. **Defensive [Investing](../i/investing.md):** NCAVPS is a conservative approach to [investing](../i/investing.md). It focuses on companies with sound [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and low [debt](../d/debt.md) levels, thus minimizing investment [risk](../r/risk.md).

## How to Calculate NCAVPS

To illustrate the calculation of NCAVPS, consider a hypothetical company with the following financial data:

- **[Current Assets](../c/current_assets.md):** $1,000,000
- **[Current Liabilities](../c/current_liabilities.md):** $400,000
- **[Shares](../s/shares.md) Outstanding:** 100,000

First, calculate the net [current assets](../c/current_assets.md):

\[ \text{Net Current Assets} = \text{Current Assets} - \text{[Current Liabilities](../c/current_liabilities.md)} \]
\[ \text{Net [Current Assets](../c/current_assets.md)} = \$1,000,000 - \$400,000 = \$600,000 \]

Next, divide the net [current assets](../c/current_assets.md) by the number of outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md):

\[ \text{NCAVPS} = \frac{\$600,000}{100,000} = \$6.00 \]

In this case, the NCAVPS is $6.00. If the company's stock is trading below $6.00, it may be considered [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md).

## Practical Application of NCAVPS

Many investors have effectively used NCAVPS to find [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md), particularly in distressed or small-cap companies. Graham, for instance, emphasized [investing](../i/investing.md) in companies whose [market price](../m/market_price.md) was less than two-thirds of their NCAVPS. For practical application, it’s important to vet the reliability of assets and the likelihood of liquidating them at their book values.

### Advantages

1. **Simplifies [Valuation](../v/valuation.md):** It provides a straightforward way to assess a company’s [liquidation value](../l/liquidation_value.md).
2. **Reduces [Risk](../r/risk.md):** By focusing on [current assets](../c/current_assets.md), it reduces exposure to [long-term liabilities](../l/long-term_liabilities.md) and potential future losses.
3. **Easy Comparison:** Allows easy comparison between companies in similar industries based on their [asset](../a/asset.md) values.

### Limitations

1. **Ignores Future Growth:** NCAVPS does not consider the company’s potential for future growth and [earnings](../e/earnings.md).
2. **Not Suitable for All Sectors:** It is less useful for companies with significant intangible assets, such as technology firms.
3. **Marketability of Assets:** The actual [liquidation value](../l/liquidation_value.md) could be lower if assets cannot be sold at [book value](../b/book_value.md).

## Case Studies and Examples

### Example 1: A Retail Company

Consider Company XYZ, a retail [firm](../f/firm.md) with the following financial data as of the end of the fiscal year:

- **[Current Assets](../c/current_assets.md):** $5,000,000
- **[Current Liabilities](../c/current_liabilities.md):** $3,000,000
- **[Shares](../s/shares.md) Outstanding:** 500,000

The net [current assets](../c/current_assets.md) are:

\[ \text{Net [Current Assets](../c/current_assets.md)} = 5,000,000 - 3,000,000 = 2,000,000 \]

The NCAVPS is:

\[ \text{NCAVPS} = \frac{2,000,000}{500,000} = 4.00 \]

Therefore, if Company XYZ’s stock is trading at $3.00 per share, the stock is trading below its NCAVPS and may represent an [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) opportunity.

### Example 2: A Manufacturing Firm

Consider Company ABC, a [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) enterprise:

- **[Current Assets](../c/current_assets.md):** $8,000,000
- **[Current Liabilities](../c/current_liabilities.md):** $2,500,000
- **[Shares](../s/shares.md) Outstanding:** 250,000

Calculating net [current assets](../c/current_assets.md):

\[ \text{Net [Current Assets](../c/current_assets.md)} = 8,000,000 - 2,500,000 = 5,500,000 \]

Calculating NCAVPS:

\[ \text{NCAVPS} = \frac{5,500,000}{250,000} = 22.00 \]

If the stock of Company ABC is trading at $20.00, it is trading below its NCAVPS, which might indicate a buying opportunity.

## Modern Use Cases

In today's [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), NCAVPS can still be a valuable tool for discerning investors. It is particularly useful in the following scenarios:

1. **Distressed Companies:** Investors seeking opportunities in distressed or struggling companies can use NCAVPS to identify firms trading below their [liquidation value](../l/liquidation_value.md).
2. **Small-Cap [Stocks](../s/stock.md):** Smaller companies often have less analyst coverage, which might result in inefficiencies that careful analysis of NCAVPS can exploit.
3. **Screening Tool:** Investors can use NCAVPS as a screening tool to filter [stocks](../s/stock.md) that meet specific [value](../v/value.md) criteria before performing detailed [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md).

### Example: Financial Screening

A financial analyst might use NCAVPS to screen a universe of [stocks](../s/stock.md) in the [Consumer Goods](../c/consumer_goods.md) sector. By filtering out [stocks](../s/stock.md) trading above their NCAVPS, the analyst focuses on those potential bargains, minimizing [downside risk](../d/downside_risk.md).

## Software and Tools for Calculating NCAVPS

Several financial software and platforms can help investors calculate and analyze NCAVPS:

1. **[Bloomberg Terminal](../b/bloomberg_terminal.md):** Provides comprehensive financial data and tools for calculating NCAVPS.
2. **[Reuters](../r/reuters.md) Eikon:** Offers financial data and analytics capabilities, including the calculation of NCAVPS.
3. **Financial Websites:** Sites like [Yahoo Finance](../y/yahoo_finance.md), Google [Finance](../f/finance.md), and MarketWatch often provide detailed financial data allowing for manual calculation of NCAVPS.
4. **Excel:** Using Excel or Google Sheets, investors can easily set up templates for calculating NCAVPS using formulae based on placeholders for [current assets](../c/current_assets.md), [current liabilities](../c/current_liabilities.md), and [shares](../s/shares.md) outstanding.

## Conclusion

Net Current [Asset](../a/asset.md) [Value](../v/value.md) Per Share (NCAVPS) is a valuable metric in [value investing](../v/value_investing.md), focusing on the [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) of a company based on its net [current assets](../c/current_assets.md). This conservative approach, championed by [Benjamin Graham](../b/benjamin_graham.md), helps investors identify potentially [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md), providing a [margin of safety](../m/margin_of_safety.md) by mitigating [downside risk](../d/downside_risk.md). However, it is important to [note](../n/note.md) its limitations, especially in sectors with significant intangible assets or growth potentials. Despite these constraints, NCAVPS continues to [offer](../o/offer.md) valuable insights for discerning [value](../v/value.md) investors, particularly in small-cap and distressed [stocks](../s/stock.md). For those interested in using this metric as part of their [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md), a [range](../r/range.md) of tools and financial platforms are available to facilitate its calculation and application.

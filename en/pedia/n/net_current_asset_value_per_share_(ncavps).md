# Net Current Asset Value Per Share (NCAVPS)

Net Current Asset Value Per Share (NCAVPS) is a financial metric that was popularized by Benjamin Graham, an influential economist and professional investor known as the father of value investing. NCAVPS is used to evaluate the liquidation value of a company on a per-share basis. It is calculated by taking a company’s net current assets (current assets minus current liabilities) and dividing by the number of shares outstanding. This measure provides insight into the inherent value of a company if it were forced to cease operations and liquidate its current assets.

## Understanding NCAVPS

To understand how NCAVPS works, it is essential to first grasp the concept of net current assets:

- **Current Assets:** These include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventory, marketable securities, and other assets that are expected to be liquidated or turned into cash within one year.
- **Current Liabilities:** These are obligations that the company expects to settle within one year. They include accounts payable, short-term debt, accrued liabilities, and other similar obligations.

The formula for calculating NCAVPS is:

\[ \text{NCAVPS} = \frac{\text{Current Assets} - \text{Current Liabilities}}{\text{Outstanding Shares}} \]

## Significance of NCAVPS

The NCAVPS metric is highly regarded in value investing, particularly when identifying undervalued stocks. Here are some key points that underline its importance:

1. **Intrinsic Value Indicator:** NCAVPS helps investors evaluate whether a company’s stock price is trading below its intrinsic value. A stock trading below its NCAVPS may be considered undervalued, presenting a potential buying opportunity.
2. **Margin of Safety:** It offers a margin of safety for investment. If the market price of a stock is less than or close to its NCAVPS, the downside risk is limited since investors can theoretically recover their investments through asset liquidation.
3. **Defensive Investing:** NCAVPS is a conservative approach to investing. It focuses on companies with sound financial health and low debt levels, thus minimizing investment risk.

## How to Calculate NCAVPS

To illustrate the calculation of NCAVPS, consider a hypothetical company with the following financial data:

- **Current Assets:** $1,000,000
- **Current Liabilities:** $400,000
- **Shares Outstanding:** 100,000

First, calculate the net current assets:

\[ \text{Net Current Assets} = \text{Current Assets} - \text{Current Liabilities} \]
\[ \text{Net Current Assets} = \$1,000,000 - \$400,000 = \$600,000 \]

Next, divide the net current assets by the number of outstanding shares:

\[ \text{NCAVPS} = \frac{\$600,000}{100,000} = \$6.00 \]

In this case, the NCAVPS is $6.00. If the company's stock is trading below $6.00, it may be considered undervalued.

## Practical Application of NCAVPS

Many investors have effectively used NCAVPS to find undervalued stocks, particularly in distressed or small-cap companies. Graham, for instance, emphasized investing in companies whose market price was less than two-thirds of their NCAVPS. For practical application, it’s important to vet the reliability of assets and the likelihood of liquidating them at their book values.

### Advantages

1. **Simplifies Valuation:** It provides a straightforward way to assess a company’s liquidation value.
2. **Reduces Risk:** By focusing on current assets, it reduces exposure to long-term liabilities and potential future losses.
3. **Easy Comparison:** Allows easy comparison between companies in similar industries based on their asset values.

### Limitations

1. **Ignores Future Growth:** NCAVPS does not consider the company’s potential for future growth and earnings.
2. **Not Suitable for All Sectors:** It is less useful for companies with significant intangible assets, such as technology firms.
3. **Marketability of Assets:** The actual liquidation value could be lower if assets cannot be sold at book value.

## Case Studies and Examples

### Example 1: A Retail Company

Consider Company XYZ, a retail firm with the following financial data as of the end of the fiscal year:

- **Current Assets:** $5,000,000
- **Current Liabilities:** $3,000,000
- **Shares Outstanding:** 500,000

The net current assets are:

\[ \text{Net Current Assets} = 5,000,000 - 3,000,000 = 2,000,000 \]

The NCAVPS is:

\[ \text{NCAVPS} = \frac{2,000,000}{500,000} = 4.00 \]

Therefore, if Company XYZ’s stock is trading at $3.00 per share, the stock is trading below its NCAVPS and may represent an undervalued opportunity.

### Example 2: A Manufacturing Firm

Consider Company ABC, a manufacturing enterprise:

- **Current Assets:** $8,000,000
- **Current Liabilities:** $2,500,000
- **Shares Outstanding:** 250,000

Calculating net current assets:

\[ \text{Net Current Assets} = 8,000,000 - 2,500,000 = 5,500,000 \]

Calculating NCAVPS:

\[ \text{NCAVPS} = \frac{5,500,000}{250,000} = 22.00 \]

If the stock of Company ABC is trading at $20.00, it is trading below its NCAVPS, which might indicate a buying opportunity.

## Modern Use Cases

In today's financial markets, NCAVPS can still be a valuable tool for discerning investors. It is particularly useful in the following scenarios:

1. **Distressed Companies:** Investors seeking opportunities in distressed or struggling companies can use NCAVPS to identify firms trading below their liquidation value.
2. **Small-Cap Stocks:** Smaller companies often have less analyst coverage, which might result in inefficiencies that careful analysis of NCAVPS can exploit.
3. **Screening Tool:** Investors can use NCAVPS as a screening tool to filter stocks that meet specific value criteria before performing detailed fundamental analysis.

### Example: Financial Screening

A financial analyst might use NCAVPS to screen a universe of stocks in the Consumer Goods sector. By filtering out stocks trading above their NCAVPS, the analyst focuses on those potential bargains, minimizing downside risk.

## Software and Tools for Calculating NCAVPS

Several financial software and platforms can help investors calculate and analyze NCAVPS:

1. **Bloomberg Terminal:** Provides comprehensive financial data and tools for calculating NCAVPS.
2. **Reuters Eikon:** Offers financial data and analytics capabilities, including the calculation of NCAVPS.
3. **Financial Websites:** Sites like Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, and MarketWatch often provide detailed financial data allowing for manual calculation of NCAVPS.
4. **Excel:** Using Excel or Google Sheets, investors can easily set up templates for calculating NCAVPS using formulae based on placeholders for current assets, current liabilities, and shares outstanding.

## Conclusion

Net Current Asset Value Per Share (NCAVPS) is a valuable metric in value investing, focusing on the intrinsic value of a company based on its net current assets. This conservative approach, championed by Benjamin Graham, helps investors identify potentially undervalued stocks, providing a margin of safety by mitigating downside risk. However, it is important to note its limitations, especially in sectors with significant intangible assets or growth potentials. Despite these constraints, NCAVPS continues to offer valuable insights for discerning value investors, particularly in small-cap and distressed stocks. For those interested in using this metric as part of their investment strategy, a range of tools and financial platforms are available to facilitate its calculation and application.

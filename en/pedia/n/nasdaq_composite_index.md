This [index](../i/index_instrument.md) includes a broad [range](../r/range.md) of sectors but is heavily [weighted](../w/weighted.md) toward technology and internet-based companies.

## Overview

Officially launched on February 8, 1971, the [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) Composite [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) was created to measure the performance of all [stocks](../s/stock.md) [listed](../l/listed.md) on the [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md). Unlike the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) or the S&P 500, which includes only select companies, the [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) Composite encompasses nearly every stock on the [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) [exchange](../e/exchange.md), thereby [offering](../o/offering.md) a more comprehensive picture of the overall [market](../m/market.md).

## Composition

The [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) Composite [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) includes various types of securities:
1. **Ordinary [Shares](../s/shares.md)**: These are the common types of [stocks](../s/stock.md) that represent ownership in a company.
2. **American Depositary [Receipts](../r/receipt.md) (ADRs)**: [Stocks](../s/stock.md) of non-U.S. companies that are traded on U.S. exchanges.
3. **[Real Estate](../r/real_estate.md) Investment Trusts (REITs)**: Companies that own, operate, or [finance](../f/finance.md) [income](../i/income.md)-producing [real estate](../r/real_estate.md).

5. **Limited Partnership Interests**: Securities representing ownership in a partnership, often utilized in industries like energy.

## Sector Weighting

While the [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) Composite includes companies from a variety of sectors, it is heavily [weighted](../w/weighted.md) toward technology, making it a key [indicator](../i/indicator.md) for the tech [industry](../i/industry.md). The sectors represented include:
- **Technology**: Software, hardware, semiconductors, and internet services.
- **Healthcare**: Biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices.

## Market Capitalization and Weighting

The [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) Composite is a [market](../m/market.md)-[capitalization](../c/capitalization.md)-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md). This means the [value](../v/value.md) of the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) is calculated by adding up the [market](../m/market.md) values of the individual companies and dividing by a divisor, which is adjusted for stock splits, dividends, and other corporate actions. Larger companies with higher [market](../m/market.md) caps have a more significant impact on the [index](../i/index_instrument.md)'s performance.

## Calculation

The [index](../i/index_instrument.md) level for the [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) Composite is calculated using a [capitalization](../c/capitalization.md)-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) methodology:
\[ \text{Index Level} = \frac{\sum (\text{[Market](../m/market.md) Cap of Company} \times \text{Stock Price})}{\text{Divisor}} \]

The divisor is subject to periodic adjustments based on corporate actions to maintain the [index](../i/index_instrument.md)'s continuity.

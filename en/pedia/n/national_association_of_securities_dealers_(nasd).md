# National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD)

The National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) was a self-regulatory organization (SRO) for the securities industry in the United States. Founded in 1939, NASD was responsible for overseeing the conduct of brokerage firms and their registered representatives, establishing and enforcing standards and rules for trading practices, and ensuring investor protection.

## History and Background

NASD was established as a result of the Maloney Act amendment to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Maloney Act authorized the creation of national securities associations that could serve as self-regulatory bodies within the securities industry, thus providing a layer of oversight beyond what could be maintained by government regulation alone.

As the first SRO created under the Maloney Act, NASD played a critical role in maintaining order and integrity in the securities markets. It was responsible for writing regulations, conducting audits and inspections, and, when necessary, enforcing penalties or sanctions for violations of its rules.

## Governance

NASD's governance structure consisted of a Board of Governors, which included industry professionals and public representatives. This balance ensured that the organization's rules and policies reflected both the needs of the securities industry and the interests of the investing public.

The organization's operations were divided into multiple departments, each focusing on specific aspects of regulation, market surveillance, and member compliance. These departments worked synergistically to maintain fair and efficient markets.

## Regulatory Functions

NASD's core responsibilities included:

- **Rulemaking**: NASD created and amended rules governing the conduct of its member firms and their employees.
- **Member Regulation**: Conducting audits, inspections, and examinations of brokerage firms to ensure compliance with NASD rules, federal securities laws, and other applicable regulations.
- **Dispute Resolution**: Offering arbitration and mediation services to resolve disputes between investors and brokerage firms or between brokerage firms themselves.
- **Market Surveillance**: Monitoring trading activities to detect and deter market manipulation, fraud, and other misconduct.

## Key Rules and Regulations

Some of the key rules and regulations enforced by NASD included:

- **Know Your Customer (KYC) Rule**: Required brokers to understand their clients' financial situations, investment experience, and risk tolerance before making recommendations.
- **Suitability Rule**: Mandated that investment recommendations be appropriate for the client's financial profile and investment objectives.
- **Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE)**: Ensured transparency in the reporting of over-the-counter (OTC) transactions in corporate bonds.
- **Conduct Rules**: Detailed the ethical standards and business practices expected of member firms, including guidelines on communications with the public, conflicts of interest, and trading practices.

## Education and Continuing Compliance

Beyond enforcement and rulemaking, NASD was also committed to educating industry professionals and investors. It developed and administered qualification examinations for registered representatives (such as the Series 7 exam) to ensure that they possessed the necessary knowledge and skills.

For ongoing compliance, NASD provided resources and training opportunities to help member firms and their employees stay up to date with regulatory changes and best practices.

## Evolution and Merger

In 2007, NASD underwent a significant transformation when it merged with the regulatory arm of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to form the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). This merger was part of an effort to streamline and enhance oversight of the securities industry by creating a single, consolidated SRO with broader authority.

FINRA inherited the regulatory functions of NASD and continues to serve as the primary SRO for securities firms operating in the United States. It carries forward NASD's mission of investor protection and market integrity within an expanded regulatory framework.

In conclusion, the National Association of Securities Dealers played a vital role in shaping the regulatory landscape of the U.S. securities industry. Its legacy continues through the work of FINRA, which remains committed to ensuring fair and transparent markets for all participants.

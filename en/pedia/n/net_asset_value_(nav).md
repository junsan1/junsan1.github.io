# Net Asset Value (NAV)
Net [Asset](../a/asset.md) [Value](../v/value.md), commonly referred to as NAV, is a financial metric that signifies the [value](../v/value.md) of an entity's assets minus the [value](../v/value.md) of its liabilities. This [value](../v/value.md) is essential for assessing the worth of mutual funds, [exchange](../e/exchange.md)-traded funds (ETFs), and closed-end funds. The NAV is typically expressed on a per-share [basis](../b/basis.md), making it an effective metric for investors to compare the performance and [value](../v/value.md) of different funds.

## Calculation of NAV
The calculation of NAV is straightforward, and it occurs on a daily [basis](../b/basis.md) for [open](../o/open.md)-end mutual funds and ETFs at the end of each trading day. The formula for NAV is as follows:

\[ \text{NAV} = \frac{\text{Total Assets} - \text{[Total Liabilities](../t/total_liabilities.md)}}{\text{Number of [Shares](../s/shares.md) Outstanding}} \]

### Components of NAV Calculation
1. **Total Assets**: This includes the [market value](../m/market_value.md) of all the securities in the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s portfolio, cash, and [cash equivalents](../c/cash_equivalents.md), receivables, and any other assets.
2. **[Total Liabilities](../t/total_liabilities.md)**: These are the [obligations](../o/obligation.md) the [fund](../f/fund.md) owes to others, such as debts, pending transactions, and other liabilities.
3. **Number of [Shares](../s/shares.md) Outstanding**: This is the total number of [shares](../s/shares.md) that are currently held by all shareholders.

### Practical Example
Letâ€™s consider an example to illustrate the calculation of NAV. Suppose a [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md) has the following:
- Total Assets: $10 million
- [Total Liabilities](../t/total_liabilities.md): $2 million
- Number of [Shares](../s/shares.md) Outstanding: 400,000 [shares](../s/shares.md)

Using the NAV formula:
\[ \text{NAV} = \frac{\text{Total Assets} - \text{[Total Liabilities](../t/total_liabilities.md)}}{\text{Number of [Shares](../s/shares.md) Outstanding}} \]
\[ \text{NAV} = \frac{10,000,000 - 2,000,000}{400,000} \]
\[ \text{NAV} = \frac{8,000,000}{400,000} \]
\[ \text{NAV} = 20 \]

Thus, the NAV per share would be $20.

## Importance of NAV in Investing
NAV serves [multiple](../m/multiple.md) functions in [investing](../i/investing.md), particularly in the context of mutual funds and ETFs:

1. **Performance Measure**: NAV provides insights into a [fund](../f/fund.md)'s performance. By comparing the NAV of different periods, investors can gauge how well a [fund](../f/fund.md) is performing.

2. **Pricing Tool**: For [open](../o/open.md)-end funds, NAV is used to price the purchase and [redemption](../r/redemption.md) of [shares](../s/shares.md). This ensures that investors buy and sell [shares](../s/shares.md) at [fair value](../f/fair_value.md).

3. **[Expense](../e/expense.md) Tracking**: The change in NAV can reflect the impact of management fees and other expenses deducted from the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s assets, helping investors understand the cost of their investment.

4. **Portfolio [Valuation](../v/valuation.md)**: NAV allows investors to determine the [value](../v/value.md) of their [holdings](../h/holdings.md) in a [fund](../f/fund.md), which is crucial for both [personal finance](../p/personal_finance_in_trading.md) management and tax purposes.

## NAV vs. Market Price
While NAV represents the [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) of [fund](../f/fund.md) [shares](../s/shares.md), the [market price](../m/market_price.md) is the price at which these [shares](../s/shares.md) [trade](../t/trade.md) in the [market](../m/market.md). These two can differ, especially in the case of ETFs and closed-end funds:

1. **ETFs**: Though ETFs typically [trade](../t/trade.md) close to their NAV, [market](../m/market.md) forces can cause slight deviations due to [supply](../s/supply.md) and [demand](../d/demand.md) dynamics.

2. **Closed-End Funds**: These funds often [trade](../t/trade.md) at a [premium](../p/premium.md) or [discount](../d/discount.md) to their NAV. A [fund](../f/fund.md) trading at a [premium](../p/premium.md) has a [market price](../m/market_price.md) higher than its NAV, while a [fund](../f/fund.md) trading at a [discount](../d/discount.md) has a [market price](../m/market_price.md) lower than its NAV.

For instance, if a [closed-end fund](../c/closed-end_fund.md) has an NAV of $30 but trades at $33, it is trading at a 10% [premium](../p/premium.md).
\[ \text{Premium} = \frac{(\text{[Market Price](../m/market_price.md)} - \text{NAV})}{\text{NAV}} \times 100 \]
\[ \text{[Premium](../p/premium.md)} = \frac{(33 - 30)}{30} \times 100 = 10\% \]

Conversely, if the [market price](../m/market_price.md) was $27, it would be trading at a 10% [discount](../d/discount.md).
\[ \text{Discount} = \frac{(\text{NAV} - \text{[Market Price](../m/market_price.md)})}{\text{NAV}} \times 100 \]
\[ \text{[Discount](../d/discount.md)} = \frac{(30 - 27)}{30} \times 100 = 10\% \]

## Factors Influencing NAV
Several factors can influence the NAV of a [fund](../f/fund.md):

1. **[Market](../m/market.md) Movements**: Changes in the [market value](../m/market_value.md) of the securities held by the [fund](../f/fund.md) directly affect its total assets.

2. **[Dividend](../d/dividend.md) Distributions**: When a [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md) distributes dividends, its NAV typically decreases by the amount distributed.

3. **New Investments and Redemptions**: For [open](../o/open.md)-end mutual funds, new investments increase the total assets and number of [shares](../s/shares.md) outstanding, while redemptions decrease them.

4. **Management Fees and Expenses**: Any fees and expenses deducted from the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s assets lower its NAV.

## NAV in Automated Trading (Algo Trading)
In the context of [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), NAV can be useful for automated models that require precise and up-to-date information about the [value](../v/value.md) of funds to make informed decisions. These models can incorporate NAV calculations to:

1. **[Arbitrage Opportunities](../a/arbitrage_opportunities.md)**: Identify [arbitrage opportunities](../a/arbitrage_opportunities.md) between the [market price](../m/market_price.md) and the NAV of ETFs and closed-end funds.
2. **[Portfolio Optimization](../p/portfolio_optimization.md)**: Balance a portfolio by considering the NAV-based [valuation](../v/valuation.md) of different funds.
3. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Manage [risk](../r/risk.md) by monitoring NAV fluctuations and adjusting positions accordingly.

# Portfolio Performance Metrics

In the realm of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) and [finance](../f/finance.md), the efficacy and health of a portfolio are judged by a wide array of [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md). These metrics help both individual investors and institutional traders assess the [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md) characteristics of their investments. This detailed exploration [will](../w/will.md) delve into key metrics, how they are calculated, and their significance in evaluating a portfolio.

## 1. Total Return

[Total Return](../t/total_return.md) measures the overall [earnings](../e/earnings.md) of a portfolio, combining [capital](../c/capital.md) gains (or losses) and [income](../i/income.md) from dividends or [interest](../i/interest.md).

**Formula:**

\[ \text{[Total Return](../t/total_return.md)} = \frac{V_{\text{final}} - V_{\text{initial}} + D}{V_{\text{initial}}} \]

Where:
- \( V_{\text{initial}} \) is the initial [value](../v/value.md) of the portfolio
- \( V_{\text{final}} \) is the final [value](../v/value.md) of the portfolio
- \( D \) is the [income](../i/income.md) from dividends or [interest](../i/interest.md)

[Total Return](../t/total_return.md) provides a comprehensive view of the portfolio’s performance, considering both price appreciation and [income](../i/income.md), making it a vital metric for long-term investors.

## 2. Annualized Return

Annualized [Return](../r/return.md) converts the [total return](../t/total_return.md) to an annualized figure, which helps compare performance across different time horizons.

**Formula:**

\[ \text{Annualized [Return](../r/return.md)} = \left( \frac{V_{\text{final}}}{V_{\text{initial}}} \right)^{\frac{1}{n}} - 1 \]

Where:
- \( n \) is the number of years

The Annualized [Return](../r/return.md) offers a standardized way to compare the [return](../r/return.md) rates over periods of differing lengths.

## 3. Volatility (Standard Deviation)

[Volatility](../v/volatility.md) measures the degree of variation in the portfolio's [return](../r/return.md) over a specific period. It generally uses [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) as a [proxy](../p/proxy.md).

**Formula:**

\[ \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (R_i - \bar{R})^2} \]

Where:
- \( \sigma \) is the [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md)
- \( R_i \) is the [return](../r/return.md) in each period
- \( \bar{R} \) is the [average return](../a/average_return.md) over the period
- \( N \) is the number of periods

[Volatility](../v/volatility.md) is crucial for understanding the [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with a portfolio, as higher [volatility](../v/volatility.md) usually indicates higher [risk](../r/risk.md).

## 4. Sharpe Ratio

The [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) measures the [risk-adjusted return](../r/risk-adjusted_return.md) of the portfolio by adjusting the [return](../r/return.md) by the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate and dividing it by the portfolio's [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md).

**Formula:**

\[ S = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_p} \]

Where:
- \( R_p \) is the [return](../r/return.md) of the portfolio
- \( R_f \) is the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate
- \( \sigma_p \) is the portfolio's [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md)

Developed by Nobel laureate [William F. Sharpe](../w/william_f._sharpe.md), this ratio helps investors understand the [return](../r/return.md) they are gaining per unit of [risk](../r/risk.md) taken.

## 5. Sortino Ratio

An improvement over the [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md), the [Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md) distinguishes between harmful [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and total [volatility](../v/volatility.md) by considering only the [downside risk](../d/downside_risk.md).

**Formula:**

\[ S = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_d} \]

Where:
- \( \sigma_d \) is the [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) of only negative returns ([downside deviation](../d/downside_deviation.md))

The [Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md) provides a clearer picture of the portfolio's performance by focusing on adverse [risk](../r/risk.md).

## 6. Beta

[Beta](../b/beta.md) measures the sensitivity of the portfolio's [return](../r/return.md) to the [return](../r/return.md) of a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [index](../i/index.md) (often the [market](../m/market.md)).

**Formula:**

\[ \[beta](../b/beta.md) = \frac{\text{Cov}(R_p, R_m)}{\text{Var}(R_m)} \]

Where:
- \( R_p \) is the portfolio [return](../r/return.md)
- \( R_m \) is the [market](../m/market.md) [return](../r/return.md)
- \( \text{Cov}(R_p, R_m) \) is the [covariance](../c/covariance.md) of the portfolio [return](../r/return.md) with the [market](../m/market.md) [return](../r/return.md)
- \( \text{Var}(R_m) \) is the variance of the [market](../m/market.md) [return](../r/return.md)

A [Beta](../b/beta.md) greater than 1 indicates higher sensitivity to [market](../m/market.md) movements, whereas a [Beta](../b/beta.md) less than 1 indicates lower sensitivity.

## 7. Alpha

[Alpha](../a/alpha.md) represents the portfolio's performance relative to a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [index](../i/index.md), adjusted for [market](../m/market.md)-related [risk](../r/risk.md) ([Beta](../b/beta.md)).

**Formula:**

\[ \[alpha](../a/alpha.md) = R_p - \left( R_f + \[beta](../b/beta.md) (R_m - R_f) \right) \]

Where:
- \( R_p \) is the portfolio [return](../r/return.md)
- \( R_f \) is the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate
- \( \[beta](../b/beta.md) \) is the portfolio [Beta](../b/beta.md)
- \( R_m \) is the [market](../m/market.md) [return](../r/return.md)

A positive [Alpha](../a/alpha.md) indicates that the portfolio has outperformed its [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md), showcasing the effectiveness of the [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md).

## 8. Information Ratio

The [Information Ratio](../i/information_ratio.md) (IR) evaluates portfolio returns above the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [return](../r/return.md), adjusted for [tracking error](../t/tracking_error.md) (the [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) of the difference between portfolio and [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) returns).

**Formula:**

\[ IR = \frac{R_p - R_b}{\sigma_e} \]

Where:
- \( R_p \) is the portfolio [return](../r/return.md)
- \( R_b \) is the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [return](../r/return.md)
- \( \sigma_e \) is the [tracking error](../t/tracking_error.md)

The [Information Ratio](../i/information_ratio.md) helps gauge the consistency and skill of the [portfolio manager](../p/portfolio_manager.md) in outperforming the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md).

## 9. Maximum Drawdown

Maximum [Drawdown](../d/drawdown.md) (MDD) measures the largest single drop from peak to [trough](../t/trough.md) in the portfolio's [value](../v/value.md).

**Formula:**

\[ \text{MDD} = \frac{\text{[Trough](../t/trough.md) [Value](../v/value.md)} - \text{Peak [Value](../v/value.md)}}{\text{Peak [Value](../v/value.md)}} \]

Maximum [Drawdown](../d/drawdown.md) provides insight into the worst-case scenario for the portfolio, showcasing its [downside risk](../d/downside_risk.md).

## 10. Calmar Ratio

The Calmar Ratio compares the portfolio’s annualized [return](../r/return.md) to its maximum [drawdown](../d/drawdown.md), providing a measure of [risk-adjusted return](../r/risk-adjusted_return.md).

**Formula:**

\[ \text{Calmar Ratio} = \frac{\text{Annualized Return}}{\text{Maximum [Drawdown](../d/drawdown.md)}} \]

This ratio helps investors evaluate the reward potential for the [risk](../r/risk.md) of substantial loss.

## 11. Treynor Ratio

The [Treynor Ratio](../t/treynor_ratio.md) measures returns earned in excess of the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free [return](../r/return.md) per unit of [market risk](../m/market_risk.md) ([Beta](../b/beta.md)).

**Formula:**

\[ \text{[Treynor Ratio](../t/treynor_ratio.md)} = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\[beta](../b/beta.md)} \]

Where:
- \( R_p \) is the portfolio [return](../r/return.md)
- \( R_f \) is the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate

The [Treynor Ratio](../t/treynor_ratio.md), like the [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md), helps in assessing [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted returns but uses [systematic risk](../s/systematic_risk.md) as the denominator.

## 12. R-Squared

[R-Squared](../r/r-squared_in_trading.md) measures the proportion of the portfolio's movement that can be explained by movements in a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [index](../i/index.md).

**Formula:**

\[ R^2 = \frac{\text{Cov}(R_p, R_b)^2}{\text{Var}(R_p) \cdot \text{Var}(R_b)} \]

Where:
- \( \text{Cov}(R_p, R_b) \) is the [covariance](../c/covariance.md) of the portfolio’s [return](../r/return.md) with the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md)’s [return](../r/return.md)
- \( \text{Var}(R_p) \) is the variance of the portfolio’s [return](../r/return.md)
- \( \text{Var}(R_b) \) is the variance of the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md)’s [return](../r/return.md)

An [R-Squared](../r/r-squared_in_trading.md) [value](../v/value.md) close to 1 indicates a high [correlation](../c/correlation.md) between the portfolio and the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md), highlighting the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md)’s explanatory power.

## 13. Jensen's Alpha

[Jensen's Alpha](../j/jensen's_alpha.md) calculates the [excess return](../e/excess_return.md) of the portfolio over the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) based on the [Capital Asset](../c/capital_asset.md) Pricing Model (CAPM).

**Formula:**

\[ \alpha_j = R_p - \left( R_f + \[beta](../b/beta.md) (R_m - R_f) \right) \]

Where:
- \( \alpha_j \) is [Jensen's Alpha](../j/jensen's_alpha.md)
- \( R_p \) is the portfolio [return](../r/return.md)
- \( R_f \) is the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate
- \( \[beta](../b/beta.md) \) is the portfolio's [Beta](../b/beta.md)
- \( R_m \) is the [market](../m/market.md) [return](../r/return.md)

[Jensen's Alpha](../j/jensen's_alpha.md) is used to measure the [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted performance and is often favored in assessing the performance of [fund](../f/fund.md) managers.

# Portfolio Performance Metrics

In the realm of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) and finance, the efficacy and health of a portfolio are judged by a wide array of [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md). These metrics help both individual investors and institutional traders assess the risk and return characteristics of their investments. This detailed exploration will delve into key metrics, how they are calculated, and their significance in evaluating a portfolio.

## 1. Total Return

Total Return measures the overall earnings of a portfolio, combining capital gains (or losses) and income from dividends or interest.

**Formula:**

\[ \text{Total Return} = \frac{V_{\text{final}} - V_{\text{initial}} + D}{V_{\text{initial}}} \]

Where:
- \( V_{\text{initial}} \) is the initial value of the portfolio
- \( V_{\text{final}} \) is the final value of the portfolio
- \( D \) is the income from dividends or interest

Total Return provides a comprehensive view of the portfolio’s performance, considering both price appreciation and income, making it a vital metric for long-term investors.

## 2. Annualized Return

Annualized Return converts the total return to an annualized figure, which helps compare performance across different time horizons.

**Formula:**

\[ \text{Annualized Return} = \left( \frac{V_{\text{final}}}{V_{\text{initial}}} \right)^{\frac{1}{n}} - 1 \]

Where:
- \( n \) is the number of years

The Annualized Return offers a standardized way to compare the return rates over periods of differing lengths.

## 3. Volatility (Standard Deviation)

Volatility measures the degree of variation in the portfolio's return over a specific period. It generally uses standard deviation as a proxy.

**Formula:**

\[ \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (R_i - \bar{R})^2} \]

Where:
- \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation
- \( R_i \) is the return in each period
- \( \bar{R} \) is the average return over the period
- \( N \) is the number of periods

Volatility is crucial for understanding the risk associated with a portfolio, as higher volatility usually indicates higher risk.

## 4. Sharpe Ratio

The [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) measures the [risk-adjusted return](../r/risk-adjusted_return.md) of the portfolio by adjusting the return by the risk-free rate and dividing it by the portfolio's standard deviation.

**Formula:**

\[ S = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_p} \]

Where:
- \( R_p \) is the return of the portfolio
- \( R_f \) is the risk-free rate
- \( \sigma_p \) is the portfolio's standard deviation

Developed by Nobel laureate William F. Sharpe, this ratio helps investors understand the return they are gaining per unit of risk taken.

## 5. Sortino Ratio

An improvement over the [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md), the [Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md) distinguishes between harmful volatility and total volatility by considering only the downside risk.

**Formula:**

\[ S = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_d} \]

Where:
- \( \sigma_d \) is the standard deviation of only negative returns ([downside deviation](../d/downside_deviation.md))

The [Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md) provides a clearer picture of the portfolio's performance by focusing on adverse risk.

## 6. Beta

Beta measures the sensitivity of the portfolio's return to the return of a benchmark index (often the market).

**Formula:**

\[ \beta = \frac{\text{Cov}(R_p, R_m)}{\text{Var}(R_m)} \]

Where:
- \( R_p \) is the portfolio return
- \( R_m \) is the market return
- \( \text{Cov}(R_p, R_m) \) is the covariance of the portfolio return with the market return
- \( \text{Var}(R_m) \) is the variance of the market return

A Beta greater than 1 indicates higher sensitivity to market movements, whereas a Beta less than 1 indicates lower sensitivity.

## 7. Alpha

Alpha represents the portfolio's performance relative to a benchmark index, adjusted for market-related risk (Beta).

**Formula:**

\[ \alpha = R_p - \left( R_f + \beta (R_m - R_f) \right) \]

Where:
- \( R_p \) is the portfolio return
- \( R_f \) is the risk-free rate
- \( \beta \) is the portfolio Beta
- \( R_m \) is the market return

A positive Alpha indicates that the portfolio has outperformed its benchmark, showcasing the effectiveness of the investment strategy.

## 8. Information Ratio

The [Information Ratio](../i/information_ratio.md) (IR) evaluates portfolio returns above the benchmark return, adjusted for tracking error (the standard deviation of the difference between portfolio and benchmark returns).

**Formula:**

\[ IR = \frac{R_p - R_b}{\sigma_e} \]

Where:
- \( R_p \) is the portfolio return
- \( R_b \) is the benchmark return
- \( \sigma_e \) is the tracking error

The [Information Ratio](../i/information_ratio.md) helps gauge the consistency and skill of the portfolio manager in outperforming the benchmark.

## 9. Maximum Drawdown

Maximum Drawdown (MDD) measures the largest single drop from peak to trough in the portfolio's value.

**Formula:**

\[ \text{MDD} = \frac{\text{Trough Value} - \text{Peak Value}}{\text{Peak Value}} \]

Maximum Drawdown provides insight into the worst-case scenario for the portfolio, showcasing its downside risk.

## 10. Calmar Ratio

The Calmar Ratio compares the portfolio’s annualized return to its maximum drawdown, providing a measure of [risk-adjusted return](../r/risk-adjusted_return.md).

**Formula:**

\[ \text{Calmar Ratio} = \frac{\text{Annualized Return}}{\text{Maximum Drawdown}} \]

This ratio helps investors evaluate the reward potential for the risk of substantial loss.

## 11. Treynor Ratio

The Treynor Ratio measures returns earned in excess of the risk-free return per unit of market risk (Beta).

**Formula:**

\[ \text{Treynor Ratio} = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\beta} \]

Where:
- \( R_p \) is the portfolio return
- \( R_f \) is the risk-free rate

The Treynor Ratio, like the [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md), helps in assessing risk-adjusted returns but uses [systematic risk](../s/systematic_risk.md) as the denominator.

## 12. R-Squared

[R-Squared](../r/r-squared_in_trading.md) measures the proportion of the portfolio's movement that can be explained by movements in a benchmark index.

**Formula:**

\[ R^2 = \frac{\text{Cov}(R_p, R_b)^2}{\text{Var}(R_p) \cdot \text{Var}(R_b)} \]

Where:
- \( \text{Cov}(R_p, R_b) \) is the covariance of the portfolio’s return with the benchmark’s return
- \( \text{Var}(R_p) \) is the variance of the portfolio’s return
- \( \text{Var}(R_b) \) is the variance of the benchmark’s return

An [R-Squared](../r/r-squared_in_trading.md) value close to 1 indicates a high correlation between the portfolio and the benchmark, highlighting the benchmark’s explanatory power.

## 13. Jensen's Alpha

[Jensen's Alpha](../j/jensen's_alpha.md) calculates the excess return of the portfolio over the expected return based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).

**Formula:**

\[ \alpha_j = R_p - \left( R_f + \beta (R_m - R_f) \right) \]

Where:
- \( \alpha_j \) is [Jensen's Alpha](../j/jensen's_alpha.md)
- \( R_p \) is the portfolio return
- \( R_f \) is the risk-free rate
- \( \beta \) is the portfolio's Beta
- \( R_m \) is the market return

[Jensen's Alpha](../j/jensen's_alpha.md) is used to measure the risk-adjusted performance and is often favored in assessing the performance of fund managers.

# Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB)

The [Public Company](../p/public_company.md) [Accounting](../a/accounting.md) Oversight Board (PCAOB) is a non-[profit](../p/profit.md) [corporation](../c/corporation.md) established by the [Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002](../s/sarbanes-oxley_(sox)_act_of_2002.md) to oversee the audits of public companies in [order](../o/order.md) to protect investors and further the public [interest](../i/interest.md) in the preparation of informative, accurate, and independent audit reports. The PCAOB also oversees the audits of brokers and dealers, including compliance reports filed pursuant to federal securities laws, to encourage accurate and reliable financial reporting and to promote [investor](../i/investor.md) protection.

### Origins and Background

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act was enacted in response to a series of high-profile financial scandals, including those affecting Enron, [WorldCom](../w/worldcom.md), and Tyco. These scandals shook public confidence in the nation's securities markets and led to a reevaluation of the reliability of corporate financial reporting and the effectiveness of the [accounting](../a/accounting.md) profession's standard-setting process. The act sets out reforms to enhance corporate responsibility, enhance financial disclosures, and combat corporate and [accounting](../a/accounting.md) [fraud](../f/fraud.md). Among its many provisions, Title I of the Act established the PCAOB.

### Mission and Responsibilities

The PCAOB's mission is multi-faceted and includes:

1. **Registering Public [Accounting](../a/accounting.md) Firms:** All firms that audit public companies are required to register with the PCAOB. This process includes the submission of information about the [firm](../f/firm.md)'s audit practices and [quality control](../q/quality_control.md) systems.
2. **Conducting Inspections:** The PCAOB conducts regular inspections of registered [accounting](../a/accounting.md) firms to assess their compliance with relevant laws, rules, and standards. These inspections evaluate various elements of a [firm](../f/firm.md)'s auditing processes, including their [quality control](../q/quality_control.md) systems and performance on selected engagements.
3. **Establishing Audit Standards:** The PCAOB is responsible for setting auditing and related professional practice standards for registered public [accounting](../a/accounting.md) firms. These standards [offer](../o/offer.md) [guidance](../g/guidance.md) on issues such as [audit risk](../a/audit_risk.md), materiality, and the application of professional skepticism.
4. **Enforcement:** The PCAOB has the authority to investigate and discipline registered [accounting](../a/accounting.md) firms and associated persons for non-compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, PCAOB rules, professional standards, and securities laws as they relate to the preparation and issuance of audit reports.
5. **International Collaboration:** The PCAOB collaborates with audit regulators and standard-setters in other countries to enhance the quality and consistency of auditing practices worldwide, recognizing the global nature of [capital markets](../c/capital_markets.md).

### Organizational Structure

The PCAOB is governed by a five-member Board, with each member being appointed to staggered terms by the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC). The SEC also has oversight authority over the PCAOB, including the approval of the Board's rules, standards, and [budget](../b/budget.md).

### Key Activities

#### Inspections

The inspection process is a cornerstone of the PCAOB's regulatory activities. Inspections provide insight into the effectiveness of a [firm](../f/firm.md)'s [quality control](../q/quality_control.md) systems and the quality of selected engagements. The PCAOB publishes inspection reports that summarize its findings, though individual [firm](../f/firm.md) reports may contain detailed descriptions of issues identified during inspections.

#### Standards

The PCAOB sets standards for audit professionals in the form of Auditing Standards (AS), which provide [guidance](../g/guidance.md) on the performance of an audit and the issuance of an audit report. Standards are developed through a public process which includes research, consultation with various stakeholders, and public comment.

#### Enforcement

When the PCAOB identifies violations of its rules or standards, it has the authority to impose sanctions which may include fines, censure, and barring individuals from participating in audits of public companies. Enforcement actions serve both as a mechanism to correct behavior and as a deterrent to others.

### Impact and Criticisms

The establishment of the PCAOB represented a significant shift in the regulation of the accountancy profession, moving away from self-regulation towards independent oversight. As a result, the quality and reliability of audit processes have seen substantial enhancements, contributing positively to [investor](../i/investor.md) confidence and [market](../m/market.md) stability.

However, the PCAOB has faced criticisms regarding its effectiveness and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md). Some stakeholders argue that inspection reports often lag behind the audit periods they cover, potentially reducing their relevance. Moreover, there has been debate over the opacity of the inspection process and calls for greater [transparency](../t/transparency.md).

### Recent Developments

The PCAOB continues to evolve in response to changes in the economic environment, advancements in technology, and emerging risks. Recent developments include greater emphasis on firms' use of third-party service providers, enhancements to [risk](../r/risk.md)-based inspection processes, and attention to audit issues related to cybersecurity and other complex areas.

In recent years, the PCAOB has also placed greater emphasis on improving the timeliness of its reports and has taken steps to enhance its enforcement activities.

Through its registration, inspection, standard-setting, and enforcement activities, the PCAOB continues to adapt to the evolving landscape of global [finance](../f/finance.md).

# Pip

In the context of [finance](../f/finance.md) and trading, particularly in [foreign exchange (forex) trading](../f/foreign_exchange_(forex)_trading.md), a pip (short for "percentage in point" or "price [interest](../i/interest.md) point") is a standardized unit of measurement that denotes the smallest price movement that a given [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) can make. It is essential for traders to understand how pips work because they are frequently used to quantify price changes and to measure the magnitude of profits and losses in trades.

## Definition and Usage

### Basic Definition

A pip is traditionally considered the smallest price increment that a [currency exchange](../c/currency_exchange.md) rate can change, and it is usually equivalent to 1/100th of 1% or 0.0001. In the forex [market](../m/market.md), where prices are typically quoted to four decimal places, the last digit of this [quote](../q/quote.md) represents a pip movement. For instance, if the EUR/USD pair moves from 1.1000 to 1.1001, this one pip movement (0.0001) reflects the smallest possible change in the pair's [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md).

### Importance in Forex Trading

Understanding pips is crucial for forex traders for several reasons:

1. **[Profit](../p/profit.md) and Loss Calculation**: Pips are the [basis](../b/basis.md) for calculating profits and losses. For example, if you bought the EUR/USD at 1.1000 and sold it at 1.1010, this 10 pip move would determine your [profit](../p/profit.md) (excluding other factors like [spreads](../s/spreads.md) and commissions).
  
2. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Pips are used to define [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) strategies, such as stop-loss and take-[profit](../p/profit.md) levels. Determining how many pips you are willing to [risk](../r/risk.md) or aiming to [gain](../g/gain.md) helps in setting these critical [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) tools.
  
3. **Brokerage Costs**: Most brokerage fees in forex are based on the spread, which is the difference between the [bid and ask](../b/bid_and_ask.md) prices, typically quoted in pips. Thus, understanding pips helps in evaluating the cost of trading through different brokers.

### Variations in Pip Value

While the 1/100th of a cent is standard for most [currency](../c/currency.md) pairs, exceptions exist for some types of traders and certain [currency](../c/currency.md) pairs:

- **JPY Pairs**: For [currency](../c/currency.md) pairs that include the Japanese yen (e.g., USD/JPY), the second decimal point is typically considered the pip. Therefore, a movement from 105.60 to 105.61 constitutes a one pip change, translating to 0.01 in [value](../v/value.md).
  
- **Fractional Pips**: Some brokers also [offer](../o/offer.md) "fractional pips" or "pipettes," which are 1/10th of a standard pip. This allows for more precise measurements and tighter [spreads](../s/spreads.md). For EUR/USD, this would mean quoting prices to five decimal places (e.g., 1.10005).

## Calculation of Pip Value

### Standard Lot Size

Generally, pip values can be translated into monetary [value](../v/value.md) based on the lot size. In forex, a standard lot equals 100,000 units of the base [currency](../c/currency.md). For most major pairs, one pip [value](../v/value.md) for one standard lot is approximately $10. This is because a movement of one pip in a full-sized lot translates into a $10 move:

Example:
- If you [trade](../t/trade.md) the EUR/USD with a standard lot and the [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) moves 1 pip (from 1.1000 to 1.1001), the [profit](../p/profit.md) or loss would be $10. 

### Mini and Micro Lots

Apart from standard lots, forex trading also uses mini and micro lots:
- **Mini lot**: Equals 10,000 units of the base [currency](../c/currency.md), where the [value](../v/value.md) of one pip is $1.
- **Micro lot**: Equals 1,000 units of the base [currency](../c/currency.md), where the [value](../v/value.md) of one pip is $0.10.

### Pip Calculation Formula

To calculate the monetary [value](../v/value.md) of a pip movement, you can use the following formula for pairs where USD is not the [quote currency](../q/quote_currency.md):

\[ \text{Pip Value} = \frac{1 \text{ Pip}} { \text{[Exchange Rate](../e/exchange_rate.md)}} \times \text{Lot Size} \]

For pairs where the USD is the [quote currency](../q/quote_currency.md) and not involved in the [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md):

\[ \text{Pip Value} = \frac{1 \text{ Pip}} { \text{Cross [Exchange Rate](../e/exchange_rate.md)}} \times \text{Lot Size} \]

For instance, if you're trading EUR/GBP:

1. Determine the [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md): Suppose it is 0.85000.
   
2. Calculate:

\[ \text{Pip [Value](../v/value.md)} = \frac{0.0001} {0.85000} \times 100,000 \approx 11.76 \text{ GBP per pip per standard lot} \]

## Practical Applications

### Trading Strategies

Understanding and applying pip values is essential for executing various [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md):
- **[Scalping](../s/scalping.md)**: A strategy that involves making small profits off small price changes, often in pips. Scalpers may conduct [multiple](../m/multiple.md) trades in a day, earning a few pips each time.

- **[Swing Trading](../s/swing_trading.md)**: Swing traders aim to capture potential price movements over several days or weeks, engaging in trades that move hundreds of pips.

### Risk Assessment

Proper pip measurement equips traders with the ability to conduct [robust](../r/robust.md) [risk](../r/risk.md) assessments. For instance:
- **[Stop-loss Orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md)**: By setting a [stop-loss order](../s/stop-loss_order.md) at a certain number of pips away from the entry price, traders can cap their potential losses.
  
- **Take-[Profit](../p/profit.md) Orders**: Conversely, take-[profit](../p/profit.md) orders can be set at a specific number of pips away from the entry price to [lock in profits](../l/lock_in_profits.md) at a predetermined level.

### Trading Platforms

Modern trading platforms make it easier to keep track of pip values and price changes. Platforms like MetaTrader 4, MetaTrader 5, and proprietary [broker](../b/broker.md) interfaces display pip movements and may even provide tools for automated pip management in [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

## Institutional Use

### Algorithmic Trading

Algorithmic traders, who use automated systems to execute trades based on predefined criteria, also rely heavily on pips for programming their [trading rules](../t/trading_rules.md). An algorithm may be designed to enter a position after a certain pip movement, set stop-loss and take-[profit](../p/profit.md) levels in pips, and exit positions based on pip-based criteria.

### High-Frequency Trading (HFT)

High-frequency traders, who focus on executing a large number of orders within very short timeframes, often deal with fractions of pips. The precision in pip movements allows HFT algorithms to detect and exploit tiny [arbitrage opportunities](../a/arbitrage_opportunities.md) in milliseconds.

## Conclusion

Understanding the concept of pips is fundamental for anyone engaged in forex trading. It serves as the basic unit of measurement for price change, essential for calculating profits and losses, and integral for [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) strategies. Whether you are a retail [trader](../t/trader.md) or an institutional participant using advanced [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md), grasping the importance and calculation of pips can significantly impact your trading effectiveness and profitability.

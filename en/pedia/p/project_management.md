# Project Management

Project Management is a disciplined approach towards planning, organizing, and managing resources to achieve specific goals and meet specific success criteria at a specified time. The primary challenge of project management is to achieve all of the project goals within the given constraints. This information is usually described in project documentation, created at the beginning of the development process. The primary constraints are [scope](../s/scope.md), time, and [budget](../b/budget.md). The secondary challenge is to optimize the allocation and integration of inputs necessary to meet pre-defined objectives.

## Key Concepts in Project Management

### Project Lifecycle

The project lifecycle refers to the series of phases that a project passes through from its initiation to its closure. These phases typically include:

1. **Initiation**: Defining the project, its purpose, and its [scope](../s/scope.md).
2. **Planning**: Detailing the tasks, timeline, and resources required.
3. **[Execution](../e/execution.md)**: Carrying out the project plan.
4. **Monitoring and Controlling**: Tracking the project performance and making adjustments as necessary.
5. **Closure**: Finalizing all activities and formally closing the project.

### Project Scope

The project [scope](../s/scope.md) defines what the project [will](../w/will.md) deliver and the work that needs to be done to deliver the project's outcomes. It includes:

- **Objectives**: The specific goals that the project aims to achieve.
- **[Deliverables](../d/deliverables.md)**: Tangible or intangible products or services that are expected to be produced from the project.
- **Tasks**: The activities or work that needs to be done in [order](../o/order.md) to produce the [deliverables](../d/deliverables.md).

### Project Planning

Project planning is the phase where the project plans are documented, the project [deliverables](../d/deliverables.md) and requirements are defined, and the project schedule is created. Key activities include:

- **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**: Breaking down the project into smaller, more manageable components.
- **[Gantt Chart](../g/gantt_chart.md)**: Visualizing the project schedule.
- **Resource Allocation**: Assigning necessary resources to different project tasks.

### Risk Management

[Risk management](../r/risk_management.md) involves identifying, assessing, and managing risks to ensure that potential project issues do not become real obstacles. This includes:

- **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Identification**: Determining which risks might affect the project.
- **[Risk Analysis](../r/risk_analysis.md)**: Evaluating the impact and likeliness of risks.
- **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Mitigation**: Planning responses to minimize adverse impacts.

### Stakeholder Management

Stakeholders are individuals or groups that have an [interest](../i/interest.md) in the project's outcome. Effective [stakeholder](../s/stakeholder.md) management involves:

- **Identification**: Recognizing all the individuals and groups that may affect or be affected by the project.
- **Engagement**: Communicating and working with stakeholders to meet their needs and address issues as they occur.
- **Expectation Management**: Ensuring that stakeholders’ expectations are in line with the project’s [scope](../s/scope.md) and objectives.

### Financial Management

Financial management in project management involves the planning, organizing, directing, and controlling of financial undertakings in a project. Key aspects include:

- **Budgeting**: Estimating the financial resources required for the project.
- **Cost Management**: Monitoring and controlling project expenses to ensure it stays within [budget](../b/budget.md).
- **Financial Reporting**: Providing financial reports to stakeholders.

### Project Tools

There are several tools that can assist in project management, including software applications designed to help with planning, scheduling, resource allocation, and change management. Examples include:

- **Microsoft Project**: A project management software product.
- **Trello**: A collaboration tool that organizes your projects into boards.
- **Asana**: A web and mobile app designed to help teams organize, track, and manage their work.
- **JIRA**: An [issue](../i/issue.md) and project tracking software.

### Methodologies

Various project management methodologies exist, each suited for different types of projects and industries:

- **Waterfall**: A linear and sequential approach.
- **Agile**: A flexible and iterative approach, particularly suited for software development.
- **Scrum**: An Agile framework focused on delivering small increments of work.
- **[Kanban](../k/kanban.md)**: A visual approach to managing work as it moves through a process.

### Certifications

Certifications can verify a project manager's expertise and credibility. Some recognized certifications include:

- **Project Management Professional (PMP)**: Offered by the Project Management Institute (PMI).
- **PRINCE2 (Projects IN Controlled Environments)**: A methodology and certification in project management.
- **Certified ScrumMaster (CSM)**: Offered by Scrum Alliance for Scrum methodology practitioners.

## Advanced Topics in Project Management

### Lean Project Management

Lean Project Management focuses on eliminating waste and optimizing processes. It emphasizes delivering more [value](../v/value.md) to customers with fewer resources by streamlining workflow and improving [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md). Key principles include:

- **[Value](../v/value.md)**: Understanding what [value](../v/value.md) means to the [customer](../c/customer.md).
- **[Value](../v/value.md) Stream**: Identifying and mapping all steps in the process.
- **Flow**: Ensuring the process runs smoothly without interruptions.
- **Pull**: Producing only what is needed, when it is needed.
- **Continuous Improvement ([Kaizen](../k/kaizen.md))**: Always seeking ways to improve the process.

### Six Sigma

[Six Sigma](../s/six_sigma.md) is a set of techniques and tools for process improvement aimed at reducing defects and [variability](../v/variability.md). It employs the DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) framework. Specific levels of expertise, often denoted as "belts" like in martial arts, signify proficiency in [Six Sigma](../s/six_sigma.md) methodologies.

### Hybrid Project Management

Combining elements from different project management methodologies to suit the specific needs of the project. This approach allows for greater flexibility and adaptability by integrating structured methodologies like Waterfall with flexible methodologies like Agile.

### Project Portfolio Management (PPM)

PPM involves managing a collection of projects in a coordinated way to achieve strategic objectives. It focuses on assessing, prioritizing, and managing [multiple](../m/multiple.md) projects, ensuring they align with the organizational goals. Key components include:

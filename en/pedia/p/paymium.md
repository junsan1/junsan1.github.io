## History

### Founding and Early Years

Established in 2011 by Pierre Noizat and Gonzague Grandval, Paymium was originally known as "[Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md)-Central." The founders recognized the potential of [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) and [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology early on and aimed to create a secure and efficient platform where users could [trade](../t/trade.md) [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) against the [euro](../e/euro.md).

### Rebranding and Growth

During this period, Paymium also became the first [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) [exchange](../e/exchange.md) to comply with the EU regulations on AML (Anti-[Money Laundering](../m/money_laundering.md)) and KYC (Know Your [Customer](../c/customer.md)), setting a precedent for the [industry](../i/industry.md).

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

To further safeguard user accounts, Paymium offers two-[factor](../f/factor.md) authentication. Users can opt to receive authentication codes via SMS or through authentication apps, adding an extra layer of [security](../s/security.md) to the login process.

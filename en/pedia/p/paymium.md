## History

### Founding and Early Years

Established in 2011 by Pierre Noizat and Gonzague Grandval, Paymium was originally known as "Bitcoin-Central." The founders recognized the potential of Bitcoin and blockchain technology early on and aimed to create a secure and efficient platform where users could trade Bitcoin against the euro.

### Rebranding and Growth

In 2013, the platform underwent a rebranding process and adopted the name Paymium. This change signified the company's broader ambition to integrate more financial services into its offerings. During this period, Paymium also became the first Bitcoin exchange to comply with the EU regulations on AML (Anti-Money Laundering) and KYC (Know Your Customer), setting a precedent for the industry.

### Technological Milestones

Over the years, Paymium has introduced several technological advancements to improve user experience and platform security. For instance, the implementation of multisignature wallets and SSL encryption has significantly enhanced the safety of transactions and user data.

## Security Measures

### Cold Storage

A significant portion of user funds is kept in cold storage wallets, which are not connected to the internet. This measure greatly reduces the risk of hacking and unauthorized access. Only a small percentage of funds are stored in hot wallets to facilitate day-to-day trading activities.

### Multisignature Wallets

Paymium employs multisignature technology for its wallets, requiring multiple keys to authorize a transaction. This adds an additional layer of security, ensuring that even if one key is compromised, the funds remain secure.

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

To further safeguard user accounts, Paymium offers two-factor authentication. Users can opt to receive authentication codes via SMS or through authentication apps, adding an extra layer of security to the login process.

### Regulatory Compliance

Being a European platform, Paymium adheres to all relevant EU regulations, including AML (Anti-Money Laundering) and KYC (Know Your Customer) policies. Users are required to submit identity verification documents before they can engage in trading activities, ensuring that the platform operates within legal boundaries.

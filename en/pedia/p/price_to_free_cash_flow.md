# Price to Free Cash Flow

Price to Free [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md) (P/FCF) is a [valuation](../v/valuation.md) metric that investors use to evaluate the attractiveness of an investment in a company's stock. This ratio compares the price of a company's stock to its free [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md). Free [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md) (FCF) is the amount of cash a company generates after [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for [capital](../c/capital.md) expenditures needed to maintain or expand its [asset](../a/asset.md) base. It is an important [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and a company's ability to generate profits and [fund](../f/fund.md) operations without relying on external [financing](../f/financing.md).

## Key Concepts and Definitions

### Price (P)
The "Price" component in the Price to Free [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md) ratio refers to the [market price](../m/market_price.md) of a company's stock. This is the [value](../v/value.md) at which the stock is currently trading on the [stock market](../s/stock_market.md). For example, if a company's stock is trading at $50 per share, then the "Price" part of the ratio is $50.

### Free Cash Flow (FCF)
Free [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md) is calculated by taking the operating [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) of a company (cash generated from its regular [business](../b/business.md) operations) and subtracting [capital](../c/capital.md) expenditures ([money](../m/money.md) spent on maintaining or growing its assets). The formula is:

\[
\text{Free [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md)} = \text{Operating [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md)} - \text{[Capital](../c/capital.md) Expenditures}
\]

Operating [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) can be found on the company's [cash flow statement](../c/cash_flow_statement.md) and represents the cash generated from the company's primary [business activities](../b/business_activities.md). [Capital](../c/capital.md) expenditures, also found on the [cash flow statement](../c/cash_flow_statement.md), include expenses related to purchasing, maintaining, or improving fixed assets such as buildings or equipment.

### Price to Free Cash Flow Ratio (P/FCF)
This ratio is calculated by dividing the [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) (or the stock price on a per-share [basis](../b/basis.md)) by the free [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) on a per-share [basis](../b/basis.md). The formula on a per-share [basis](../b/basis.md) is:

\[
\text{Price to Free [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md) Ratio} = \frac{\text{Price per Share}}{\text{Free [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md) per Share}}
\]

### Interpretation of P/FCF Ratio
A lower P/FCF ratio may indicate that the stock is [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) or that the company is generating a good amount of free [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) relative to its stock price. Conversely, a higher P/FCF ratio might suggest that the stock is [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md) or that the company has lower free [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) relative to its [market price](../m/market_price.md). 

## Why P/FCF is Important

### Assessing Financial Health
Free [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md) is a direct measure of a company's [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and its ability to generate cash. Unlike net [income](../i/income.md), which can be affected by non-cash items such as [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) and amortization, FCF provides a clear picture of the cash that the company has at its disposal. 

### Financing Growth
Companies with strong free [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) are better positioned to [finance](../f/finance.md) [expansion](../e/expansion.md), invest in new projects, pay dividends, and reduce [debt](../d/debt.md) without having to rely on external [financing](../f/financing.md) sources.

### Comparisons Across Industries
By using the P/FCF ratio, investors can compare companies across different sectors and industries, as FCF is a universal measure of [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md).

## Limitations of P/FCF

### Capital Intensive Industries
In industries with high [capital expenditure](../c/capital_expenditure.md) needs, such as [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) or utilities, companies might have lower free [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md), making the P/FCF ratio appear less attractive. However, this does not necessarily mean the company is performing poorly.

### Cyclical Variations
Free [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md) can be highly cyclical, particularly for companies in industries like retail or tourism, where cash flows fluctuate significantly based on seasons or [economic cycles](../e/economic_cycles.md).

### Manipulation of Cash Flow
Companies might manipulate [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) figures through timing of [capital](../c/capital.md) expenditures or by adjusting working [capital](../c/capital.md) components. Investors should be cautious and look at other corroborative metrics to get a more comprehensive picture.

## Example Calculation

Suppose Company X is trading at $200 per share, and its free [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) per share is $10. The P/FCF ratio would be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{P/FCF} = \frac{200}{10} = 20
\]

This means that for every dollar of free [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md), investors are willing to pay $20.

## Practical Applications

### Investment Decisions
Investors might use the P/FCF as one of the key metrics to decide whether to invest in a particular stock. A low P/FCF ratio might indicate a buying opportunity.

### Comparing Companies
When comparing two companies in the same [industry](../i/industry.md), the one with a lower P/FCF ratio could be considered more attractive, assuming other factors are constant.

### Monitoring Financial Health
Analysts and investors often track the P/FCF ratio over time to monitor the [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and performance of a company. A declining P/FCF ratio might signal trouble, while an improving ratio could indicate growing financial strength.

## Example from the Real World

Let's consider a hypothetical analysis of companies in the tech sector. Suppose we have two companies, TechCorp and InnovateInc.

- **TechCorp:**
  - Stock Price: $150
  - Free [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md) per Share: $7
  - P/FCF Ratio: \( \frac{150}{7} \approx 21.43 \)

- **InnovateInc:**
  - Stock Price: $200
  - Free [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md) per Share: $5
  - P/FCF Ratio: \( \frac{200}{5} = 40 \)

From this comparison, we can see that TechCorp has a lower P/FCF ratio (21.43) compared to InnovateInc (40). All else being equal, TechCorp might be considered the more attractive investment based on this metric alone, as investors are paying less for every dollar of free [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md).

In conclusion, the Price to Free [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md) ratio is a crucial [valuation](../v/valuation.md) metric that provides insights into a company's [financial health](../f/financial_health.md), [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), and investment potential. While it has its limitations, when used in conjunction with other [financial ratios](../f/financial_ratios.md) and metrics, it can provide a more comprehensive understanding for investors seeking to make informed decisions.

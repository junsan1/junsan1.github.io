# Pattern Day Trader Rules

In the United States, [day trading](../d/day_trading.md) is defined as the buying and selling of the same security on the same day in a margin account. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ([FINRA](../f/finra.md)) has established particular rules and requirements for traders who engage in [day trading](../d/day_trading.md) activities, specifically those who fall under the category of Pattern Day Traders (PDT). These rules are designed to mitigate risk and ensure that traders have enough capital in their accounts to cover the frequent trades that they execute.

## Defining Pattern Day Trader

A Pattern Day Trader (PDT) is any trader who executes four or more day trades within a rolling five-business-day period in a margin account. It's essential to note that it's not the number of shares or contracts traded that characterizes a PDT, but rather the number of trades. For example, if a trader buys and sells the same stock three times in one day, those would count as three trades.

Once a trader is classified as a PDT, they are subject to specific regulatory requirements and must adhere to the rules established by [FINRA](../f/finra.md).

## The $25,000 Minimum Equity Requirement

One of the primary rules for Pattern Day Traders is the minimum equity requirement. As per [FINRA](../f/finra.md) regulations, a PDT must maintain a minimum of $25,000 in their margin account at all times on any day that the customer day trades. The $25,000 must be in the form of cash or securities.

If the account value falls below this threshold, the trader will be prohibited from [day trading](../d/day_trading.md) until the minimum equity level is restored either through depositing additional cash or securities, or by selling existing positions (not exceeding the [day trading](../d/day_trading.md) limits).

### Maintenance of $25,000 Equity

The $25,000 equity balance isn't checked just periodically; rather, it must be maintained every day. If a trader’s equity falls below $25,000, they will receive a day trade margin call. This call must be met within five business days, and until the margin call is satisfied, the account will be restricted from making further day trades.

## The 90-Day Freeze

Another consequence of falling afoul of the PDT rules is the so-called "90-day freeze." If a trader with less than $25,000 in equity executes a fourth day trade within the five business days, their account may be restricted to closing transactions only for a period of 90 days. This is a significant deterrent from violating the $25,000 requirement and can severely impact a trader's ability to operate in the market.

### Lift of the 90-Day Freeze

To lift the 90-day freeze, traders must either wait until the restriction expires or deposit sufficient funds to bring their account equity above $25,000.

## Margin Calls and Buying Power

Margin accounts are used by traders to increase their buying power by borrowing from their brokerage against the value of their securities. For day traders, the buying power is four times the account value minus the initial margin requirement.

If a trader’s equity falls below the required level due to losses, a margin call may be issued. Failure to respond to this margin call can result in a forced liquidation of the trader’s positions by the brokerage to cover the call.

### Day Trading Buying Power

[Day trading](../d/day_trading.md) buying power is defined as four times the trader's maintenance margin excess, which means that if a trader has $25,000 in their margin account, they can day trade up to $100,000 worth of securities on any given day.

However, if this buying power is exceeded, the trader will receive a Reg T margin call and must deposit funds to bring their account into compliance. This action must be taken within a specified time frame, usually five business days.

## Monitoring and Brokerage Requirements

[FINRA](../f/finra.md) regulations require brokers to monitor their clients' activities to identify patterns characteristic of a PDT. If a client is identified as a PDT, the brokerage must enforce the [FINRA](../f/finra.md) rules appropriately. This includes ensuring the $25,000 minimum equity requirement is met, managing margin calls, and restricting trading activities if necessary.

### Broker's Responsibility

Brokerages are required to provide reports to [FINRA](../f/finra.md) that detail the trading activities of their clients. They must also notify clients when they are designated as PDTs and explain the implications of this designation.

Moreover, brokers must offer trading platforms and tools that allow clients to track their day trades, account balances, and compliance with PDT regulations. This transparency is vital in helping traders manage their activities and adhere to regulatory requirements.

## Consequences of Non-Compliance

Violating PDT rules can result in several adverse consequences, including trading restrictions, margin calls, and potential liquidation of assets. These measures are designed to protect both the trader and the brokerage from excessive risk and potential financial loss.

### Potential Fines and Penalties

While typically, non-compliance results in trading restrictions or account freezes, there are scenarios where more severe penalties, including fines, can be levied. These penalties usually come into play if there is a pattern of persistent violations, misuse of margin, or evidence of fraudulent activity.

## Strategies to Avoid PDT Restrictions

Due to the strict requirements and potential account freezes under the PDT rules, many retail traders look for strategies to avoid being classified as a Pattern Day Trader.

### Swing Trading

One popular strategy is [swing trading](../s/swing_trading.md), which involves holding positions for more than one day to avoid the day trade designation. While [swing trading](../s/swing_trading.md) can carry overnight risk, it does not count as [day trading](../d/day_trading.md), thereby not affecting the PDT calculation.

### Cash Account Trading

Traders can also consider using a cash account rather than a margin account. In a cash account, traders can only use settled funds for trading, which typically takes two business days after a sell to settle. This naturally limits the frequency of trading and helps avoid PDT rules, but it also restricts the trader’s capability to leverage and execute rapid trades.

## Advanced Considerations and Loopholes

### Trade Journals and Software

Maintaining a detailed trade journal and utilizing advanced trade tracking software can help traders methodically plan their trades and ensure they stay within the regulatory limits. Software can provide real-time data, alerts, and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) tools to prevent inadvertently crossing PDT thresholds.

### Offshore Accounts

Although risky and not recommended for most traders, some might consider opening brokerage accounts with firms outside of U.S. jurisdiction where PDT rules do not apply. However, such a strategy can present significant risks, including regulatory, legal, and operational risks.

### Order Splitting and Staggered Trade Execution

Another nuanced strategy involves order splitting and staggered trade execution, essentially breaking up trades into smaller orders, executed over days rather than within a single day, to avoid the [day trading](../d/day_trading.md) classification.

## Conclusion

Pattern Day Trader Rules are an essential component of the U.S. financial regulatory framework designed to control risk in the realm of [day trading](../d/day_trading.md). While these rules impose significant requirements and restrictions, they play a crucial role in maintaining market integrity and protecting both traders and brokerages from undue risk. Understanding and adhering to these rules is vital for anyone engaging in [day trading](../d/day_trading.md) activities in a margin account.

# Pattern Day Trader Rules

In the United States, [day trading](../d/day_trading.md) is defined as the buying and selling of the same [security](../s/security.md) on the same day in a [margin account](../m/margin_account.md). The Financial [Industry](../i/industry.md) Regulatory Authority ([FINRA](../f/finra.md)) has established particular rules and requirements for traders who engage in [day trading](../d/day_trading.md) activities, specifically those who fall under the category of Pattern Day Traders (PDT). These rules are designed to mitigate [risk](../r/risk.md) and ensure that traders have enough [capital](../c/capital.md) in their accounts to cover the frequent trades that they execute.

## Defining Pattern Day Trader

A [Pattern Day Trader](../p/pattern_day_trader.md) (PDT) is any [trader](../t/trader.md) who executes four or more day trades within a rolling five-[business](../b/business.md)-day period in a [margin account](../m/margin_account.md). It's essential to [note](../n/note.md) that it's not the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) or contracts traded that characterizes a PDT, but rather the number of trades. For example, if a [trader](../t/trader.md) buys and sells the same stock three times in one day, those would count as three trades.

Once a [trader](../t/trader.md) is classified as a PDT, they are subject to specific regulatory requirements and must adhere to the rules established by [FINRA](../f/finra.md).

## The $25,000 Minimum Equity Requirement

One of the primary rules for Pattern Day Traders is the minimum [equity](../e/equity.md) requirement. As per [FINRA](../f/finra.md) regulations, a PDT must maintain a minimum of $25,000 in their [margin account](../m/margin_account.md) at all times on any day that the [customer](../c/customer.md) day trades. The $25,000 must be in the form of cash or securities.

If the account [value](../v/value.md) falls below this threshold, the [trader](../t/trader.md) [will](../w/will.md) be prohibited from [day trading](../d/day_trading.md) until the minimum [equity](../e/equity.md) level is restored either through depositing additional cash or securities, or by selling existing positions (not exceeding the [day trading](../d/day_trading.md) limits).

### Maintenance of $25,000 Equity

The $25,000 [equity](../e/equity.md) balance isn't checked just periodically; rather, it must be maintained every day. If a [trader](../t/trader.md)’s [equity](../e/equity.md) falls below $25,000, they [will](../w/will.md) receive a day [trade](../t/trade.md) [margin call](../m/margin_call.md). This call must be met within five [business](../b/business.md) days, and until the [margin call](../m/margin_call.md) is satisfied, the account [will](../w/will.md) be restricted from making further day trades.

## The 90-Day Freeze

Another consequence of falling afoul of the PDT rules is the so-called "90-day freeze." If a [trader](../t/trader.md) with less than $25,000 in [equity](../e/equity.md) executes a fourth day [trade](../t/trade.md) within the five [business](../b/business.md) days, their account may be restricted to closing transactions only for a period of 90 days. This is a significant deterrent from violating the $25,000 requirement and can severely impact a [trader](../t/trader.md)'s ability to operate in the [market](../m/market.md).

### Lift of the 90-Day Freeze

To lift the 90-day freeze, traders must either wait until the restriction expires or [deposit](../d/deposit.md) sufficient funds to bring their account [equity](../e/equity.md) above $25,000.

## Margin Calls and Buying Power

[Margin](../m/margin.md) accounts are used by traders to increase their [buying power](../b/buying_power.md) by borrowing from their brokerage against the [value](../v/value.md) of their securities. For day traders, the [buying power](../b/buying_power.md) is four times the account [value](../v/value.md) minus the [initial margin](../i/initial_margin.md) requirement.

If a [trader](../t/trader.md)’s [equity](../e/equity.md) falls below the required level due to losses, a [margin call](../m/margin_call.md) may be issued. Failure to respond to this [margin call](../m/margin_call.md) can result in a forced [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md) of the [trader](../t/trader.md)’s positions by the brokerage to cover the call.

### Day Trading Buying Power

[Day trading](../d/day_trading.md) [buying power](../b/buying_power.md) is defined as four times the [trader](../t/trader.md)'s [maintenance margin](../m/maintenance_margin.md) excess, which means that if a [trader](../t/trader.md) has $25,000 in their [margin account](../m/margin_account.md), they can day [trade](../t/trade.md) up to $100,000 worth of securities on any given day.

However, if this [buying power](../b/buying_power.md) is exceeded, the [trader](../t/trader.md) [will](../w/will.md) receive a Reg T [margin call](../m/margin_call.md) and must [deposit](../d/deposit.md) funds to bring their account into compliance. This action must be taken within a specified time frame, usually five [business](../b/business.md) days.

## Monitoring and Brokerage Requirements

[FINRA](../f/finra.md) regulations require brokers to monitor their clients' activities to identify patterns characteristic of a PDT. If a client is identified as a PDT, the brokerage must enforce the [FINRA](../f/finra.md) rules appropriately. This includes ensuring the $25,000 minimum [equity](../e/equity.md) requirement is met, managing [margin](../m/margin.md) calls, and restricting trading activities if necessary.

### Broker's Responsibility

Brokerages are required to provide reports to [FINRA](../f/finra.md) that detail the trading activities of their clients. They must also notify clients when they are designated as PDTs and explain the implications of this designation.

Moreover, brokers must [offer](../o/offer.md) trading platforms and tools that allow clients to track their day trades, account balances, and compliance with PDT regulations. This [transparency](../t/transparency.md) is vital in helping traders manage their activities and adhere to regulatory requirements.

## Consequences of Non-Compliance

Violating PDT rules can result in several adverse consequences, including trading restrictions, [margin](../m/margin.md) calls, and potential [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md) of assets. These measures are designed to protect both the [trader](../t/trader.md) and the brokerage from excessive [risk](../r/risk.md) and potential financial loss.

### Potential Fines and Penalties

While typically, non-compliance results in trading restrictions or account freezes, there are scenarios where more severe penalties, including fines, can be levied. These penalties usually come into play if there is a pattern of persistent violations, misuse of [margin](../m/margin.md), or evidence of fraudulent activity.

## Strategies to Avoid PDT Restrictions

Due to the strict requirements and potential account freezes under the PDT rules, many retail traders look for strategies to avoid being classified as a [Pattern Day Trader](../p/pattern_day_trader.md).

### Swing Trading

One popular strategy is [swing trading](../s/swing_trading.md), which involves holding positions for more than one day to avoid the day [trade](../t/trade.md) designation. While [swing trading](../s/swing_trading.md) can carry overnight [risk](../r/risk.md), it does not count as [day trading](../d/day_trading.md), thereby not affecting the PDT calculation.

### Cash Account Trading

Traders can also consider using a cash account rather than a [margin account](../m/margin_account.md). In a cash account, traders can only use settled funds for trading, which typically takes two [business](../b/business.md) days after a sell to settle. This naturally limits the frequency of trading and helps avoid PDT rules, but it also restricts the [trader](../t/trader.md)’s capability to [leverage](../l/leverage.md) and execute rapid trades.

## Advanced Considerations and Loopholes

### Trade Journals and Software

Maintaining a detailed [trade](../t/trade.md) [journal](../j/journal.md) and utilizing advanced [trade](../t/trade.md) tracking software can help traders methodically plan their trades and ensure they stay within the regulatory limits. Software can provide real-time data, alerts, and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) tools to prevent inadvertently crossing PDT thresholds.

### Offshore Accounts

Although risky and not recommended for most traders, some might consider opening brokerage accounts with firms outside of U.S. jurisdiction where PDT rules do not apply. However, such a strategy can present significant risks, including regulatory, legal, and operational risks.

### Order Splitting and Staggered Trade Execution

Another nuanced strategy involves [order](../o/order.md) splitting and staggered [trade](../t/trade.md) [execution](../e/execution.md), essentially breaking up trades into smaller orders, executed over days rather than within a single day, to avoid the [day trading](../d/day_trading.md) classification.

## Conclusion

[Pattern Day Trader](../p/pattern_day_trader.md) Rules are an essential component of the U.S. financial regulatory framework designed to control [risk](../r/risk.md) in the realm of [day trading](../d/day_trading.md). While these rules impose significant requirements and restrictions, they play a crucial role in maintaining [market](../m/market.md) integrity and protecting both traders and brokerages from undue [risk](../r/risk.md). Understanding and adhering to these rules is vital for anyone engaging in [day trading](../d/day_trading.md) activities in a [margin account](../m/margin_account.md).

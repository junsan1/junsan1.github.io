# Pivot Reversal Strategy

The Pivot [Reversal](../r/reversal.md) Strategy is a popular [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) tool used primarily in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) to identify potential reverse points in the price movements of financial instruments such as [stocks](../s/stock.md), currencies, commodities, and indices. This strategy relies on [pivot points](../p/pivot_points.md)â€”specific price levels that act as indicators of [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md). Traders and algo developers use these [pivot points](../p/pivot_points.md) as reference points to make trading decisions. In this comprehensive article, we [will](../w/will.md) delve into the technical intricacies of the Pivot [Reversal](../r/reversal.md) Strategy, explore its components, and understand how it is implemented in an [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) framework.

## 1. Fundamentals of Pivot Points

### Definition and Calculation

[Pivot points](../p/pivot_points.md) represent prices where the [market](../m/market.md) [trend](../t/trend.md) is expected to change direction. They are calculated based on the high, low, and closing prices of the previous trading period. The most common method is the standard [pivot point](../p/pivot_point.md) formula:

```
[Pivot Point](../p/pivot_point.md) (P) = (High + Low + Close) / 3
```

In addition to the main [pivot point](../p/pivot_point.md), other support (S) and resistance (R) levels are calculated as follows:

```
Resistance 1 (R1) = (2 * P) - Low
Support 1 (S1) = (2 * P) - High
Resistance 2 (R2) = P + (High - Low)
Support 2 (S2) = P - (High - Low)
Resistance 3 (R3) = High + 2(P - Low)
Support 3 (S3) = Low - 2(High - P)
```

These calculations are the foundation for the pivot [reversal](../r/reversal.md) strategy, indicating potential price [reversal](../r/reversal.md) points where traders can enter or exit positions.

### Types of Pivot Points

While the standard [pivot point](../p/pivot_point.md) is the most commonly used, there are several variations including:

- **Woodie's [Pivot Point](../p/pivot_point.md)**: Places more weight on the closing price.
- **Camarilla [Pivot Point](../p/pivot_point.md)**: Provides additional levels based on a fraction of the previous day's [range](../r/range.md).
- **Fibonacci [Pivot Point](../p/pivot_point.md)**: Incorporates [Fibonacci retracement](../f/fibonacci_retracement.md) levels into the pivot calculation.

Each type may appeal to different trading styles and may be chosen based on specific [market](../m/market.md) conditions or personal preferences.

## 2. The Pivot Reversal Strategy Mechanism

### Overview

The Pivot [Reversal](../r/reversal.md) Strategy is designed to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on anticipated price reversals at [pivot points](../p/pivot_points.md). The core concept revolves around buying low near [support levels](../s/support_levels.md) and selling high near resistance levels, essentially using [overbought](../o/overbought.md)/[oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions to determine [trade](../t/trade.md) entry and exit points. 

### Entry and Exit Signals

1. **Buying Opportunities**: A buy signal is generated when the price falls to a pivot support level (S1, S2, or S3) and shows signs of [reversal](../r/reversal.md), such as:
   - A bullish [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) pattern forming at the support level.
   - Increased buying [volume](../v/volume.md) at the support level.
   - Positive [divergence](../d/divergence.md) on an accompanying [indicator](../i/indicator.md) like RSI or MACD near the support level.

2. **Selling Opportunities**: A sell signal is generated when the price rises to a pivot resistance level (R1, R2, or R3) and shows signs of [reversal](../r/reversal.md), such as:
   - A bearish [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) pattern forming at the resistance level.
   - Increased selling [volume](../v/volume.md) at the resistance level.
   - Negative [divergence](../d/divergence.md) on an accompanying [indicator](../i/indicator.md) like RSI or MACD near the resistance level.

### Risk Management

Effective [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) is crucial for the success of the Pivot [Reversal](../r/reversal.md) Strategy. Some common techniques include:

- **[Stop-Loss Orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md)**: Placing [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md) below the support level for buy positions or above the resistance level for sell positions to limit potential losses.
- **[Position Sizing](../p/position_sizing.md)**: Calculating position size based [on account](../o/on_account.md) size, [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md), and distance to the stop-loss level.
- **Trailing Stops**: Implementing trailing stops to [lock in profits](../l/lock_in_profits.md) and protect against reversals after a [trade](../t/trade.md) has moved favorably.

## 3. Implementation in Algorithmic Trading

### Algorithm Structure

An algorithm based on the Pivot [Reversal](../r/reversal.md) Strategy typically includes:

- **Data Collection**: Aggregating historical price data (high, low, close) for calculating [pivot points](../p/pivot_points.md).
- **[Indicator](../i/indicator.md) Calculation**: Computing [pivot points](../p/pivot_points.md) and corresponding [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels.
- **Signal Generation**: Identifying buy and sell signals based on [price action](../p/price_action.md) at [pivot points](../p/pivot_points.md).
- **[Order](../o/order.md) [Execution](../e/execution.md)**: Automating the placement of buy and sell orders based on generated signals.
- **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Integrating stop-loss and take-[profit](../p/profit.md) rules to manage [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Example in Python

```python
[import](../i/import.md) pandas as pd

def calculate_pivots(df):
    df['Pivot'] = (df['High'] + df['Low'] + df['Close']) / 3
    df['R1'] = 2 * df['Pivot'] - df['Low']
    df['S1'] = 2 * df['Pivot'] - df['High']
    df['R2'] = df['Pivot'] + (df['High'] - df['Low'])
    df['S2'] = df['Pivot'] - (df['High'] - df['Low'])
    df['R3'] = df['High'] + 2 * (df['Pivot'] - df['Low'])
    df['S3'] = df['Low'] - 2 * (df['High'] - df['Pivot'])

def generate_signals(df):
    buy_signals = []
    sell_signals = []

    for i in [range](../r/range.md)(len(df)):
        if df['Low'][i] <= df['S1'][i]:
            buy_signals.append(df['Close'][i])
        else:
            buy_signals.append(None)

        if df['High'][i] >= df['R1'][i]:
            sell_signals.append(df['Close'][i])
        else:
            sell_signals.append(None)
    
    df['Buy_Signal'] = buy_signals
    df['Sell_Signal'] = sell_signals

df = pd.read_csv('historical_data.csv')
calculate_pivots(df)
generate_signals(df)
```

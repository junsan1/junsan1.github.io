# Pivot Reversal Strategy

The Pivot Reversal Strategy is a popular [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) tool used primarily in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) to identify potential reverse points in the price movements of financial instruments such as stocks, currencies, commodities, and indices. This strategy relies on [pivot points](../p/pivot_points.md)â€”specific price levels that act as indicators of [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md). Traders and algo developers use these [pivot points](../p/pivot_points.md) as reference points to make trading decisions. In this comprehensive article, we will delve into the technical intricacies of the Pivot Reversal Strategy, explore its components, and understand how it is implemented in an [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) framework.

## 1. Fundamentals of Pivot Points

### Definition and Calculation

[Pivot points](../p/pivot_points.md) represent prices where the market trend is expected to change direction. They are calculated based on the high, low, and closing prices of the previous trading period. The most common method is the standard pivot point formula:

```
Pivot Point (P) = (High + Low + Close) / 3
```

In addition to the main pivot point, other support (S) and resistance (R) levels are calculated as follows:

```
Resistance 1 (R1) = (2 * P) - Low
Support 1 (S1) = (2 * P) - High
Resistance 2 (R2) = P + (High - Low)
Support 2 (S2) = P - (High - Low)
Resistance 3 (R3) = High + 2(P - Low)
Support 3 (S3) = Low - 2(High - P)
```

These calculations are the foundation for the pivot reversal strategy, indicating potential price reversal points where traders can enter or exit positions.

### Types of Pivot Points

While the standard pivot point is the most commonly used, there are several variations including:

- **Woodie's Pivot Point**: Places more weight on the closing price.
- **Camarilla Pivot Point**: Provides additional levels based on a fraction of the previous day's range.
- **Fibonacci Pivot Point**: Incorporates Fibonacci retracement levels into the pivot calculation.

Each type may appeal to different trading styles and may be chosen based on specific market conditions or personal preferences.

## 2. The Pivot Reversal Strategy Mechanism

### Overview

The Pivot Reversal Strategy is designed to capitalize on anticipated price reversals at [pivot points](../p/pivot_points.md). The core concept revolves around buying low near [support levels](../s/support_levels.md) and selling high near resistance levels, essentially using overbought/oversold conditions to determine trade entry and exit points. 

### Entry and Exit Signals

1. **Buying Opportunities**: A buy signal is generated when the price falls to a pivot support level (S1, S2, or S3) and shows signs of reversal, such as:
   - A bullish candlestick pattern forming at the support level.
   - Increased buying volume at the support level.
   - Positive divergence on an accompanying indicator like RSI or MACD near the support level.

2. **Selling Opportunities**: A sell signal is generated when the price rises to a pivot resistance level (R1, R2, or R3) and shows signs of reversal, such as:
   - A bearish candlestick pattern forming at the resistance level.
   - Increased selling volume at the resistance level.
   - Negative divergence on an accompanying indicator like RSI or MACD near the resistance level.

### Risk Management

Effective [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) is crucial for the success of the Pivot Reversal Strategy. Some common techniques include:

- **[Stop-Loss Orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md)**: Placing [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md) below the support level for buy positions or above the resistance level for sell positions to limit potential losses.
- **[Position Sizing](../p/position_sizing.md)**: Calculating position size based on account size, risk tolerance, and distance to the stop-loss level.
- **Trailing Stops**: Implementing trailing stops to lock in profits and protect against reversals after a trade has moved favorably.

## 3. Implementation in Algorithmic Trading

### Algorithm Structure

An algorithm based on the Pivot Reversal Strategy typically includes:

- **Data Collection**: Aggregating historical price data (high, low, close) for calculating [pivot points](../p/pivot_points.md).
- **Indicator Calculation**: Computing [pivot points](../p/pivot_points.md) and corresponding [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels.
- **Signal Generation**: Identifying buy and sell signals based on price action at [pivot points](../p/pivot_points.md).
- **Order Execution**: Automating the placement of buy and sell orders based on generated signals.
- **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Integrating stop-loss and take-profit rules to manage risk.

### Example in Python

```python
import pandas as pd

def calculate_pivots(df):
    df['Pivot'] = (df['High'] + df['Low'] + df['Close']) / 3
    df['R1'] = 2 * df['Pivot'] - df['Low']
    df['S1'] = 2 * df['Pivot'] - df['High']
    df['R2'] = df['Pivot'] + (df['High'] - df['Low'])
    df['S2'] = df['Pivot'] - (df['High'] - df['Low'])
    df['R3'] = df['High'] + 2 * (df['Pivot'] - df['Low'])
    df['S3'] = df['Low'] - 2 * (df['High'] - df['Pivot'])

def generate_signals(df):
    buy_signals = []
    sell_signals = []

    for i in range(len(df)):
        if df['Low'][i] <= df['S1'][i]:
            buy_signals.append(df['Close'][i])
        else:
            buy_signals.append(None)

        if df['High'][i] >= df['R1'][i]:
            sell_signals.append(df['Close'][i])
        else:
            sell_signals.append(None)
    
    df['Buy_Signal'] = buy_signals
    df['Sell_Signal'] = sell_signals

df = pd.read_csv('historical_data.csv')
calculate_pivots(df)
generate_signals(df)
```

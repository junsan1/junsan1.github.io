# Preferred Stock Trading

Preferred stock trading is a specialized niche within the broader realm of stock trading that focuses on the buying and selling of preferred shares. Preferred stocks, or preference shares, are a class of equity that possess characteristics of both debt and equity. They typically offer fixed dividends and have a higher claim on assets and earnings than common stock, but they generally do not come with voting rights.

#### Overview of Preferred Stocks

Preferred stocks are often considered a hybrid between common stocks and bonds. They provide investors with fixed dividend payments, similar to bond interest payments, but their values can fluctuate with the overall stock market. Unlike bondholders, preferred shareholders may not be repaid their initial investment at maturity, but they do enjoy certain advantages that typically make preferred stocks less volatile than common stocks.

Key Characteristics:

- **Fixed Dividends**: Preferred stocks usually come with a fixed dividend, which is paid out before any dividends are distributed to common shareholders. This makes them an appealing option for income-focused investors.
- **Priority in Bankruptcy**: In the event of a company's liquidation, preferred shareholders have a higher claim on the company's assets than common shareholders, though they fall behind bondholders.
- **No Voting Rights**: Preferred shareholders often do not have voting rights, which means they do not have a say in company decisions.
- **Callable**: Many preferred stocks are callable, meaning the issuing company can redeem them at a predetermined price after a specified date.

#### Types of Preferred Stocks

Preferred stocks come in various forms, each with unique characteristics and potential benefits:

1. **Cumulative Preferred Stock**: These shares accumulate unpaid dividends. If a company suspends dividend payments, it must pay all missed dividends to cumulative preferred shareholders before paying any dividends to common shareholders.
2. **Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock**: These shares do not accumulate unpaid dividends. If a company skips a dividend payment, shareholders of non-cumulative preferred stocks have no right to claim the unpaid dividends.
3. **Convertible Preferred Stock**: These can be converted into a predetermined number of common shares, offering potential for capital appreciation.
4. **Perpetual Preferred Stock**: These stocks do not have a maturity date, meaning they pay dividends indefinitely.
5. **Adjustable-Rate Preferred Stock**: The dividends on these stocks are adjusted periodically based on benchmark interest rates.

#### Advantages of Preferred Stock

Preferred stocks can be an attractive investment choice for several reasons:

- **Income Generation**: The fixed dividend payments provide a steady income stream, making them suitable for conservative investors.
- **Stability**: Preferred stocks are generally less volatile than common stocks, offering a safer investment during market turbulence.
- **Tax Benefits**: In some jurisdictions, dividends from preferred stocks may be taxed at a lower rate than interest from bonds.
- **Priority Over Common Stock**: In case of a company's bankruptcy, preferred shareholders are compensated before common shareholders.

#### Risks of Preferred Stock

Despite their benefits, preferred stocks carry certain risks:

- **Interest Rate Risk**: As with bonds, the value of preferred stocks can decline when interest rates rise.
- **Credit Risk**: If the issuing company encounters financial difficulties, it may suspend dividend payments.
- **Limited Capital Appreciation**: Preferred stocks generally offer less potential for price appreciation compared to common stocks.
- **[Liquidity Risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md)**: Preferred stocks may be less liquid than common stocks, making it harder to buy or sell them quickly.

#### Preferred Stock Trading Strategies

Preferred stock trading involves various strategies aimed at optimizing returns while managing risk:

1. **Buy and Hold**: This strategy focuses on purchasing preferred stocks and holding them for a long period to benefit from dividend payments and potential price appreciation.
2. **Dividend Capture**: Investors buy preferred stocks just before the ex-dividend date to capture the dividend, then sell the stocks shortly after the ex-dividend date.
3. **Pair Trading**: This involves taking long and short positions in related securities to hedge against market risk. For instance, an investor might go long on a preferred stock and short on the corresponding common stock.
4. **Interest Rate Hedging**: Given their sensitivity to interest rates, some traders employ strategies that hedge against interest rate movements, such as using options or investing in instruments that benefit from rising rates.

# Preferred Stock Trading

[Preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md) trading is a specialized niche within the broader realm of stock trading that focuses on the buying and selling of preferred [shares](../s/shares.md). Preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md), or [preference shares](../p/preference_shares.md), are a class of [equity](../e/equity.md) that possess characteristics of both [debt](../d/debt.md) and [equity](../e/equity.md). They typically [offer](../o/offer.md) fixed dividends and have a higher claim on assets and [earnings](../e/earnings.md) than [common stock](../c/common_stock.md), but they generally do not come with voting rights.

#### Overview of Preferred Stocks

Preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) are often considered a hybrid between common [stocks](../s/stock.md) and bonds. They provide investors with fixed [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payments, similar to [bond](../b/bond.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) payments, but their values can fluctuate with the overall [stock market](../s/stock_market.md). Unlike bondholders, preferred shareholders may not be repaid their initial investment at [maturity](../m/maturity.md), but they do enjoy certain advantages that typically make preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) less volatile than common [stocks](../s/stock.md).

Key Characteristics:

- **Fixed Dividends**: Preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) usually come with a fixed [dividend](../d/dividend.md), which is paid out before any dividends are distributed to common shareholders. This makes them an appealing option for [income](../i/income.md)-focused investors.
- **Priority in [Bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md)**: In the event of a company's [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md), preferred shareholders have a higher claim on the company's assets than common shareholders, though they fall behind bondholders.
- **No Voting Rights**: Preferred shareholders often do not have voting rights, which means they do not have a say in company decisions.
- **Callable**: Many preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) are callable, meaning the issuing company can redeem them at a predetermined price after a specified date.

#### Types of Preferred Stocks

Preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) come in various forms, each with unique characteristics and potential benefits:

1. **Cumulative [Preferred Stock](../p/preferred_stock.md)**: These [shares](../s/shares.md) accumulate unpaid dividends. If a company suspends [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payments, it must pay all missed dividends to cumulative preferred shareholders before paying any dividends to common shareholders.
2. **Non-Cumulative [Preferred Stock](../p/preferred_stock.md)**: These [shares](../s/shares.md) do not accumulate unpaid dividends. If a company skips a [dividend](../d/dividend.md) [payment](../p/payment.md), shareholders of non-cumulative preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) have no right to claim the unpaid dividends.
3. **[Convertible Preferred Stock](../c/convertible_preferred_stock.md)**: These can be converted into a predetermined number of common [shares](../s/shares.md), [offering](../o/offering.md) potential for [capital](../c/capital.md) appreciation.
4. **Perpetual [Preferred Stock](../p/preferred_stock.md)**: These [stocks](../s/stock.md) do not have a [maturity date](../m/maturity_date.md), meaning they pay dividends indefinitely.
5. **Adjustable-Rate [Preferred Stock](../p/preferred_stock.md)**: The dividends on these [stocks](../s/stock.md) are adjusted periodically based on [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

#### Advantages of Preferred Stock

Preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) can be an attractive investment choice for several reasons:

- **[Income](../i/income.md) Generation**: The fixed [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payments provide a steady [income](../i/income.md) stream, making them suitable for conservative investors.
- **Stability**: Preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) are generally less volatile than common [stocks](../s/stock.md), [offering](../o/offering.md) a safer investment during [market](../m/market.md) turbulence.
- **Tax Benefits**: In some jurisdictions, dividends from preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) may be taxed at a lower rate than [interest](../i/interest.md) from bonds.
- **Priority Over [Common Stock](../c/common_stock.md)**: In case of a company's [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md), preferred shareholders are compensated before common shareholders.

#### Risks of Preferred Stock

Despite their benefits, preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) carry certain risks:

- **[Interest Rate Risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md)**: As with bonds, the [value](../v/value.md) of preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) can decline when [interest](../i/interest.md) rates rise.
- **[Credit Risk](../c/credit_risk.md)**: If the issuing company encounters financial difficulties, it may suspend [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payments.
- **Limited [Capital](../c/capital.md) Appreciation**: Preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) generally [offer](../o/offer.md) less potential for price appreciation compared to common [stocks](../s/stock.md).
- **[Liquidity Risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md)**: Preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) may be less [liquid](../l/liquid.md) than common [stocks](../s/stock.md), making it harder to buy or sell them quickly.

#### Preferred Stock Trading Strategies

[Preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md) trading involves various strategies aimed at optimizing returns while managing [risk](../r/risk.md):

1. **[Buy and Hold](../b/buy_and_hold.md)**: This strategy focuses on purchasing preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) and holding them for a long period to benefit from [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payments and potential price appreciation.
2. **[Dividend](../d/dividend.md) Capture**: Investors buy preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) just before the [ex-dividend](../e/ex-dividend.md) date to capture the [dividend](../d/dividend.md), then sell the [stocks](../s/stock.md) shortly after the [ex-dividend](../e/ex-dividend.md) date.
3. **Pair Trading**: This involves taking long and short positions in related securities to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against [market risk](../m/market_risk.md). For instance, an [investor](../i/investor.md) might go long on a [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md) and short on the corresponding [common stock](../c/common_stock.md).
4. **[Interest Rate](../i/interest_rate.md) Hedging**: Given their sensitivity to [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, some traders employ strategies that [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) movements, such as using [options](../o/options.md) or [investing](../i/investing.md) in instruments that benefit from rising rates.

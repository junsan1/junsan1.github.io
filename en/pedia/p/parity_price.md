# Parity Price

[Parity](../p/parity.md) price is a financial term that describes a situation where two assets have equivalent [value](../v/value.md). This concept is primarily used in the context of trading and [finance](../f/finance.md), and it is particularly pertinent for analyzing different yet interconnected financial instruments such as [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, [futures](../f/futures.md), and [options](../o/options.md). The concept of [parity](../p/parity.md) price ensures that investors are aware of relative pricing and helps in identifying profitable [arbitrage opportunities](../a/arbitrage_opportunities.md). Here is a comprehensive guide detailing the various aspects of [parity](../p/parity.md) price.

## What is Parity Price?

[Parity](../p/parity.md) price refers to the [price level](../p/price_level.md) at which two [marketable securities](../m/marketable_securities.md), such as a [convertible bond](../c/convertible_bond.md) and the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock, have equal [value](../v/value.md). This means that the [convertible bond](../c/convertible_bond.md) can be exchanged for the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock without any financial [gain](../g/gain.md) or loss. Essentially, the [parity](../p/parity.md) price serves as a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for evaluating whether a particular [security](../s/security.md) is [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md) or [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) relative to another.

## Key Examples of Parity Price

### Convertible Bonds

One of the most common uses of [parity](../p/parity.md) price is in the pricing of convertible bonds. A [convertible bond](../c/convertible_bond.md) can be exchanged for a predetermined number of [shares](../s/shares.md) of the issuing company's stock. The [parity](../p/parity.md) price in this context would be the price at which the [value](../v/value.md) of the [bond](../b/bond.md) equals the [value](../v/value.md) of the [shares](../s/shares.md) that the [bond](../b/bond.md) can be converted into.

Formula:
\[ \text{Parity Price} = \frac{\text{[Market Price](../m/market_price.md) of the [Bond](../b/bond.md)}}{\text{Conversion Ratio}} \]

For example, if a [convertible bond](../c/convertible_bond.md) is selling for $1,000 and can be converted into 50 [shares](../s/shares.md) of stock, then the [parity](../p/parity.md) price of the stock would be:
\[ \text{[Parity](../p/parity.md) Price} = \frac{1000}{50} = \$20 \]

If the current [market price](../m/market_price.md) of the stock is different from the [parity](../p/parity.md) price, it might present a trading opportunity.

### Futures Contracts

[Parity](../p/parity.md) price also applies to [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md). The concept is used to determine the [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) of a [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) relative to its [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). Specifically, it helps in identifying [arbitrage opportunities](../a/arbitrage_opportunities.md) between the [spot price](../s/spot_price.md) (current [market price](../m/market_price.md)) and the [futures](../f/futures.md) price.

Formula:
\[ \text{Futures Parity Price} = \text{Spot Price} + (\text{Spot Price} \times \text{Risk-Free Interest Rate} - \text{[Dividend Yield](../d/dividend_yield.md)}) \times \text{Time to [Maturity](../m/maturity.md)} \]

If the current [futures](../f/futures.md) price differs from the calculated [parity](../p/parity.md) price, it may indicate an [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) opportunity, enabling traders to [profit](../p/profit.md) from pricing inefficiencies.

### Options

In the context of [options](../o/options.md), [parity](../p/parity.md) price can be used to identify [exercise](../e/exercise.md) and [arbitrage opportunities](../a/arbitrage_opportunities.md). For callable bonds, the [parity](../p/parity.md) price helps in determining the call price of the [bond](../b/bond.md) which equates the [value](../v/value.md) of the [bond](../b/bond.md) and the option.

## Factors Influencing Parity Price

Several factors can influence [parity](../p/parity.md) price, including:

1. **[Interest](../i/interest.md) Rates**: Changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates can affect the [value](../v/value.md) of convertible bonds and [options](../o/options.md), thereby impacting their [parity](../p/parity.md) price.
2. **Dividends**: [Dividend](../d/dividend.md) payouts can alter the [value](../v/value.md) of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock and subsequently affect the [parity](../p/parity.md) price.
3. **[Market](../m/market.md) Conditions**: [Volatility](../v/volatility.md) and overall [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) can also influence [parity](../p/parity.md) prices of various financial securities.
4. **Conversion Ratios**: The specific terms of a [convertible bond](../c/convertible_bond.md), such as its conversion ratio, are crucial in determining [parity](../p/parity.md) price.
5. **Time to [Maturity](../m/maturity.md)**: The remaining time until a [bond](../b/bond.md) or [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) matures also influences its [parity](../p/parity.md) price.

## Parity Price and Arbitrage

The concept of [parity](../p/parity.md) price is fundamental for [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategies. [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) involves buying and selling equivalent securities in different markets to [profit](../p/profit.md) from price discrepancies. If the [market price](../m/market_price.md) deviates from the [parity](../p/parity.md) price, arbitrageurs can execute trades that bring the prices back in line, thus making a [risk](../r/risk.md)-free [profit](../p/profit.md).

For example, if the [market price](../m/market_price.md) of a stock is higher than the [parity](../p/parity.md) price suggested by a [convertible bond](../c/convertible_bond.md), an [arbitrageur](../a/arbitrageur.md) could short the stock and buy the [convertible bond](../c/convertible_bond.md), locking in a [profit](../p/profit.md) when the prices converge.

## Real-life Applications

### Commodities Market

[Parity](../p/parity.md) price can be crucial in the commodities [market](../m/market.md), particularly for [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md). For example, in agricultural products like wheat, the [parity](../p/parity.md) price can help in understanding the [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) against current [market](../m/market.md) prices, enabling hedgers and speculators to make informed decisions.

### Fixed Income Securities

[Investment banks](../i/investment_bank_(ib).md) and institutional investors often use [parity](../p/parity.md) price in the analysis of [fixed income securities](../f/fixed_income_securities.md), such as convertible bonds. This helps in determining whether to [hold](../h/hold.md) the [bond](../b/bond.md), convert it, or sell it in the [open market](../o/open_market.md), optimizing returns.

### Equity Markets

In [equity](../e/equity.md) markets, [parity](../p/parity.md) price helps in the assessment of stock [options](../o/options.md) and [warrants](../w/warrants_in_trading.md). It essentially assists in making decisions related to buying or selling [stocks](../s/stock.md) versus exercising [options](../o/options.md).

## Case Studies

### Example 1: Tesla Convertible Bonds

Tesla issued a series of convertible bonds in 2017, which could be converted into [equity](../e/equity.md). Throughout the period, the [parity](../p/parity.md) price helped investors in evaluating whether to [hold](../h/hold.md) the bonds or convert them into Tesla's [stocks](../s/stock.md), especially given the fluctuations in Tesla's stock price.

### Example 2: Agricultural Futures

In the agricultural sector, [parity](../p/parity.md) price calculations for corn and wheat [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) have enabled traders to identify [arbitrage opportunities](../a/arbitrage_opportunities.md) between different exchanges or contract maturities.

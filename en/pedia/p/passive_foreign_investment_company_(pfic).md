# Passive Foreign Investment Company (PFIC)

A Passive [Foreign Investment](../f/foreign_investment.md) Company (PFIC) is a foreign [corporation](../c/corporation.md) with certain passive characteristics, which subjects its U.S. shareholders to specific tax rules. The PFIC regime was introduced by the U.S. Congress in the [Tax Reform Act of 1986](../t/tax_reform_act_of_1986.md) to curb tax deferral and avoidance by U.S. taxpayers who invested through foreign corporations that generate primarily [passive income](../p/passive_income.md). The rules around PFICs are complex and require rigorous compliance to avoid severe tax consequences.

## Definition of a PFIC

According to U.S. tax law, a foreign [corporation](../c/corporation.md) is classified as a PFIC if it meets either of the following tests during its taxable year:

1. **[Income](../i/income.md) Test**: 75% or more of the [corporation](../c/corporation.md)’s [gross income](../g/gross_income.md) for the taxable year is [passive income](../p/passive_income.md), such as dividends, [interest](../i/interest.md), rents, royalties, annuities, and [capital](../c/capital.md) gains.
2. **[Asset](../a/asset.md) Test**: 50% or more of the average [value](../v/value.md) of the [corporation](../c/corporation.md)’s assets produce, or are held for the production of, [passive income](../p/passive_income.md).

[Income](../i/income.md) that can be excluded from [passive income](../p/passive_income.md), for purposes of determining PFIC status, includes active [business](../b/business.md) [income](../i/income.md) or rents and royalties derived in the active conduct of a [trade](../t/trade.md) or [business](../b/business.md). However, this exclusion has specific definitions and conditions that must be met.

## U.S. Taxation of Shareholders of PFICs

U.S. taxpayers holding [shares](../s/shares.md) in a PFIC are subjected to disadvantageous tax treatments known as the "excess [distribution](../d/distribution.md) regime." This regime imposes tax and [interest](../i/interest.md) charges on excessive distributions from and gains on the [sale](../s/sale.md) of PFIC stock. The primary methods of [taxation](../t/taxation.md) include:

1. **Excess [Distribution](../d/distribution.md)**: Distributions from a PFIC that exceed 125% of the average distributions received in the previous three years are deemed “excess distributions.” The excess [distribution](../d/distribution.md) is subject to tax at the highest marginal rate and an [interest](../i/interest.md) charge is applied to account for the deferral of [taxes](../t/taxes.md).
2. **[Disposition](../d/disposition.md) of PFIC [Shares](../s/shares.md)**: [Gain](../g/gain.md) from the [sale](../s/sale.md) of PFIC [shares](../s/shares.md) is treated in a similar way to excess distributions, with an [interest](../i/interest.md) charge applied to the gains. 

## Qualified Electing Fund (QEF) Election

One method for U.S. shareholders to avoid the complex excess [distribution](../d/distribution.md) rules is to make a Qualified Electing [Fund](../f/fund.md) (QEF) election. This election allows the [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) to include in their [income](../i/income.md) their pro-rata share of the PFIC’s [earnings](../e/earnings.md) and profits each year, even if no actual distributions are made. This mitigates the harsh “excess [distribution](../d/distribution.md)” rules but requires the PFIC to provide the shareholders with annual information to compute their share of [income](../i/income.md) and gains.

### Requirements for QEF Election

- **Annual Reporting**: The PFIC must provide annual information statements to U.S. shareholders detailing the ordinary [earnings](../e/earnings.md) and net [capital](../c/capital.md) gains of the PFIC.
- **Consent of the PFIC**: The foreign [corporation](../c/corporation.md) must agree to comply with U.S. tax reporting requirements.

The main advantage of a QEF election is that the [income](../i/income.md) is treated as [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md) and long-term [capital gain](../c/capital_gain.md), subject to favorable tax rates without being subjected to the [interest](../i/interest.md) charge associated with excessive distributions.

## Mark to Market Election

Another election available to shareholders of a PFIC is the mark-to-[market](../m/market.md) (MTM) election. Under this approach, the [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) treats the PFIC stock as if it’s sold at its fair [market value](../m/market_value.md) on the last day of the taxable year. The resulting gains are included in [income](../i/income.md), while losses are allowed only to the extent of previously included gains.

### MTM Election Key Points

- **Annual Inclusion**: Shareholders recognize annually the [unrealized gains](../u/unrealized_gains.md) and losses on their PFIC [shares](../s/shares.md).
- **[Ordinary Income](../o/ordinary_income.md)**: Gains are treated as [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md), and losses are treated as ordinary losses only up to previous inclusions of [income](../i/income.md).
- **Publicly Traded PFICs**: This election is generally available only for PFICs with stock traded on established securities markets.

## Reporting Requirements for PFIC Shareholders

U.S. shareholders of PFICs must file IRS Form 8621, “Information [Return](../r/return.md) by a [Shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) of a Passive [Foreign Investment](../f/foreign_investment.md) Company or Qualified Electing [Fund](../f/fund.md),” to report their PFIC investments and any associated elections (QEF or MTM). Failure to file Form 8621 can result in significant penalties and the indefinite suspension of the [statute of limitations](../s/statute_of_limitations.md) on the PFIC-related tax year.

### Important Information to Report

- **Distributions**: Details of any distributions from the PFIC.
- **Elections**: Designation of any QEF or MTM elections made by the shareholders.
- **[Gain](../g/gain.md) Realization**: Any gains realized upon the [sale](../s/sale.md) of PFIC stock.

## Complexity and Compliance

Managing the tax [obligations](../o/obligation.md) of PFIC investments is notably complex, necessitating careful planning and compliance. Many U.S. shareholders of foreign mutual funds, for instance, may inadvertently acquire [shares](../s/shares.md) in PFICs and face unexpected tax consequences. It's typically advisable for investors to seek expert tax advice when dealing with PFICs to navigate the intricate rules and to make informed decisions about elections and compliance.

## Conclusion

PFIC rules are designed to prevent U.S. taxpayers from deferring [taxes](../t/taxes.md) on [passive income](../p/passive_income.md) earned through foreign corporations. The intricate details around the [income](../i/income.md) tests, [asset](../a/asset.md) tests, and the methods available to U.S. shareholders (such as QEF or MTM elections) require meticulous attention to compliance. For those [investing](../i/investing.md) internationally, particularly through foreign mutual funds or other passive investment tools, understanding and managing PFIC rules is essential to avoid unfavorable tax treatment and compliance issues.

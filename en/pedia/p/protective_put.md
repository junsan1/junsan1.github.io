# Protective Put

A protective put is an [options](../o/options.md) [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) designed to mitigate [risk](../r/risk.md) by purchasing a [put option](../p/put.md) for an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) that an [investor](../i/investor.md) already holds. This strategy protects against potential declines in the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), while still allowing for [upside potential](../u/upside_potential_in_trading.md). The protective put is often viewed as an [insurance](../i/insurance.md) policy for an investment portfolio.

## Key Components

### Underlying Asset

The [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) is the [security](../s/security.md) or [asset](../a/asset.md) that the [put option](../p/put.md) is purchased against. An [investor](../i/investor.md) typically holds the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) in their portfolio and seeks to protect against [downside risk](../d/downside_risk.md).

### Put Option

A [put option](../p/put.md) is a financial contract that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at a specified [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) within a specified time frame. The buyer of the [put option](../p/put.md) pays a [premium](../p/premium.md) to the seller for this right.

### Strike Price

The [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) is the pre-determined price at which the holder of the [put option](../p/put.md) can sell the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). The protective put strategy sets the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) at a level that provides a reasonable amount of protection against a drop in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price.

### Expiration Date

The [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md) is the date on which the [put option](../p/put.md) contract expires. The protective put is only effective until this date. After that, a new option contract would need to be purchased to continue the protection.

### Premium

The [premium](../p/premium.md) is the price paid by the [investor](../i/investor.md) to purchase the [put option](../p/put.md). This cost is non-refundable and represents the [insurance premium](../i/insurance_premium.md) paid to protect the investment.

## How It Works

When an [investor](../i/investor.md) implements a protective put strategy, they are simultaneously long the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) and long the [put option](../p/put.md). The [put option](../p/put.md) acts as a [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against a decline in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price. If the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) falls below the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md), the [put option](../p/put.md) gains [value](../v/value.md), offsetting the loss in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

For example, an [investor](../i/investor.md) holds 100 [shares](../s/shares.md) of a stock currently trading at $100 per share. They purchase a [put option](../p/put.md) with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $95, expiring in three months, for a [premium](../p/premium.md) of $2 per share. If the stock price falls to $80, the [investor](../i/investor.md) can [exercise](../e/exercise.md) the [put option](../p/put.md) and sell the [shares](../s/shares.md) at $95, limiting their loss to $7 per share (the $5 difference between the current stock price and the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md), plus the $2 [premium](../p/premium.md) paid).

## Benefits

1. **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Mitigation**: The primary benefit of a protective put is that it provides downside protection, limiting potential losses in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

2. **Unlimited [Upside Potential](../u/upside_potential_in_trading.md)**: Unlike some other [hedging strategies](../h/hedging_strategies.md), a protective put allows the [investor](../i/investor.md) to benefit from any potential [upside](../u/upside.md) in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price. If the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s price increases, the [investor](../i/investor.md) can simply let the [put option](../p/put.md) expire worthless and continue to benefit from the price appreciation.

3. **Flexibility**: Protective puts can be tailored to different levels of [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) by selecting different strike prices and expiration dates. This allows investors to customize their protection based on their investment goals and [market](../m/market.md) outlook.

## Drawbacks

1. **Cost**: The primary drawback of a protective put strategy is the cost of the [premium](../p/premium.md). Paying for [put options](../p/put_options.md) over time can add up, reducing overall portfolio returns.

2. **[Time Decay](../t/time_decay.md)**: [Put options](../p/put_options.md) are subject to [time decay](../t/time_decay.md), meaning they lose [value](../v/value.md) as they approach their [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md). If the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price does not decline significantly, the [put option](../p/put.md) may expire worthless, and the [premium](../p/premium.md) paid [will](../w/will.md) be a [sunk cost](../s/sunk_cost.md).

3. **Complexity**: Using protective puts requires a good understanding of [options](../o/options.md) trading. Investors need to be familiar with option pricing, strike prices, expiration dates, and the overall mechanics of option contracts.

## When to Use a Protective Put

### Market Uncertainty

Investors may use a protective put during times of [market](../m/market.md) [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) or [volatility](../v/volatility.md). This strategy provides peace of mind by limiting potential losses while still allowing for gains if the [market](../m/market.md) recovers.

### Earnings Announcements

Companies often experience significant stock price movements around [earnings announcements](../e/earnings_announcements.md). Investors who are long a stock but are concerned about potential negative surprises may purchase protective puts to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against [downside risk](../d/downside_risk.md).

### Long-Term Investments

Investors with [long-term investments](../l/long-term_investments.md) may use protective puts to protect against short-term [market](../m/market.md) fluctuations. This strategy allows them to stay invested in their positions without being overly concerned about short-term [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

## Example Scenarios

1. **Scenario 1: [Market](../m/market.md) Decline**
    - Stock Price: $100
    - [Strike Price](../s/strike_price.md): $95
    - [Premium](../p/premium.md): $2
    - Stock Falls to: $80
    - Loss Without Put: $20 per share
    - Loss With Put: $7 per share (95 - 80 + 2)

2. **Scenario 2: [Market](../m/market.md) [Rally](../r/rally.md)**
    - Stock Price: $100
    - [Strike Price](../s/strike_price.md): $95
    - [Premium](../p/premium.md): $2
    - Stock Rises to: $120
    - [Gain](../g/gain.md) Without Put: $20 per share
    - [Gain](../g/gain.md) With Put: $18 per share (20 [gain](../g/gain.md) - 2 [premium](../p/premium.md))

## Conclusion

The protective put is a valuable tool for investors looking to safeguard their portfolios against potential losses while retaining [upside potential](../u/upside_potential_in_trading.md). While the strategy involves costs and requires a solid understanding of [options](../o/options.md) trading, the benefits of reduced [risk](../r/risk.md) and flexibility make it an attractive option for managing investment [risk](../r/risk.md). By selecting appropriate strike prices and expiration dates, investors can tailor the protective put strategy to their specific needs and [market](../m/market.md) outlook, providing a customized approach to portfolio protection.

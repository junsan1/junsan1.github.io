# Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE)

The Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) is the primary stock exchange in the Philippines, functioning as a critical financial institution in the Southeast Asian region. Established on December 23, 1992, through the consolidation of the Manila Stock Exchange (MSE) and the Makati Stock Exchange (MkSE), the PSE serves as a pivotal platform for capital raising, liquidity, and market efficiency within the Philippine financial system. It is headquartered in Bonifacio Global City, Taguig, Metro Manila. The PSE is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the Philippines.

## Historical Context

### Formation
The roots of the PSE can be traced back to the Manila Stock Exchange, which was established on August 8, 1927. The Makati Stock Exchange was established later on May 27, 1963. Both exchanges operated independently for many years, leading to inefficiencies and operational redundancies. To streamline operations and foster a more robust capital market, these two entities were merged to create the Philippine Stock Exchange in 1992.

### Evolution
In the years following its establishment, the PSE has undergone significant developments, including the introduction of automated trading in 1993, the launch of the PSE Composite Index (PSEi), and its subsequent modernization efforts. Notably, the PSE made its own public offering in December 2003, further aligning its operations with international standards and best practices.

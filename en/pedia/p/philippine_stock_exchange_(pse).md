# Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE)

The Philippine Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (PSE) is the primary stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md) in the Philippines, functioning as a critical financial institution in the Southeast Asian region. Established on December 23, 1992, through the [consolidation](../c/consolidation.md) of the Manila Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (MSE) and the Makati Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (MkSE), the PSE serves as a pivotal platform for [capital](../c/capital.md) raising, [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), and [market efficiency](../m/market_efficiency.md) within the Philippine [financial system](../f/financial_system.md). It is headquartered in Bonifacio Global City, Taguig, Metro Manila. The PSE is regulated by the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) of the Philippines.

## Historical Context

### Formation
The roots of the PSE can be traced back to the Manila Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md), which was established on August 8, 1927. The Makati Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) was established later on May 27, 1963. Both exchanges operated independently for many years, leading to inefficiencies and operational redundancies. To streamline operations and foster a more [robust](../r/robust.md) [capital](../c/capital.md) [market](../m/market.md), these two entities were merged to create the Philippine Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) in 1992.

### Evolution
In the years following its establishment, the PSE has undergone significant developments, including the introduction of automated trading in 1993, the launch of the PSE Composite [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (PSEi), and its subsequent modernization efforts. Notably, the PSE made its own public [offering](../o/offering.md) in December 2003, further aligning its operations with international standards and [best practices](../b/best_practices.md).

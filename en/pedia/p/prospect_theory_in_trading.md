# Prospect Theory

## Introduction to Prospect Theory

Prospect Theory is a behavioral economic theory that was developed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in 1979. Unlike classical [utility theory](../u/utility_theory_in_trading.md), which assumes that individuals make rational decisions to maximize [expected utility](../e/expected_utility.md), Prospect Theory describes how people actually make decisions under [risk](../r/risk.md) and [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md). It highlights the fact that real-life decision making often deviates from the rational model, being influenced by biases and [heuristics](../h/heuristics.md).

In the context of trading, Prospect Theory can provide insights into the behavior of traders and investors, highlighting why they often make irrational decisions like holding onto losing positions or selling winning positions too early.

## Key Components of Prospect Theory

Prospect Theory is composed of several key components that distinguish it from traditional economic theories:

### 1. Value Function

The [value](../v/value.md) function in Prospect Theory is defined on deviations from a reference point (often the status quo), and it is generally concave for gains and convex for losses. It is also steeper for losses than for gains, which implies that losses loom larger than gainsâ€”a phenomenon known as [loss aversion](../l/loss_aversion.md).

#### Illustration:
- If a [trader](../t/trader.md) gains $100, the positive [utility](../u/utility.md) they derive from this [gain](../g/gain.md) [will](../w/will.md) be less than the negative [utility](../u/utility.md) they experience from losing $100.
- Therefore, traders are more likely to take risks to avoid losses rather than to secure gains.

### 2. Probability Weighting

Prospect Theory also incorporates a probability weighting function, which captures the fact that people tend to overweigh small probabilities and underweigh large probabilities. This means that traders often overestimate the likelihood of rare events and underestimate the likelihood of common events.

#### Illustration:
- A [trader](../t/trader.md) might irrationally believe that a small, volatile stock [will](../w/will.md) skyrocket because they overestimate the probability of a huge [gain](../g/gain.md).
- Conversely, they might downplay the stable, albeit modest, returns of a safer investment.

## Implications for Trading Behavior

### 1. Loss Aversion and Holding Losing Positions

[Loss aversion](../l/loss_aversion.md) can cause traders to [hold](../h/hold.md) on to losing positions longer than they should. The emotional pain associated with realizing a loss can lead traders to delay the [sale](../s/sale.md) of an underperforming [asset](../a/asset.md) in the hope that it [will](../w/will.md) rebound, even when the rational decision would be to cut their losses.

#### Example:
- A [trader](../t/trader.md) buys a stock at $50, which then drops to $40. Despite signals that the stock might keep falling, the [trader](../t/trader.md) holds onto it, hoping to sell it when it rebounds to at least $50.

### 2. Disposition Effect

The [disposition](../d/disposition.md) effect is the tendency for investors to sell assets that have increased in [value](../v/value.md) while holding assets that have decreased in [value](../v/value.md). This behavior contradicts the rational strategy of cutting losses and letting profits run.

#### Example:
- A [trader](../t/trader.md) who owns two [stocks](../s/stock.md): one that has gained in [value](../v/value.md) and one that has lost. They sell the profitable one to "lock in" gains and [hold](../h/hold.md) onto the losing one to avoid realizing a loss.

### 3. Overtrading

The over-weighting of small probabilities can lead traders to engage in excessive trading, trying to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on unlikely but potentially high-reward opportunities. This can result in [overtrading](../o/overtrading.md), which is often costly in terms of [transaction fees](../t/transaction_fees.md) and suboptimal decision-making.

### 4. Overconfidence

While not a direct component of Prospect Theory, overconfidence is a common behavioral bias among traders that is related to the theory. Traders who overestimate their ability to predict [market](../m/market.md) movements might engage in riskier trades and suffer greater losses, especially when compounded by the biases described above.

## Strategies to Mitigate Irrational Behavior

Understanding the implications of Prospect Theory on trading behavior can help traders develop strategies to mitigate irrational decision-making. Here are some strategies:

### 1. Setting Predefined Rules

Traders can establish predefined rules for entry and exit points, as well as [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md), to minimize the emotional influence on trading decisions. This can help avoid the biases introduced by [loss aversion](../l/loss_aversion.md) and the [disposition](../d/disposition.md) effect.

### 2. Diversification

Diversifying a portfolio can reduce the impact of potential losses from any single investment, mitigating the tendency to over-focus on individual losses or gains.

### 3. Education and Training

Ongoing education about [behavioral biases](../b/behavioral_biases_in_trading.md) and how they influence trading can help traders recognize and counteract these tendencies in their decision-making.

### 4. Using Automated Trading Systems

[Automated trading systems](../a/automated_trading_systems.md) can implement strategies without the emotional biases that typically affect human traders. Algorithms can follow predefined rules objectively, reducing the impact of the biases associated with [loss aversion](../l/loss_aversion.md) and over-weighing probabilities.

## Conclusion

Prospect Theory offers a valuable framework for understanding the irrational behaviors that can influence trading decisions. By recognizing the key components of Prospect Theory, such as [loss aversion](../l/loss_aversion.md) and probability weighting, traders can implement strategies to mitigate these biases and make more rational financial decisions. Awareness and education are critical in fostering a more disciplined and objective approach to trading.

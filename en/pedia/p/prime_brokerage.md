# Prime Brokerage

In the world of [finance](../f/finance.md) and trading, **prime brokerage** services are critical for [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds, large institutional investors, and sophisticated financial entities. These services provide a [range](../r/range.md) of integrated financial solutions that allow these investors to efficiently [trade](../t/trade.md) and manage their portfolios. Here we'll explore what prime brokerage is, its key components, the benefits it provides to its clients, the potential risks associated with it, and notable [industry](../i/industry.md) players.

## What is Prime Brokerage?

Prime brokerage refers to a bundle of services offered by [investment banks](../i/investment_bank_(ib).md) and other financial institutions to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds and other large institutional clients. The aim is to provide these entities with back-end support and various auxiliary services to facilitate large-scale trading activities.

## Key Components of Prime Brokerage

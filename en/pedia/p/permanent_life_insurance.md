# Permanent Life Insurance

Permanent [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) is a type of [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policy that provides lifelong coverage. Unlike [term life insurance](../t/term_life_insurance.md) which only lasts for a specific number of years, permanent [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) is designed to last your entire life, so long as premiums are paid. This type of [insurance](../i/insurance.md) can serve as an enduring financial tool that combines both a [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) and a savings component, giving policyholders [robust](../r/robust.md) financial protection and the potential for [wealth](../w/wealth.md) accumulation. 

## Types of Permanent Life Insurance

There are several types of permanent [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md), each with its own unique features and benefits:

### Whole Life Insurance

[Whole life insurance](../w/whole_life_insurance.md) is the most straightforward form of permanent [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md). It offers a fixed [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md), fixed premiums, and a cash [value](../v/value.md) component that grows at a guaranteed rate. Whole life policies often provide [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payments, which the policyholder can use in various ways, including purchasing additional coverage or offsetting premiums.

### Universal Life Insurance

[Universal life insurance](../u/universal_life_insurance.md) adds flexibility to the traditional [whole life insurance](../w/whole_life_insurance.md) model. It allows policyholders to adjust their [premium](../p/premium.md) payments and [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) amounts, given that there are sufficient funds in the policy's cash [value](../v/value.md) account. [Universal life insurance](../u/universal_life_insurance.md) policies also [accrue](../a/accrue.md) cash [value](../v/value.md), but the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) is often variable, based on prevailing [market](../m/market.md) rates or an [index](../i/index.md).

### Variable Life Insurance

[Variable life insurance](../v/variable_life_insurance.md) policies combine a [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) with investment [options](../o/options.md). Policyholders can allocate their premiums among various investment [options](../o/options.md), such as [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, or mutual funds. The cash [value](../v/value.md) and [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) of the policy can fluctuate based on the performance of these investments. This type of policy offers the potential for higher returns but also carries higher risks.

### Indexed Universal Life Insurance

Indexed [universal life insurance](../u/universal_life_insurance.md) is a type of [universal life insurance](../u/universal_life_insurance.md) where the cash [value](../v/value.md) growth is tied to a stock [market index](../m/market_index.md), like the S&P 500. Policyholders can benefit from [market](../m/market.md) gains while generally having a cap and floor on returns to protect against significant losses.

## Key Features

### Death Benefit

The primary feature of a permanent [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policy is the [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md), a guaranteed [lump-sum payment](../l/lump-sum_payment.md) made to the beneficiaries upon the insured's death. This benefit can help cover costs such as funeral expenses, outstanding debts, and [estate](../e/estate.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md).

### Premiums

Premiums for permanent [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) are typically higher than those for [term life insurance](../t/term_life_insurance.md) because they cover a longer time frame and contribute towards cash [value](../v/value.md) accumulation. Premiums can be fixed or flexible depending on the type of policy.

### Cash Value

One of the distinguishing features of permanent [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) is its cash [value](../v/value.md) component, which acts as a [savings account](../s/savings_account.md) that grows on a [tax-deferred](../t/tax_deferred.md) [basis](../b/basis.md). Policyholders can access this cash [value](../v/value.md) through loans or withdrawals, although these can affect the [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md).

### Dividends

Some permanent [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policies, particularly [whole life insurance](../w/whole_life_insurance.md), may pay annual dividends. These dividends can be used in various ways, such as purchasing additional coverage, reducing future premiums, or simply enhancing the policy’s cash [value](../v/value.md).

## Advantages

### Lifetime Coverage

The most significant advantage of permanent [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) is that it provides coverage for the insured's entire life, ensuring that beneficiaries [will](../w/will.md) receive a [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) regardless of when the policyholder dies.

### Tax Advantages

The cash [value](../v/value.md) component of a permanent [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policy grows on a [tax-deferred](../t/tax_deferred.md) [basis](../b/basis.md). Additionally, the [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) is generally paid out [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md) to beneficiaries.

### Wealth Accumulation

Permanent [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) acts as a forced savings mechanism. The cash [value](../v/value.md) that builds up over time can be accessed via loans or withdrawals, providing a financial resource that can be used during the policyholder's lifetime.

## Disadvantages

### Cost

Permanent [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policies are significantly more expensive than term life policies. The higher [premium](../p/premium.md) is required to cover the lifelong coverage and the cash [value](../v/value.md) accumulation.

### Complexity

Permanent [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policies can be more complicated than [term life insurance](../t/term_life_insurance.md) policies. They often require a deeper understanding of [options](../o/options.md), such as how to manage the cash [value](../v/value.md) or [dividend](../d/dividend.md) features.

### Surrender Charges

If a policyholder decides to cancel their permanent [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policy, they may be subject to surrender charges, which can reduce the amount of cash [value](../v/value.md) received.

## Riders and Customization

### Accelerated Death Benefit Rider

This [rider](../r/rider.md) allows policyholders to access a portion of the [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) if they are diagnosed with a terminal illness. This can provide much-needed financial support during a challenging time.

### Waiver of Premium Rider

If the policyholder becomes disabled and is unable to work, a [waiver of premium rider](../w/waiver_of_premium_rider.md) ensures that the [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) premiums [will](../w/will.md) be paid, keeping the policy in force.

### Long-Term Care Rider

This [rider](../r/rider.md) provides the policyholder with the option to use the [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) to cover the costs of long-term care services, which can be a significant financial burden in later years.

## Considerations When Choosing Permanent Life Insurance

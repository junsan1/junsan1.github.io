## Global Impact and Trends

### Economic and Political Influences

Economic growth, geopolitical stability, and currency fluctuations significantly influence the commodities market. For instance, political instability in an oil-producing country can lead to supply disruptions impacting global oil prices.

The impact of commodities production and trading on the environment is a growing concern. Companies are increasingly adopting sustainable practices and adhering to stricter environmental regulations.

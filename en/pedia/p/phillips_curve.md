# Phillips Curve

The Phillips Curve is a concept in [macroeconomics](../m/macroeconomics.md) that describes an empirical inverse relationship between the level of [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) and the rate of [inflation](../i/inflation.md) within an [economy](../e/economy.md). The curve suggests that with [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) comes [inflation](../i/inflation.md), which in turn should lead to lower [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md). The concept emerged from the work of [economist](../e/economist.md) A.W. Phillips, who, in 1958, published an influential study examining wage [inflation](../i/inflation.md) and [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) rates in the United Kingdom from 1861 to 1957.

## Origins and Historical Context

A.W. Phillips' groundbreaking paper was titled "The Relation between [Unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) and the Rate of Change of [Money](../m/money.md) Wage Rates in the United Kingdom, 1861-1957." Phillips demonstrated an inverse relationship between wage [inflation](../i/inflation.md) and [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md), arguing that when [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) was low, wages tended to rise quickly, and vice versa. This insight was subsequently generalized to the broader concept of the Phillips Curve, where the focus shifted from wage [inflation](../i/inflation.md) to price [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

In the mid-20th century, [econometrics](../e/econometrics_in_trading.md) was gaining prominence, and there was considerable [interest](../i/interest.md) in identifying empirical relationships that could help policymakers manage the [economy](../e/economy.md). The Phillips Curve became a cornerstone of [Keynesian economics](../k/keynesian_economics_in_trading.md), which dominated economic thought at the time.

## Theoretical Foundations

### Short-Run Phillips Curve

In the [short run](../s/short_run.md), the Phillips Curve depicts an inverse relationship between [inflation](../i/inflation.md) and [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md). The rationale is that with higher [demand](../d/demand.md) for goods and services, producers raise prices, which leads to [inflation](../i/inflation.md). Simultaneously, increased [demand](../d/demand.md) prompts firms to hire more workers, reducing [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md). This relationship suggests that policymakers could exploit this [trade](../t/trade.md)-off by encouraging higher [inflation](../i/inflation.md) to reduce [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md).

### Long-Run Phillips Curve

In the [long run](../l/long_run.md), however, the Phillips Curve is thought to be vertical, according to the Natural Rate Hypothesis put forth by [Milton Friedman](../m/milton_friedman.md) and Edmund Phelps during the late 1960s. They argued that the [labor market](../l/labor_market.md) would eventually reach a natural rate of [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md), which is consistent with stable [inflation](../i/inflation.md). According to this view, any attempt to lower [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) below this natural rate through [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) would only result in accelerating [inflation](../i/inflation.md), with [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) eventually returning to its natural rate.

### Expectations-Augmented Phillips Curve

Friedman and Phelps also introduced the concept of adaptive expectations, which suggests that people's expectations of future [inflation](../i/inflation.md) adjust based on past experiences of [inflation](../i/inflation.md). If workers and firms expect higher [inflation](../i/inflation.md), they [will](../w/will.md) adjust their wage demands and price-setting behavior, shifting the short-run Phillips Curve upward.

## Empirical Evidence and Evolution

### 1960s and 1970s

During the 1960s, many Western economies seemed to exhibit the [trade](../t/trade.md)-off described by the Phillips Curve, leading policymakers to utilize it as a guide for monetary and fiscal policies aimed at managing [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) and [inflation](../i/inflation.md). However, the 1970s presented a challenge to the Phillips Curve concept as economies around the world experienced [stagflation](../s/stagflation.md)â€”a situation characterized by high [inflation](../i/inflation.md) and high [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md), which the original Phillips Curve could not explain.

### The Role of Supply Shocks

Economists realized that [supply](../s/supply.md)-side factors, such as oil shocks, could shift the Phillips Curve. The 1970s oil crises, for example, significantly increased [production costs](../p/production_costs.md), leading to both higher [inflation](../i/inflation.md) and higher [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md), which contradicted the simplistic [trade](../t/trade.md)-off suggested by the original Phillips Curve.

### The Lucas Critique

[Economist](../e/economist.md) Robert Lucas further criticized the Phillips Curve by arguing that any apparent [trade](../t/trade.md)-offs between [inflation](../i/inflation.md) and [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) could not be systematically exploited by policymakers. He posited that once individuals and firms adjusted their expectations to anticipated policy interventions, the relationship would break down. This critique led to the development of New [Classical economics](../c/classical_economics.md) and models emphasizing rational expectations.

## The Phillips Curve in Modern Macroeconomics

### New Keynesian Phillips Curve

The New Keynesian Phillips Curve incorporates elements of both sticky prices and rational expectations. According to this model, prices are slow to adjust to changes in [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md) due to [nominal](../n/nominal.md) rigidities such as [menu costs](../m/menu_costs.md) or long-term contracts. Even so, firms and households are assumed to form expectations about [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rationally, based on all available information. This framework helps to explain why the relationship between [inflation](../i/inflation.md) and [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) may [hold](../h/hold.md) in the [short run](../s/short_run.md) but not necessarily in the [long run](../l/long_run.md).

### Policy Implications

Modern central banks often use a version of the Phillips Curve when conducting [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md), although they recognize its limitations. [Inflation](../i/inflation.md) targeting has become a common [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) strategy, where central banks aim to keep [inflation](../i/inflation.md) around a specific target, usually 2%. By doing so, they hope to minimize fluctuations in [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) and stabilize [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md).

### Empirical Challenges

In recent years, the empirical relationship between [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) and [inflation](../i/inflation.md) has appeared to weaken. This phenomenon, sometimes referred to as the "flattening of the Phillips Curve," suggests that changes in [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) have a much smaller effect on [inflation](../i/inflation.md) than they did in the past. Several reasons have been proposed for this change, including [globalization](../g/globalization.md), technological advancements, and changes in [labor market](../l/labor_market.md) structures.

## Conclusion

The Phillips Curve remains a fundamental concept in [macroeconomics](../m/macroeconomics.md), encapsulating the complex interactions between [inflation](../i/inflation.md) and [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md). While its empirical validity and theoretical foundations have evolved over time, it continues to [offer](../o/offer.md) valuable insights for policymakers and economists alike. Understanding the nuances of the Phillips Curve can help in the formulation of more effective economic policies aimed at balancing the often conflicting goals of low [inflation](../i/inflation.md) and low [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md).

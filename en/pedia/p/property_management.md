# Property Management

Property management is the operation, control, and oversight of [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) as used in its most broad terms. Management indicates a need to be cared for, monitored, and accountability given for its usable life and condition. This is much akin to the role of management in any [business](../b/business.md).

## Understanding Property Management

Property management encompasses the administration of residential, commercial, and industrial [real estate](../r/real_estate.md). This can include apartments, detached houses, condominium units, and shopping centers. [Investing](../i/investing.md) in a brick-and-mortar [asset](../a/asset.md) often means committing to the maintenance and care involved in managing that property. Property managers act on behalf of the owner to preserve the [value](../v/value.md) of the property while generating [income](../i/income.md).

The function and [scope](../s/scope.md) of property management include managing tenants, collecting rent, handling maintenance requests, overseeing repairs, and confronting problematic tenants. A property manager can be an individual or a [firm](../f/firm.md) that works directly with buildings and residents.

## Key Responsibilities

### Legal Compliance

Property managers must ensure that the property complies with local, state, and federal regulations.

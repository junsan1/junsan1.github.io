# Property Management

Property management is the operation, control, and oversight of real estate as used in its most broad terms. Management indicates a need to be cared for, monitored, and accountability given for its usable life and condition. This is much akin to the role of management in any business.

## Understanding Property Management

Property management encompasses the administration of residential, commercial, and industrial real estate. This can include apartments, detached houses, condominium units, and shopping centers. Investing in a brick-and-mortar asset often means committing to the maintenance and care involved in managing that property. Property managers act on behalf of the owner to preserve the value of the property while generating income.

The function and scope of property management include managing tenants, collecting rent, handling maintenance requests, overseeing repairs, and confronting problematic tenants. A property manager can be an individual or a firm that works directly with buildings and residents.

## Key Responsibilities

### Tenant Management

Managing tenants is one of the core parts of property management. This includes finding and screening tenants, setting up lease agreements, collecting rent, handling tenant inquiries and complaints, and addressing any conflicts that arise. 

### Lease Administration

Lease administration involves managing the terms of leases, ensuring compliance with lease terms, and addressing lease renewals and terminations. Property managers need to understand lease agreements, negotiate terms, and ensure they align with regulatory requirements.

### Maintenance and Repairs

Maintaining the property in a safe and habitable condition is a critical responsibility. This includes routine maintenance, emergency repairs, and periodic renovations or upgrades. Property managers must coordinate with a variety of service providers and contractors to ensure the property is well-maintained.

### Financial Management

Property managers are responsible for budgeting, accounting, and fiscal management of the real estate asset. This involves setting rental rates, collecting rent, paying property expenses, and preparing financial reports for the property owner. They also ensure that property taxes, insurance, and other financial obligations are met.

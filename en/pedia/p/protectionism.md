# Protectionism

Protectionism is an economic policy aimed at restricting imports from other countries through methods such as tariffs, [import](../i/import.md) [quotas](../q/quota.md), and a variety of other government regulations. The rationale behind protectionism is generally to protect domestic industries from foreign competition and to maintain higher domestic employment levels. This policy can be a topic of heated debate among economists and policymakers, as it has both supporters and opponents with strong arguments on either side.

## Historical Context

Protectionism has a long history and has been applied in various forms throughout different eras. One of the earliest examples can be traced back to [mercantilism](../m/mercantilism.md) in the 16th to 18th centuries, when European nations sought to build [wealth](../w/wealth.md) through the accumulation of gold and silver by maximizing exports and minimizing imports. 

In the modern era, various forms of protectionist policies have been seen:
- **The [Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act](../s/smoot-hawley_tariff_act.md) of 1930**: Enacted during the [Great Depression](../g/great_depression.md), this act raised U.S. tariffs on over 20,000 imported goods. While it intended to protect American jobs, it is widely believed to have deepened the global economic downturn.
- **[Import](../i/import.md) Substitution [Industrialization](../i/industrialization.md) (ISI)**: Adopted in many Latin American countries in the mid-20th century, ISI aimed to reduce dependency on imported goods by fostering domestic industries.

## Common Protectionist Measures

### Tariffs

Tariffs are [taxes](../t/taxes.md) imposed on imported goods, making them more expensive compared to domestically produced goods. There are two main types of tariffs:
- **Specific Tariffs**: A fixed [fee](../f/fee.md) based on the type of item, such as $1,000 per car.
- **Ad Valorem Tariffs**: A percentage of the item's [value](../v/value.md), such as 10% of the [value](../v/value.md) of a car.

### Import Quotas

[Import](../i/import.md) [quotas](../q/quota.md) restrict the number or [value](../v/value.md) of specific goods that can be imported into a country. This helps to limit the availability of foreign goods, thus encouraging consumers to buy domestic products.

### Subsidies

Subsidies are government payments to domestic industries to help them compete against foreign imports. These payments can take various forms, including direct financial support, tax benefits, and low-[interest](../i/interest.md) loans.

### Non-Tariff Barriers

Non-[tariff](../t/tariff.md) barriers include a variety of regulations and standards that make it more difficult for foreign goods to compete. These could be:
- **Technical standards**: Requirements for quality and safety that foreign products must meet.
- **Custom procedures**: Complicated and time-consuming customs procedures can act as barriers to [trade](../t/trade.md).

### Currency Manipulation

Some countries may engage in [currency](../c/currency.md) manipulation to make their exports cheaper and imports more expensive. This is done by artificially keeping the [currency](../c/currency.md) [value](../v/value.md) low relative to other currencies.

## Pros and Cons of Protectionism

### Pros

1. **Protects domestic jobs**: By restricting imports, domestic industries face less competition from foreign companies, potentially saving local jobs.
2. **Promotes domestic growth**: New or struggling industries may have the opportunity to grow without the pressure of foreign competition.
3. **National [security](../s/security.md)**: Some industries are crucial for national [security](../s/security.md) and should be protected from external pressures.
4. **[Revenue](../r/revenue.md) generation**: Governments can generate [revenue](../r/revenue.md) through tariffs.

### Cons

1. **Higher prices for consumers**: Protectionist policies often lead to higher prices for goods and services because there is less competition.
2. **Retaliation**: Other countries may respond with their own protectionist measures, leading to a [trade war](../t/trade_war.md).
3. **Inefficiency**: Protectionism can lead to inefficiency and lack of innovation within protected industries.
4. **Global inequality**: It can exacerbate global inequality by hindering the [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) of developing countries that rely on exports.

## Notable Examples

### United States-China Trade War

The [trade war](../t/trade_war.md) between the United States and China is a recent example of extensive protectionist measures. The conflict began in 2018 when the U.S. implemented tariffs on Chinese goods, accusing China of unfair [trade](../t/trade.md) practices such as intellectual property theft. In response, China imposed its own tariffs on American goods. This [trade war](../t/trade_war.md) affected global [supply](../s/supply.md) chains and had significant impacts on both economies.

### Brexit

The United Kingdom's exit from the [European Union](../e/european_union_(eu).md), commonly known as [Brexit](../b/brexit.md), is another example of protectionism. While primarily a political move, [Brexit](../b/brexit.md) has significant economic implications, as the UK seeks to impose its own [trade](../t/trade.md) policies and regulations separate from the EU.

## Economic Theories and Models

### Infant Industry Argument

One of the oldest arguments for protectionism is the infant [industry](../i/industry.md) argument, which suggests that new industries may need temporary protection from established foreign competitors until they become mature and competitive.

### Strategic Trade Policy

Strategic [trade](../t/trade.md) policy aims to enhance national [interest](../i/interest.md) by supporting certain domestic industries that have the potential for high returns, particularly those that can create significant positive externalities or have strategic importance.

### Neo-mercantilism

Neo-[mercantilism](../m/mercantilism.md) focuses on achieving a favorable balance of [trade](../t/trade.md) by using protectionist policies to boost exports and restrict imports. It builds on the classical mercantilist idea of accumulating [wealth](../w/wealth.md) through [trade](../t/trade.md) surpluses.

## Criticisms and Controversies

### Economic Efficiency

Critics argue that protectionism leads to a misallocation of resources, making protected industries inefficient. Without competition, domestic industries may lack incentives to innovate and improve.

### Trade Wars

Protectionist measures often lead to [trade](../t/trade.md) wars, as affected countries retaliate by imposing their own tariffs and restrictions. These conflicts can escalate, harming the global [economy](../e/economy.md) and reducing international [trade](../t/trade.md).

### Consumer Welfare

By increasing the prices of goods and reducing the variety available, protectionism can negatively impact consumer [welfare](../w/welfare.md). Higher prices mean that consumers have less [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md), leading to a lower [standard of living](../s/standard_of_living.md).

## Modern Trends

### Resurgence of Protectionism

In recent years, there has been a resurgence of protectionist policies, particularly in advanced economies. Factors contributing to this [trend](../t/trend.md) include populist political movements, economic nationalism, and concerns over [globalization](../g/globalization.md)'s impact on domestic jobs and industries.

### Tech and Digital Economies

The rise of the digital [economy](../e/economy.md) presents new challenges and considerations for protectionist policies. Issues such as data privacy, intellectual [property rights](../p/property_rights.md), and the global reach of tech giants require updated approaches to economic protectionism.

### Regionalism vs. Globalism

There is a growing tension between regional [trade](../t/trade.md) agreements and global [trade](../t/trade.md) organizations. Countries may prefer regional agreements that can be more easily negotiated and tailored to specific needs, potentially at the [expense](../e/expense.md) of broader global [trade](../t/trade.md) agreements.

## Policy Recommendations

### Balanced Approach

A balanced approach that considers both the benefits and downsides of protectionism is essential. Policymakers should aim for policies that protect key industries without excessively harming the broader [economy](../e/economy.md) or international relationships.

### Targeted Support

Rather than broad protectionist measures, targeted support for industries that are vital for national [security](../s/security.md) or have significant growth potential may be more effective. This support can include subsidies, research and development funding, and education programs to build a skilled workforce.

### International Cooperation

International cooperation and dialogue are crucial to managing the negative impacts of protectionism. [Trade](../t/trade.md) organizations and agreements can help mediate disputes and create a fairer global [trade](../t/trade.md) environment.

## Conclusion

Protectionism is a complex and multifaceted economic policy with significant implications for both domestic and global economies. While it can [offer](../o/offer.md) protection and growth opportunities for specific industries, it often comes with higher costs for consumers and potential retaliation from [trade](../t/trade.md) partners. A nuanced approach that balances national interests with global cooperation is essential for maximizing the benefits and minimizing the downsides of protectionism.

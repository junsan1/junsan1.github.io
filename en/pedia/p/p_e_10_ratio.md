# P/E 10 Ratio

The Price-to-[Earnings](../e/earnings.md) (P/E) ratio is one of the most commonly used metrics in [equity](../e/equity.md) [valuation](../v/valuation.md). It measures the current share price of a company relative to its per-share [earnings](../e/earnings.md). However, while the standard P/E ratio uses [earnings](../e/earnings.md) from the latest fiscal year, the P/E 10 ratio (also known as the [CAPE ratio](../c/cape_ratio.md) or Shiller P/E ratio) takes a longer-term perspective by averaging [earnings](../e/earnings.md) over the past ten years. This approach aims to smooth out the [volatility](../v/volatility.md) that can occur from year to year, providing a more stable and long-term [valuation](../v/valuation.md) metric.

## Introduction to P/E 10 Ratio

The P/E 10 ratio was popularized by Yale [economist](../e/economist.md) Robert Shiller, who argued that short-term [earnings](../e/earnings.md) can be highly volatile due to [business](../b/business.md) cycles and other factors. By using a 10-year average of [earnings](../e/earnings.md), the P/E 10 ratio adjusts for these fluctuations and provides a more consistent measure of whether a stock or the [stock market](../s/stock_market.md) in general is [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md) or [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md). 

### Formula for P/E 10 Ratio

The formula for the P/E 10 ratio is fairly straightforward:

\[ \text{P/E 10 Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Share Price}}{\text{Average [Inflation](../i/inflation.md)-Adjusted [Earnings](../e/earnings.md) of the Past 10 Years}} \]

### Calculating the P/E 10 Ratio

To calculate the P/E 10 ratio, follow these steps:

1. **Collect Historical [Earnings](../e/earnings.md) Data**: Obtain the company's [earnings](../e/earnings.md) data for the past ten years.
2. **Adjust for [Inflation](../i/inflation.md)**: Adjust these [earnings](../e/earnings.md) figures for [inflation](../i/inflation.md) to ensure consistency. This is usually done using a measure like the Consumer Price [Index](../i/index.md) (CPI).
3. **Calculate the Average**: Compute the average of the [inflation](../i/inflation.md)-adjusted [earnings](../e/earnings.md).
4. **Determine Current Share Price**: Find the current share price of the company.
5. **Divide Current Price by Average [Earnings](../e/earnings.md)**: Finally, divide the current share price by the 10-year average of [inflation](../i/inflation.md)-adjusted [earnings](../e/earnings.md).

### Importance of P/E 10 Ratio

The P/E 10 ratio is important for several reasons:

1. **Long-term Perspective**: By averaging [earnings](../e/earnings.md) over a decade, the P/E 10 ratio removes the [noise](../n/noise.md) of short-term [earnings](../e/earnings.md) spikes and troughs, providing a clearer view of long-term trends and valuations.
2. **[Economic Cycles](../e/economic_cycles.md)**: The 10-year average smooths out the effects of [economic cycles](../e/economic_cycles.md), making it easier to assess the true [value](../v/value.md) of a company or [market](../m/market.md).
3. **[Inflation](../i/inflation.md) Adjustment**: Adjusting for [inflation](../i/inflation.md) ensures that the [earnings](../e/earnings.md) figures are comparable over time, removing distortions caused by changing price levels.
4. **Historical Comparisons**: The P/E 10 ratio can be compared over long time periods to analyze whether markets or specific [stocks](../s/stock.md) are trading close to historical averages, helping to guide investment decisions.

### Case Study: The S&P 500 and P/E 10 Ratio

One prominent application of the P/E 10 ratio is its use in evaluating the [valuation](../v/valuation.md) of the S&P 500 [index](../i/index.md). Investors and analysts use the P/E 10 ratio to assess whether the U.S. [equity market](../e/equity_market.md) as a whole is [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md), [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md), or fairly valued. Historic data reveals that during periods of significant overvaluation, as indicated by a high P/E 10 ratio, the [market](../m/market.md) tends to experience corrections. Conversely, low P/E 10 ratios have historically preceded periods of [market](../m/market.md) growth.

### Limitations of the P/E 10 Ratio

Despite its advantages, the P/E 10 ratio is not without its limitations:

1. **Historical Data Dependence**: It relies on historical data, which may not fully capture future growth potential or changing [business](../b/business.md) conditions.
2. **[Inflation](../i/inflation.md) Metrics**: The method of [inflation](../i/inflation.md) adjustment (using CPI or another [index](../i/index.md)) can introduce its own biases.
3. **Sector Variations**: Different sectors have different average P/E 10 ratios due to variations in [growth rates](../g/growth_rates_in_trading.md), [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements, and other [industry](../i/industry.md)-specific factors.
4. **Regulatory and [Market](../m/market.md) Changes**: Changes in regulations, technological advancements, and macroeconomic shifts can all affect a company's [earnings](../e/earnings.md) in ways not reflected by historical figures.

## Applications in Algo-Trading

The P/E 10 ratio can be particularly useful in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) (algo-trading) strategies that rely on [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md). Here are some ways that algo-traders might incorporate the P/E 10 ratio:

### Value Investing Strategies

Algo-traders can design algorithms to screen for [stocks](../s/stock.md) with low P/E 10 ratios, indicating they may be [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md). These [stocks](../s/stock.md) can be targeted for long positions in anticipation of future price increases.

### Market Timing Signals

Traders can use the P/E 10 ratio of [market](../m/market.md) indices (e.g., S&P 500) as a signal for broader [market](../m/market.md) conditions. A very high P/E 10 ratio might prompt algorithms to reduce [market exposure](../m/market_exposure.md) or even short the [market](../m/market.md), anticipating a [correction](../c/correction.md).

### Risk Management

The P/E 10 ratio can be integrated into [risk management frameworks](../r/risk_management_frameworks.md). For example, algorithms can adjust position sizes based on the P/E 10 ratio, increasing [holdings](../h/holdings.md) in [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) markets and decreasing them in [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md) markets.

## Comparisons with Other Valuation Metrics

### P/E Ratio

- **Standard P/E Ratio**: Uses [earnings](../e/earnings.md) from the latest fiscal year, which can be highly volatile.
- **P/E 10 Ratio**: Uses a 10-year average of [inflation](../i/inflation.md)-adjusted [earnings](../e/earnings.md), providing a more stable [valuation](../v/valuation.md) metric.

### PEG Ratio

- **PEG Ratio**: Divides the P/E ratio by the growth rate of the company's [earnings](../e/earnings.md), adding a growth dimension to the assessment.
- **P/E 10 Ratio**: Focuses solely on [valuation](../v/valuation.md) without adjusting for growth, making it more suitable for long-term [value](../v/value.md) assessment.

### Price-to-Book Ratio

- **P/B Ratio**: Focuses on the company's [book value](../b/book_value.md) per share, providing a different perspective on [valuation](../v/valuation.md).
- **P/E 10 Ratio**: Focuses on [earnings](../e/earnings.md), [offering](../o/offering.md) insights into profitability and [operational efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md).

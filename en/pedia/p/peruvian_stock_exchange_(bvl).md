# Peruvian Stock Exchange (BVL)

## Overview

The Bolsa de Valores de Lima (BVL), or the Lima Stock Exchange, is the primary stock exchange in Peru. It was established in 1860 and is headquartered in Lima, the capital city.

Over the years, the BVL has grown to include a wider range of companies across various sectors, such as banking, utilities, and manufacturing.

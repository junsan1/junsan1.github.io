# Political Action Committee (Super PAC)

A Political Action Committee (PAC), and more specifically, a Super PAC, is a type of organization in the United States that collects political donations from members and then uses those funds to influence the outcome of federal elections, primarily through campaigning. These organizations play a crucial role in the American political system by enabling individuals, corporations, and unions to support their preferred candidates or political causes on a large scale.

## Introduction

Super PACs are a significant element in the landscape of American political [financing](../f/financing.md). They differ from traditional PACs (which are limited in the amount of [money](../m/money.md) they can donate directly to candidates) in that they can raise and spend unlimited sums of [money](../m/money.md). This freedom allows them to exert substantial influence over the political process.

The development of Super PACs is rooted in two critical legal decisions:

1. **Citizens United v. Federal Election [Commission](../c/commission.md) (2010)**: This Supreme Court decision ruled that corporate funding of independent political broadcasts in candidate elections cannot be limited under the First Amendment, effectively allowing corporations and unions to spend unlimited amounts of [money](../m/money.md) on campaigning.
2. **SpeechNow.org v. Federal Election [Commission](../c/commission.md) (2010)**: Following Citizens United, this Court of Appeals decision allowed individuals to donate unlimited amounts of [money](../m/money.md) to independent-expenditure only committees, which we now know as Super PACs.

## Structure and Function of Super PACs

### Formation and Registration

Super PACs must register with the Federal Election [Commission](../c/commission.md) (FEC). They file a Statement of Organization (Form 1) and receive an FEC identification number. The Super PAC then begins to accept contributions and make expenditures.

### Fundraising and Contributions

Unlike traditional PACs, which have strict limits on the contributions they can receive, Super PACs can accept unlimited contributions from individuals, corporations, labor unions, and other political committees. This fundraising capability is crucial for their impact on political campaigns.

### Disclosure Requirements

Super PACs are required to regularly disclose their donors and expenditures to the FEC. This [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) provides some level of [transparency](../t/transparency.md) regarding who is funding different political messages and campaigns. However, the rise of "dark [money](../m/money.md)" groups, which donate to Super PACs without revealing their own funding sources, has clouded this [transparency](../t/transparency.md).

### Expenditures and Activities

Super PACs primarily spend [money](../m/money.md) on political advertising, including television commercials, digital ads, and mailers. They can also engage in other activities such as voter outreach and research. However, they are forbidden from directly coordinating with the candidates or campaigns they support. This rule is intended to maintain a degree of separation between Super PACs and official campaign organizations, though the enforcement of this rule can be challenging.

## Impact on Elections and Political Landscape

### Advantages

- **Amplified Voices**: Super PACs amplify the voices of wealthy individuals, corporations, and unions, allowing them to have substantial influence on the political discourse and election outcomes.
- **Resource Allocation**: They enable massive fundraising that can be strategically spent in support of or against candidates, especially in competitive and closely contested races.

### Criticisms

- **Influence of [Money](../m/money.md) in Politics**: Critics argue that Super PACs exacerbate the influence of [money](../m/money.md) in politics, drowning out the voices of average voters.
- **Potential Corruption**: There are concerns about corruption and the potential for wealthy donors and organizations to exert [undue influence](../u/undue_influence.md) over elected officials and policy decisions.
- **Lack of [Transparency](../t/transparency.md)**: Despite [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) requirements, the presence of dark [money](../m/money.md) obscures the true sources of funding, complicating efforts to track and understand the flow of political [money](../m/money.md).

### Regulatory Challenges

Regulating Super PACs is complex and continually evolving. The FEC is tasked with enforcement, but limited resources and political deadlock often hamper effective oversight. Additionally, legal challenges and the rapid pace of campaign innovation create ongoing regulatory hurdles.

### Case Studies

Examining specific examples of Super PACs can provide insight into their operation and impact:

- **Restore Our Future**: A Super PAC that supported Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign, raising over $142 million.
- **Priorities USA Action**: Initially founded to support Barack Obama's re-election, it later became a key player in supporting Democratic presidential candidates.

## Ethical and Legal Considerations

The ethics and legality of Super PACs are hotly debated topics. Questions about the balance between free speech and fair elections, the role of corporate [money](../m/money.md) in politics, and the definitions of corruption and [undue influence](../u/undue_influence.md) are central to this debate. Legal challenges and potential reforms are part of the ongoing effort to address these complex issues.

## Conclusion

Super PACs are a powerful force in American politics, reshaping the way campaigns are funded and conducted. While they enable significant political participation and resource mobilization, they also raise critical questions about the role of [money](../m/money.md) in democratic processes, [transparency](../t/transparency.md), and the potential for corruption. Understanding Super PACs, their functions, and their impact is essential for anyone engaged in or studying political science, law, or public policy.

The future of Super PACs [will](../w/will.md) likely involve continued legal battles, regulatory adjustments, and evolving strategies by political actors. As the political landscape shifts, the role of these organizations [will](../w/will.md) remain a crucial and contentious part of American elections.

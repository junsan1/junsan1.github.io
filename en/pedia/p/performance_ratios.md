# Performance Ratios

## Introduction
Performance ratios are crucial metrics in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) used to evaluate the [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md), profitability, and [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted returns of [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md). They help traders and investors compare [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) and make informed decisions. This document explores some of the most common performance ratios used in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md).

## Sharpe Ratio
The [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) is one of the most widely used metrics to measure the [risk-adjusted return](../r/risk-adjusted_return.md) of an investment. It is defined as the ratio of the [excess return](../e/excess_return.md) ([return](../r/return.md) above the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate) to the [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) of the investment returns.

\[ \text{[Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md)} = \frac{\text{Rp} - \text{Rf}}{\text{σp}} \]

Where:
- Rp = [Return](../r/return.md) of the portfolio
- Rf = [Risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate
- σp = [Standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) of the portfolio returns

The higher the [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md), the better the [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted performance of the portfolio or [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md).

## Sortino Ratio
The [Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md) is a variation of the [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) that differentiates harmful [volatility](../v/volatility.md) from overall [volatility](../v/volatility.md). It assesses the [return](../r/return.md) of an investment relative to the [downside risk](../d/downside_risk.md).

\[ \text{[Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md)} = \frac{\text{Rp} - \text{Rf}}{\text{σd}} \]

Where:
- Rp = [Return](../r/return.md) of the portfolio
- Rf = [Risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate
- σd = [Downside deviation](../d/downside_deviation.md) of the portfolio returns

The [downside deviation](../d/downside_deviation.md) considers only the returns falling below a minimum acceptable [return](../r/return.md) (MAR), providing a more realistic measure of [risk](../r/risk.md).

## Calmar Ratio
The Calmar Ratio measures the [risk-adjusted return](../r/risk-adjusted_return.md) of an investment by comparing the average annual compounded [rate of return](../r/rate_of_return.md) to the maximum [drawdown](../d/drawdown.md) over the same period.

\[ \text{Calmar Ratio} = \frac{\text{CAGR}}{\text{Max [Drawdown](../d/drawdown.md)}} \]

Where:
- CAGR = Compound Annual Growth Rate
- Max [Drawdown](../d/drawdown.md) = Maximum observed loss from a peak to a [trough](../t/trough.md)

A higher Calmar Ratio indicates a better performance where gains are achieved with minimal drawdowns.

## Treynor Ratio
The [Treynor Ratio](../t/treynor_ratio.md) measures the [return](../r/return.md) earned in excess of the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate per unit of [market risk](../m/market_risk.md). This ratio builds on the [Capital Asset](../c/capital_asset.md) Pricing Model (CAPM).

\[ \text{[Treynor Ratio](../t/treynor_ratio.md)} = \frac{\text{Rp} - \text{Rf}}{\text{βp}} \]

Where:
- Rp = [Return](../r/return.md) of the portfolio
- Rf = [Risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate
- βp = [Beta](../b/beta.md) of the portfolio (a measure of [market risk](../m/market_risk.md))

A higher [Treynor Ratio](../t/treynor_ratio.md) indicates better utilization of [market risk](../m/market_risk.md) in generating returns.

## Information Ratio
The [Information Ratio](../i/information_ratio.md) measures a [portfolio manager](../p/portfolio_manager.md)'s ability to generate excess returns relative to a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md), adjusted for the [risk](../r/risk.md) taken.

\[ \text{[Information Ratio](../i/information_ratio.md)} = \frac{\text{Rp} - \text{Rb}}{\text{[Tracking Error](../t/tracking_error.md)}} \]

Where:
- Rp = [Return](../r/return.md) of the portfolio
- Rb = [Return](../r/return.md) of the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md)
- [Tracking Error](../t/tracking_error.md) = [Standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) of the difference between portfolio returns and [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) returns

A higher [Information Ratio](../i/information_ratio.md) suggests better performance of the [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) compared to its [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md).

## Omega Ratio
The [Omega](../o/omega.md) Ratio evaluates the ratio of gains to losses above a threshold [return](../r/return.md) level, providing a more comprehensive view of [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md).

\[ \text{[Omega](../o/omega.md) Ratio} = \frac{\int_{\text{threshold}}^{\infty} [1 - F(x)]dx}{\int_{-\infty}^{\text{threshold}} F(x)dx} \]

Where:
- F(x) = [Cumulative distribution function](../c/cumulative_distribution_function_in_trading.md) of returns

A higher [Omega](../o/omega.md) Ratio signifies that the [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) offers more favorable returns compared to losses.

## Ulcer Index
The Ulcer [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) measures the depth and [duration](../d/duration.md) of drawdowns in a [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md). It's useful for understanding the level of stress or "ulcer" a [trader](../t/trader.md) may experience.

\[ \text{Ulcer Index} = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^{N} \left( \frac{\text{[Drawdown](../d/drawdown.md)}_t}{\text{Max Price}} \right)^2 } \]

The lower the Ulcer [Index](../i/index_instrument.md), the less severe and frequent the drawdowns, indicating a more stable [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md).

## Maximum Drawdown
Maximum [Drawdown](../d/drawdown.md) (MDD) quantifies the largest peak-to-[trough](../t/trough.md) decline in the [value](../v/value.md) of a [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) or portfolio. It provides an indication of historical [risk](../r/risk.md).

\[ \text{Maximum [Drawdown](../d/drawdown.md)} = \frac{\text{[Trough](../t/trough.md) [Value](../v/value.md)} - \text{Peak [Value](../v/value.md)}}{\text{Peak [Value](../v/value.md)}} \]

A smaller MDD is preferred, as it indicates less potential loss from peak to [trough](../t/trough.md).

## Conclusion
Understanding and applying these performance ratios allow algorithmic traders to better evaluate their [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), manage risks, and improve returns. These ratios are integral to ensuring a coherent and comprehensive analysis of algorithm performance in the complex landscape of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

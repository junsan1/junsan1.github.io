# Pro Forma Invoice

A [pro forma](../p/pro_forma.md) [invoice](../i/invoice.md) is a preliminary bill of [sale](../s/sale.md) sent to buyers in advance of a shipment or delivery of goods. The term "[pro forma](../p/pro_forma.md)" is derived from Latin, meaning "for the sake of form" or "as a matter of form." This document typically includes details about the items being shipped, such as descriptions, quantities, and pricing. Unlike a commercial [invoice](../i/invoice.md), which is issued once a [sale](../s/sale.md) is finalized, a [pro forma](../p/pro_forma.md) [invoice](../i/invoice.md) is used primarily for informational or estimation purposes, to declare the [value](../v/value.md) of the [trade](../t/trade.md) and to ensure that all parties are on the same page.

## Purpose and Functions

### Estimation and Quotation

A [pro forma](../p/pro_forma.md) [invoice](../i/invoice.md) provides an estimate of the cost of goods or services to be provided. It essentially functions as a [quotation](../q/quotation.md) that can be used to negotiate terms before a final agreement is reached. This can be particularly important for international transactions where buyers need to know the total cost, including shipping and potential customs duties.

### Legal and Financial Documentation

Although a [pro forma](../p/pro_forma.md) [invoice](../i/invoice.md) is not a binding agreement, it provides an initial framework that can help both buyers and sellers fulfill legal and financial requirements. For instance, banks may require a [pro forma](../p/pro_forma.md) [invoice](../i/invoice.md) to process a [letter of credit](../l/letter_of_credit.md) or other forms of [payment](../p/payment.md) guarantees.

### Customs and Importing

In international [trade](../t/trade.md), a [pro forma](../p/pro_forma.md) [invoice](../i/invoice.md) can serve as a key document for customs purposes. Customs authorities may use this document to calculate duties and [taxes](../t/taxes.md) on imported items. It also helps in securing [import](../i/import.md) permits and other necessary documentation.

### Inventory and Supply Chain Management

In the context of [inventory](../i/inventory.md) and [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md) management, a [pro forma](../p/pro_forma.md) [invoice](../i/invoice.md) helps businesses manage stock levels and plan for incoming shipments. This is particularly useful for businesses dealing with long lead times or just-in-time [inventory](../i/inventory.md) systems.

# Piotroski Score

The Piotroski Score is a metric used in [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md) to assess the financial strength and performance of a company based on its [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md). Developed by Joseph D. Piotroski, an [accounting](../a/accounting.md) professor at Stanford University, the score aims to identify fundamentally strong companies that are likely to be good investment opportunities, especially among [value](../v/value.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md).

The Piotroski Score ranges from 0 to 9, with each point representing one of nine binary criteria that can be met or not met. These criteria are divided into three main areas: profitability, [leverage](../l/leverage.md)/[liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)/source of funds, and operating [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md). Each criterion is assigned a [value](../v/value.md) of either 1 (the condition is met) or 0 (the condition is not met). The total score is then calculated as the sum of all nine binary values.

## Criteria Breakdown

### Profitability

1. **Net [Income](../i/income.md) (NI):** A positive net [income](../i/income.md) gives the company 1 point. This criterion assesses the company's ability to generate [profit](../p/profit.md).
   
   *Formula:* 
   ```plaintext
   if (Net [Income](../i/income.md) > 0) Point = 1 else Point = 0
   ```

2. **Operating [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md) (OCF):** Positive [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) from operations is another [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of [financial health](../f/financial_health.md). A positive OCF earns the company 1 point.
   
   *Formula:* 
   ```plaintext
   if (Operating [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md) > 0) Point = 1 else Point = 0
   ```

3. **[Return on Assets](../r/return_on_assets_(roa).md) (ROA):** This ratio represents the company's ability to use its assets to generate [earnings](../e/earnings.md). A positive ROA signifies effective [asset](../a/asset.md) utilization and earns 1 point.
   
   *Formula:* 
   ```plaintext
   if (ROA > 0) Point = 1 else Point = 0
   ```

4. **[Quality of Earnings](../q/quality_of_earnings.md) (QoE):** This criterion checks whether the [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) from operations is greater than net [income](../i/income.md), indicating high-quality [earnings](../e/earnings.md). If OCF > NI, the company gets 1 point.
   
   *Formula:* 
   ```plaintext
   if (Operating [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md) > Net [Income](../i/income.md)) Point = 1 else Point = 0
   ```

### Leverage, Liquidity, and Source of Funds

5. **[Current Ratio](../c/current_ratio.md) (CR):** This assesses the company's short-term [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md). An increase in the [current ratio](../c/current_ratio.md) relative to the previous year earns the company 1 point.
   
   *Formula:* 
   ```plaintext
   if (CR_CurrentYear > CR_PreviousYear) Point = 1 else Point = 0
   ```

6. **[Leverage](../l/leverage.md) (D/E):** This criterion examines the change in [leverage](../l/leverage.md) or [financial structure](../f/financial_structure.md). If the [leverage ratio](../l/leverage_ratio.md) ([debt](../d/debt.md) to [equity](../e/equity.md)) decreases compared to the previous year, the company earns 1 point.
   
   *Formula:* 
   ```plaintext
   if (D/E_CurrentYear < D/E_PreviousYear) Point = 1 else Point = 0
   ```

7. **Share Issuance:** If the company has not issued new [shares](../s/shares.md) over the past year, it earns 1 point. This indicates that the company is not diluting its existing shareholders.
   
   *Formula:* 
   ```plaintext
   if (SharesIssued_LastYear == 0) Point = 1 else Point = 0
   ```

### Operating Efficiency

8. **[Gross Margin](../g/gross_margin.md) (GM):** An increasing [gross margin](../g/gross_margin.md) compared to the previous year indicates improved [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and management effectiveness. An increase earns the company 1 point.
   
   *Formula:* 
   ```plaintext
   if (GM_CurrentYear > GM_PreviousYear) Point = 1 else Point = 0
   ```

9. **[Asset Turnover Ratio](../a/asset_turnover_ratio.md) (ATO):** This assesses the [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) of [asset](../a/asset.md) utilization. An increasing [asset turnover ratio](../a/asset_turnover_ratio.md) compared to the previous year earns the company 1 point.
   
   *Formula:* 
   ```plaintext
   if (ATO_CurrentYear > ATO_PreviousYear) Point = 1 else Point = 0
   ```

## Implementation in Trading and Investing

The Piotroski Score is predominantly used in [value investing strategies](../v/value_investing_strategies.md) to filter out [stocks](../s/stock.md) that may seem cheap but are fundamentally weak. Investors and traders use the score to focus on companies with [robust](../r/robust.md) [financial health](../f/financial_health.md), increasing the likelihood of profitable investments. Here's how it can be integrated into various strategies:

### Value Investing

[Value](../v/value.md) investors who follow strategies similar to those advocated by [Benjamin Graham](../b/benjamin_graham.md) and Warren Buffett may use the Piotroski Score as an additional filter for selecting [stocks](../s/stock.md). By focusing on companies with high Piotroski Scores, investors aim to reduce the [risk](../r/risk.md) of picking financially weak companies that may [underperform](../u/underperform.md) or even go bankrupt.

### Financial Screening

Institutional investors and mutual funds often employ financial screening techniques to sort through large pools of potential investments. The Piotroski Score can be a valuable tool in this process, allowing analysts to efficiently identify companies with sound financial metrics.

### Quantitative Analysis

For quantitatively-driven traders and [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds, the Piotroski Score can be incorporated into [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) models. These models can automate the process of scoring companies and making [trade](../t/trade.md) decisions based on predefined criteria. For example:

1. **Building a Scoring Algorithm:**
   An algorithm can automatically fetch financial data for a specific universe of [stocks](../s/stock.md), compute the Piotroski Score for each, and rank them accordingly.

2. **[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md):**
   Historical performance can be backtested to validate the effectiveness of using the Piotroski Score in isolation or in combination with other indicators.

### Risk Management

By incorporating the Piotroski Score, traders, and investors can enhance their [risk management frameworks](../r/risk_management_frameworks.md). [Investing](../i/investing.md) in companies with higher scores reduces exposure to potentially distressed or poorly managed firms, improving the overall portfolio quality.

### Data Integration

Financial data providers such as [Bloomberg](../b/bloomberg.md), [Reuters](../r/reuters.md), and various FinTech platforms [offer](../o/offer.md) APIs that can be integrated into custom-built models to compute the Piotroski Score in real-time. This allows for more dynamic investment strategies and better response to [market](../m/market.md) changes.

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Screening for Strong Value Stocks
Mathew, a [value](../v/value.md) [investor](../i/investor.md), is currently looking through a list of 500 potential investments. He decides to apply the Piotroski Score as a filter. By calculating the score for all companies, he narrows the list down to the 50 highest-scoring [stocks](../s/stock.md). This process saves him time and effort, allowing him to focus only on the most promising candidates.

### Example 2: Enhancing Algorithmic Models
Lucas runs a [hedge fund](../h/hedge_fund.md) that relies on [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) models. He integrates the Piotroski Score into his existing model to enhance its stock selection criteria. By doing so, he observes an improvement in the model's [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md), such as [return](../r/return.md) on investment and [Sharpe ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md), after several months of [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) and live trading.

### Example 3: Improving Portfolio Quality
Eva, a [portfolio manager](../p/portfolio_manager.md), wants to improve the overall quality of her portfolio. She reviews each holding's Piotroski Score and decides to divest [stocks](../s/stock.md) with scores below 4. In their place, she invests in companies scoring 7 and above. Over the following year, Eva notes a marked improvement in her portfolio's performance and stability.

## Criticisms and Limitations

While the Piotroski Score is a valuable tool, it is not without its criticisms and limitations:

1. **Simplistic Nature:**
   The score's binary structure may oversimplify complex financial realities, potentially ignoring nuanced aspects of a company’s [financial health](../f/financial_health.md).

2. **Limited Criteria [Scope](../s/scope.md):**
   It covers only a specific set of metrics and may miss other important financial indicators or qualitative aspects that could impact a company's performance.

3. **Sensitivity to [Market](../m/market.md) Conditions:**
   The score was developed in specific [market](../m/market.md) conditions and might not be fully applicable or as effective in different economic environments.

4. **One-Size-Fits-All Approach:**
   The Piotroski Score is applied uniformly across all companies, regardless of [industry](../i/industry.md) or size, which may not be ideal as different industries have different metrics of importance.

## Conclusion

The Piotroski Score is a powerful, yet straightforward tool for [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md) and stock selection. By focusing on key [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) indicators, it provides a clear, easy-to-interpret measure of a company’s fundamental strength. Whether used in traditional [value investing](../v/value_investing.md) or integrated into advanced [quantitative models](../q/quantitative_models.md), the Piotroski Score can significantly aid in identifying [robust](../r/robust.md) investment opportunities. However, like all tools, it is best used in conjunction with other analyses and metrics to provide a comprehensive view of potential investments.

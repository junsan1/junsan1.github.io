# Paga

**Paga** is a leading mobile [payment](../p/payment.md) and financial services platform based in Nigeria. Founded in 2009 by Tayo Oviosu, Paga aims to simplify the process of sending [money](../m/money.md) and making payments, particularly in regions where traditional banking [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) is inadequate or underdeveloped. It is a service that is deeply intertwined with the financial technology, or fintech, sector.

## History and Founding

Paga was founded in April 2009 by Tayo Oviosu, an engineering graduate from the University of Southern California and a former Associate at McKinsey & Company. The motivation behind creating Paga stemmed from the inefficiencies and challenges in the Nigerian financial systems where millions of people were underserved by traditional banking institutions. Oviosu envisioned a platform that would bridge the gap by [offering](../o/offering.md) accessible and reliable financial services.

## Business Model

Paga operates as a multi-channel network providing both digital and agent-driven financial services. Its [business](../b/business.md) model is designed to be inclusive, catering to a diverse user base that includes individuals with mobile phones (smartphones and feature phones) and those with limited access to the internet.

### Core Services

1. **[Money](../m/money.md) Transfers**: Paga enables users to send and receive [money](../m/money.md) domestically and internationally. Users can perform transactions via the Paga app on smartphones, USSD codes for feature phones, or through a network of agents.

2. **Bill Payments**: The platform offers a [robust](../r/robust.md) bill [payment](../p/payment.md) service, allowing users to pay for utilities, cable television, internet services, and more.

3. **Merchant Payments**: Paga supports merchants by providing tools to accept payments from customers seamlessly. This includes integration with e-[commerce](../c/commerce.md) platforms and point-of-[sale](../s/sale.md) (POS) systems.

4. **Savings and Loans**: Paga partners with various financial institutions to [offer](../o/offer.md) savings accounts and microloan services to its users, making banking services more accessible to the [unbanked](../u/unbanked.md) and [underbanked](../u/underbanked.md) populations.

5. **Airtime Purchases**: Users can top up their prepaid mobile phones or purchase airtime for others directly from the Paga platform.

6. **[Insurance](../i/insurance.md) Solutions**: Paga also offers [insurance](../i/insurance.md) products, making it easy for users to sign up for health and [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) plans.

## Technology Infrastructure

Paga's technology [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) is a critical component of its success. The platform is built on a scalable and secure technology stack that includes the following key elements:

### 1. **Mobile Platform**

Paga's mobile platform is designed with user accessibility and convenience in mind. It supports:
- **Smartphones**: Through the Paga mobile app available on both Android and iOS platforms. The app provides a user-friendly interface and a rich set of features.
- **Feature Phones**: Using USSD codes, Paga ensures that even users with non-smartphones can access its services. This extends the reach of Paga’s offerings to users in remote and rural areas.

### 2. **Encryption and Security**

[Security](../s/security.md) is paramount in financial services, and Paga utilizes advanced encryption technologies to protect user data and [transaction](../t/transaction.md) information. The platform adheres to stringent regulatory and [industry](../i/industry.md) standards to ensure the safety and privacy of its customers.

### 3. **Agent Network**

A distinctive feature of Paga is its extensive network of agents who facilitate cash-in and cash-out transactions. This network is crucial for serving users in regions with limited banking facilities. Agents are equipped with mobile devices and POS machines to assist customers in conducting transactions seamlessly.

### 4. **APIs for Integration**

Paga provides APIs that enable third-party developers to integrate its services into their own applications and platforms. This has been particularly useful for e-[commerce](../c/commerce.md) businesses and other fintech startups looking to [leverage](../l/leverage.md) Paga’s [payment](../p/payment.md) capabilities.

## Market Presence

While Paga primarily operates in Nigeria, it has ambitions to expand its services across Africa. The Nigerian [market](../m/market.md) presents a significant opportunity given its large population and the high number of [unbanked](../u/unbanked.md) individuals. However, Paga’s vision extends beyond Nigeria, as it aims to replicate its success in other African countries facing similar financial challenges.

## Partnerships and Collaborations

Strategic partnerships have been instrumental in Paga’s growth. The company collaborates with various banks, financial institutions, and technology providers to enhance its service offerings and expand its [market](../m/market.md) reach. Some notable partnerships include:

- **[Microfinance](../m/microfinance.md) Institutions**: Paga works with [microfinance](../m/microfinance.md) institutions to [offer](../o/offer.md) savings and [loan](../l/loan.md) products, thus fostering [financial inclusion](../f/financial_inclusion.md) for small [business](../b/business.md) owners and low-[income](../i/income.md) individuals.
- **[Insurtech](../i/insurtech.md) Companies**: Through partnerships with [insurance](../i/insurance.md) technology firms, Paga provides accessible and affordable [insurance](../i/insurance.md) products to its users.

Paga is licensed by the Central [Bank](../b/bank.md) of Nigeria (CBN) and adheres to the regulatory requirements set forth by the apex [bank](../b/bank.md). This includes anti-[money laundering](../m/money_laundering.md) (AML) protocols, know-your-[customer](../c/customer.md) (KYC) regulations, and other financial guidelines.

## Impact on Financial Inclusion

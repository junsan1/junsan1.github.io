# Penny Stock

[Penny stocks](../p/penny_stocks.md) generally refer to [shares](../s/shares.md) of small public companies that [trade](../t/trade.md) at low prices per share. In the United States, the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) defines [penny stocks](../p/penny_stocks.md) as those trading for less than $5 per share. Due to their low price, these [stocks](../s/stock.md) often attract novice investors who are looking for a way to make a quick [profit](../p/profit.md). However, [penny stocks](../p/penny_stocks.md) are also considered highly speculative and risky due to their lack of [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), wide [bid](../b/bid.md)-ask [spreads](../s/spreads.md), limited following, and small [capitalization](../c/capitalization.md). Therefore, [investing](../i/investing.md) in [penny stocks](../p/penny_stocks.md) requires a greater level of [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md).

## Characteristics of Penny Stocks

### Low Price Per Share
One of the most significant characteristics of [penny stocks](../p/penny_stocks.md) is their low price per share, often trading for less than $5. The low price can be enticing to investors looking for major gains but also means the stock can be highly volatile.

### Market Capitalization
[Penny stocks](../p/penny_stocks.md) usually belong to companies with small [market](../m/market.md) capitalizations. While there's no universal [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for what constitutes "small," most penny stock companies have [market](../m/market.md) capitalizations under $300 million.

### Limited Liquidity
[Penny stocks](../p/penny_stocks.md) typically have lower trading volumes and hence reduced [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) compared to blue-chip [stocks](../s/stock.md). Low [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) often results in wider [bid](../b/bid.md)-ask [spreads](../s/spreads.md), making it difficult to buy or sell [shares](../s/shares.md) at desired prices.

### Exchange Listings
[Penny stocks](../p/penny_stocks.md) are often traded over-the-counter (OTC) rather than on major exchanges like the NYSE or [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md). The OTC [market](../m/market.md) includes platforms like the OTC Bulletin Board (OTCBB) and the [Pink Sheets](../p/pink_sheets.md).

### Transparency and Reporting
Penny stock companies are often less transparent than their larger counterparts. Financial reporting standards can be more lenient, and information about these companies may not be as readily accessible or reliable.

### High Volatility
The low price and limited [trade](../t/trade.md) [volume](../v/volume.md) make [penny stocks](../p/penny_stocks.md) highly volatile. Prices can swing dramatically in short periods, often based on the release of minor or even false information.

## Advantages and Risks

### Advantages

#### High Potential for Returns
One of the most obvious advantages of trading [penny stocks](../p/penny_stocks.md) is the potential for substantial returns. If an [investor](../i/investor.md) picks the right stock, the percentage gains can be enormous.

#### Low Initial Investment
Given their low price, [penny stocks](../p/penny_stocks.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) an entry point for investors with limited [capital](../c/capital.md). This allows for [diversification](../d/diversification.md) even with a smaller [investment fund](../i/investment_fund.md).

#### Market Accessibility
Because they are often traded over-the-counter, [penny stocks](../p/penny_stocks.md) provide access to companies that are not [listed](../l/listed.md) on major exchanges, [offering](../o/offering.md) opportunities that are not available via traditional markets.

### Risks

#### Lack of Information
Due to the less stringent reporting requirements, finding reliable information on penny stock companies can be challenging. This information asymmetry increases the [risk](../r/risk.md) for the average [investor](../i/investor.md).

#### Fraud and Manipulation
[Penny stocks](../p/penny_stocks.md) are often the target of fraudulent schemes like "pump and dump," where promoters artificially inflate the stock price to sell their [shares](../s/shares.md) at high prices before the stock plummets.

#### Lack of Liquidity
The low trading volumes make it difficult to execute large orders without affecting the stock price. This [illiquidity](../i/illiquid.md) can also result in significant price [gaps](../g/gap.md).

#### Market Volatility
The high [volatility](../v/volatility.md) of [penny stocks](../p/penny_stocks.md) can lead to quick and severe price fluctuations, making these investments high-[risk](../r/risk.md) and suitable primarily for experienced traders.

## Regulations

The regulation of [penny stocks](../p/penny_stocks.md) is much stricter today than it was in the past, primarily because of the prevalence of fraudulent schemes involving these securities. 

### The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
In the United States, the SEC has made significant efforts to curb penny stock [fraud](../f/fraud.md). Companies trading under $5 per share face more stringent reporting and [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) requirements. The goal is to improve [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and reduce opportunities for [fraud](../f/fraud.md).

### The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)
FINRA, a private American [corporation](../c/corporation.md) that acts as a self-regulatory organization, has also put specific rules in place for the trading of [penny stocks](../p/penny_stocks.md), including the enforcement of stricter suitability standards.

### Broker-Dealer Requirements
Brokers are required to obtain a client's written agreement before executing transactions in [penny stocks](../p/penny_stocks.md) for the first time, and must also disclose the risks associated with [penny stocks](../p/penny_stocks.md) to the client. Additionally, brokers must disclose the current [quote](../q/quote.md) for the stock, as well as the compensation that the [firm](../f/firm.md) and the [broker](../b/broker.md) [will](../w/will.md) receive for the [trade](../t/trade.md).

## Trading Penny Stocks

### Due Diligence
Comprehensive research is crucial when it comes to [investing](../i/investing.md) in [penny stocks](../p/penny_stocks.md). Investors need to be diligent about understanding the company's [business](../b/business.md) model, management team, [financial health](../f/financial_health.md), and [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

### Analytical Tools
Several analytical tools can help traders navigate the risky waters of [penny stocks](../p/penny_stocks.md). [Technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md), which studies historical price and [volume patterns](../v/volume_patterns.md), can be particularly useful in identifying potential buy and sell points. Screens and filters to identify [stocks](../s/stock.md) with significant upward or downward [momentum](../m/momentum.md) can also be valuable.

### Trading Platforms
Various online brokers and trading platforms [offer](../o/offer.md) access to [penny stocks](../p/penny_stocks.md). Some popular platforms include [E*TRADE](../e/e_trade.md), [Charles Schwab](../c/charles_schwab.md), and TD [Ameritrade](../a/ameritrade.md). However, it is important to [note](../n/note.md) that not all brokers [will](../w/will.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) access to the OTC [market](../m/market.md).

### Strategies
Some of the popular strategies in penny stock trading involve [momentum trading](../m/momentum_trading.md), [scalping](../s/scalping.md), and utilizing short-term patterns to make quick profits. Given the high [volatility](../v/volatility.md), traders often rely on [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md) to minimize potential losses.

## Conclusion

[Investing](../i/investing.md) in [penny stocks](../p/penny_stocks.md) is not for the faint-hearted. While the potential for substantial gains exists, the risks are equally high. [Due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md) and thorough research are paramount for making informed decisions. Regulations have tightened to protect investors, but the [market](../m/market.md) inherently comes with high [risk](../r/risk.md) and [volatility](../v/volatility.md). For those willing to navigate these challenges, [penny stocks](../p/penny_stocks.md) can [offer](../o/offer.md) a thrilling, albeit risky, corner of the investment world.

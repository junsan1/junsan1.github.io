# Price Action Analysis

## Introduction
[Price action](../p/price_action.md) analysis is the study of price movement in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). Traders and analysts use [price action](../p/price_action.md) to intuitively interpret and forecast [market](../m/market.md) trends based on historical price movements, without relying on [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) or other external data. This approach is commonly employed in various markets including [stocks](../s/stock.md), forex, commodities, and more.

## Fundamentals of Price Action
[Price action](../p/price_action.md) refers to the movement of a [security](../s/security.md)’s price plotted over time. [Price action](../p/price_action.md) forms the [basis](../b/basis.md) for all [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) of a stock, [commodity](../c/commodity.md), or other [asset](../a/asset.md) chart. Many short-term traders rely on [price action](../p/price_action.md)-based techniques, often with combined use of [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) and charts, to inform their trading decisions.

## Components of Price Action
Several key elements make up [price action](../p/price_action.md) analysis, each of which provides valuable information about the [market](../m/market.md):

1. **[Candlestick Patterns](../c/candlestick_patterns.md)**: One of the most fundamental components, [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) charts display the high, low, [open](../o/open.md), and close prices of a [security](../s/security.md). Key patterns include [Doji](../d/doji.md), Hammer, Engulfing patterns, and more.

2. **[Support and Resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) Levels**: These are price levels at which a [security](../s/security.md) tends to find support as it falls and resistance as it rises. Identifying these levels helps in making trading decisions.

3. **[Trend](../t/trend.md) Lines**: Drawing [trend](../t/trend.md) lines helps in identifying the direction of the [market](../m/market.md). They connect significant price points on a chart, showing overall trends and potential points of [reversal](../r/reversal.md).

4. **[Volume](../v/volume.md)**: [Volume](../v/volume.md) indicates the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) or contracts traded in a [security](../s/security.md). Patterns in [volume](../v/volume.md) can confirm or deny price movements, providing further [trading signals](../t/trading_signals.md).

## Tools and Strategies in Price Action Trading
Different tools and strategies are employed by [price action](../p/price_action.md) traders to make informed trading decisions:

1. **[Chart Patterns](../c/chart_patterns.md)**: Patterns like Head and Shoulders, [Double Top](../d/double_top.md) and Bottom, and Triangles are used to predict future price movements.

2. **[Price Action](../p/price_action.md) Indicators**: While [price action trading](../p/price_action_trading.md) primarily avoids traditional indicators, some traders use them for confirmation, such as Moving Averages and the [Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (RSI).

3. **Breakouts and Fakeouts**: Traders watch for breakouts from [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels, and fakeouts (false breakouts) to identify potential trades.

4. **[Candlestick Patterns](../c/candlestick_patterns.md)**: Analysis of specific patterns like Bullish Engulfing, Bearish Harami, and [Morning Star](../m/morning_star.md) can provide signals for trading decisions.

## Benefits of Price Action Trading
1. **Simplicity**: [Price action trading](../p/price_action_trading.md) focuses on pure price movements, which can be simpler than using [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md).
2. **Versatility**: Applicable across different markets and timeframes.
3. **Reliability**: When mastered, [price action trading](../p/price_action_trading.md) can provide highly reliable [trading signals](../t/trading_signals.md).

## Limitations of Price Action Trading
1. **Subjectivity**: Interpretation can vary between traders.
2. **Experience-Dependent**: Requires substantial [market](../m/market.md) knowledge and experience.
3. **[Market](../m/market.md) Conditions**: Certain [market](../m/market.md) conditions may render [price action signals](../p/price_action_signals.md) less effective.

# Pay Yourself First

**Pay Yourself First (PYF)** is a financial strategy and [personal finance](../p/personal_finance_in_trading.md) philosophy that prioritizes saving and [investing](../i/investing.md) a portion of [income](../i/income.md) before paying for any other expenses. This concept is central to building financial [security](../s/security.md) and achieving long-term financial goals. By treating savings and investments as the foremost "bill" to be paid, individuals ensure that they consistently allocate resources towards their future financial well-being.

## History and Origin

The strategy of "Pay Yourself First" is widely attributed to the principles laid out in George S. Clason's 1926 classic, "The Richest Man in Babylon." The main philosophy in the book emphasizes the importance of allocating at least 10% of one's [earnings](../e/earnings.md) to savings or investments before anything else. Over the years, financial planners and advisors have adopted and promoted this strategy as a cornerstone for sound financial management.

## How Pay Yourself First Works

### Step-by-Step Guide

**1. Determine Your [Income](../i/income.md):**
   - Calculate your total monthly [income](../i/income.md) from all sources such as salary, freelance work, investments, and any other [revenue](../r/revenue.md) streams.

**2. Set a Savings Goal:**
   - Decide on a specific percentage or fixed amount of your [income](../i/income.md) to save before any other expenses are addressed. Common recommendations [range](../r/range.md) from 10% to 20%.

**3. Automate the Savings Process:**
   - Set up automatic transfers from your [checking account](../c/checking_account.md) to your savings or investment account. This ensures consistency and makes saving effortless.

**4. [Budget](../b/budget.md) with the Remaining Funds:**
   - After the pre-determined amount is allocated to savings, create a [budget](../b/budget.md) for the remaining funds to cover necessities such as rent, utilities, groceries, and discretionary expenses.

### Key Principles

- **Consistency:** Regularly saving a portion of [income](../i/income.md) is crucial for building significant savings over time.
- **Prioritization:** By making savings a [non-negotiable](../n/non-negotiable.md) priority, individuals reduce the likelihood of financial shortfalls.
- **Automation:** Automated transfers reduce the temptation to spend [money](../m/money.md) that should be saved and ensure a disciplined approach to financial management.

## Benefits of Pay Yourself First

### Financial Security

Paying yourself first helps create a financial cushion that can protect against unexpected expenses or emergencies. This [security](../s/security.md) reduces financial stress and provides peace of mind.

### Wealth Accumulation

By consistently saving and [investing](../i/investing.md), individuals benefit from the power of [compound interest](../c/compound_interest_in_trading.md), leading to substantial [wealth](../w/wealth.md) accumulation over time. The earlier one begins, the greater the potential returns.

### Goal Achievement

Paying yourself first aids in achieving specific financial goals, such as buying a [home](../h/home.md), funding education, or retiring comfortably. Setting aside funds for these goals ensures they are met systematically.

### Improved Financial Discipline

The practice encourages better financial habits by prioritizing saving over impulsive spending. It promotes budgeting and conscious financial decision-making.

## How Pay Yourself First Supports Financial Independence

Financial independence occurs when [passive income](../p/passive_income.md) from savings and investments exceeds living expenses. By prioritizing savings and investments, individuals accelerate their journey towards financial freedom. Here’s how PYF supports this goal:

- **[Emergency Fund](../e/emergency_fund.md) Creation:** A [robust](../r/robust.md) [emergency fund](../e/emergency_fund.md) can cover 3-6 months of living expenses, providing a safety net.
- **Retirement Savings:** Consistently saving for retirement through vehicles such as 401(k)s, IRAs, or other retirement accounts ensures a comfortable retirement.
- **Investment Growth:** [Investing](../i/investing.md) savings in [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), or other assets can generate [passive income](../p/passive_income.md) and [capital](../c/capital.md) growth.

## Common Methods of Paying Yourself First

### Savings Accounts

Regularly transferring a portion of [income](../i/income.md) into high-[yield](../y/yield.md) savings accounts ensures that funds grow with [interest](../i/interest.md). While returns are lower compared to other investment vehicles, the [principal](../p/principal.md) is relatively secure and [liquid](../l/liquid.md).

### Retirement Accounts 

Contributing to retirement accounts such as 401(k), IRA, or [Roth IRA](../r/roth_ira.md) takes advantage of tax benefits and employer matching contributions, maximizing the growth potential of retirement funds.

### Investment Accounts

[Investing](../i/investing.md) in [stocks](../s/stock.md), mutual funds, ETFs, or bonds can provide higher returns over the long term. A diversified portfolio minimizes [risk](../r/risk.md) while allowing the [money](../m/money.md) to grow.

## Tools and Resources

### Budgeting Apps

Budgeting apps such as Mint, YNAB (You Need A [Budget](../b/budget.md)), and Personal [Capital](../c/capital.md) help individuals track their spending, set saving goals, and monitor progress.

### Automated Savings Platforms

Platforms like Acorns and Chime allow for micro-savings by rounding up transactions and transferring the rounded-up amount to savings or investment accounts.

### Financial Advisors

Hiring a [financial advisor](../f/financial_advisor.md) to craft a tailored [financial plan](../f/financial_plan.md), including a PYF strategy, can provide personalized [guidance](../g/guidance.md) and accountability.

## Real-World Examples

### Case Study 1: Sarah’s Journey to Financial Freedom

Sarah earns $5,000 per month. By adhering to the PYF principle, she allocates 20% of her [income](../i/income.md), or $1,000, to savings and investments each month. Over the years, these contributions have compounded, allowing her to accumulate a significant [nest egg](../n/nest_egg.md). She has achieved her goal of a substantial [emergency fund](../e/emergency_fund.md) and is on track to a secure and early retirement.

### Case Study 2: John’s Path to Home Ownership

John wanted to buy a [home](../h/home.md) within five years. By paying himself first and saving 15% of his [income](../i/income.md) into a high-[yield](../y/yield.md) [savings account](../s/savings_account.md) and investments, he successfully amassed the [down payment](../d/down_payment.md) required. John's disciplined savings approach made his dream of homeownership a reality.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Income Variability

For those with variable incomes, such as freelancers or gig workers, maintaining consistent savings can be challenging. Implementing a flexible PYF approach by saving a percentage of [income](../i/income.md) rather than a fixed dollar amount can help address this [variability](../v/variability.md).

### Debt Obligations

High-[interest](../i/interest.md) [debt](../d/debt.md) can hinder the ability to save. Balancing [debt](../d/debt.md) [repayment](../r/repayment.md) with savings involves prioritizing high-[interest](../i/interest.md) [debt](../d/debt.md) while still allocating a portion of [income](../i/income.md) to savings to avoid financial backsliding.

## Conclusion

The strategy of "Pay Yourself First" is a powerful and straightforward financial habit that forms the foundation of long-term [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and [wealth](../w/wealth.md). By prioritizing savings and investments, individuals can secure their financial future, achieve significant financial milestones, and work towards financial independence. The consistent application of PYF creates disciplined financial behavior, nurturing both financial [security](../s/security.md) and growth.

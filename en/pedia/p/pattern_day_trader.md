# Pattern Day Trader

In the world of trading, there are various regulations and classifications designed to ensure that the markets operate fairly and to protect investors from undue risks. One such classification is the "Pattern [Day Trader](../d/day_trader.md)" (PDT). This term, which carries specific regulatory implications, applies to traders who engage in particular trading behaviors with specific frequency. Below, we delve into the details of what constitutes a pattern [day trader](../d/day_trader.md), the implications of this classification, regulatory requirements, and strategies to manage trading within these constraints.

## Definition of a Pattern Day Trader

A pattern [day trader](../d/day_trader.md) is an individual, often trading using a [margin account](../m/margin_account.md), who executes four or more "day trades" within five [business](../b/business.md) days, provided that the number of day trades represents more than six percent of their total trading activity during that period. A "day [trade](../t/trade.md)" is defined as the buying and selling of the same [security](../s/security.md) on the same day.

## Regulatory Implications

The Financial [Industry](../i/industry.md) Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) regulate pattern [day trading](../d/day_trading.md) to protect individual investors. These rules are outlined in FINRA Rule 4210. When an individual is classified as a pattern [day trader](../d/day_trader.md), they become subject to additional rules that do not apply to typical retail investors.

### Minimum Equity Requirement

One of the most significant rules is the minimum [equity](../e/equity.md) requirement. Once classified as a pattern [day trader](../d/day_trader.md), the account must maintain at least $25,000 in [equity](../e/equity.md) to continue [day trading](../d/day_trading.md). This [equity](../e/equity.md) can be in the form of cash or securities. Suppose an account falls below this threshold. In that case, the [trader](../t/trader.md) [will](../w/will.md) not be permitted to day [trade](../t/trade.md) until the account is brought back to the $25,000 minimum, which can limit the trading activities of smaller investors.

### Margin Accounts

Pattern day traders are required to [trade](../t/trade.md) within a [margin account](../m/margin_account.md). [Margin](../m/margin.md) accounts are brokerage accounts in which the [broker](../b/broker.md) lends the [customer](../c/customer.md) funds to purchase securities. The use of [margin](../m/margin.md) increases [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) and allows for leveraging but also comes with increased [risk](../r/risk.md).

## Implications for Traders

Given these regulations, traders classified as pattern day traders must carefully manage their [equity](../e/equity.md) and be mindful of the frequency of their trades. Failure to adhere to these requirements can result in disciplinary actions by brokers, including restrictions on trading activities, additional [margin](../m/margin.md) requirements, or even the account being frozen.

### Risk Management

Effective [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) becomes crucial for pattern day traders. This involves not merely the management of individual trades but also ensuring that they stay within regulatory parameters to avoid disruptions to their trading activities. For instance, traders need to monitor their account balances continuously to ensure they meet the $25,000 [equity](../e/equity.md) requirement.

### Psychological Implications

Being a pattern [day trader](../d/day_trader.md) means operating under a certain psychological pressure. Traders need to [handle](../h/handle.md) the stress of high-frequency trading and the additional challenge of maintaining regulatory compliance. Managing this mental aspect is equally important in ensuring that [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) are executed effectively and sustainably.

## Strategies for Pattern Day Traders

Pattern day traders often employ various strategies to maximize their returns. These strategies typically involve short-term price movements and can include:

### Scalping

[Scalping](../s/scalping.md) involves making rapid trades to exploit small price changes. This strategy requires close monitoring of the markets and quick decision-making, often utilizing high-frequency trading platforms.

### Momentum Trading

[Momentum trading](../m/momentum_trading.md) capitalizes on price trends. The [trader](../t/trader.md) identifies securities showing a strong directional movement and aims to [profit](../p/profit.md) from the continuation of this [trend](../t/trend.md). This strategy requires analyzing [volume](../v/volume.md) levels and price charts to identify potential explosive moves.

### Technical Analysis

[Technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) involves the use of historical price data and [volume](../v/volume.md) to make trading decisions. Pattern day traders often use charts, moving averages, and other indicators to predict future price movements and execute trades accordingly.

## Role of Technology

Technology plays a pivotal role in pattern [day trading](../d/day_trading.md). Advanced trading platforms that provide real-time data, charting tools, and fast [execution](../e/execution.md) are essential. Moreover, [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) systems and automated [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) are increasingly used by professional pattern day traders to [gain](../g/gain.md) an edge in the markets.

## Algo-Trading in Pattern Day Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), or algo-trading, involves the use of computer algorithms to automate trading decisions based on pre-defined criteria. For pattern day traders, algo-trading can provide several advantages:

### Speed and Efficiency

Algo-trading enables traders to execute large volumes of trades at speeds much faster than human capability. This is crucial in [day trading](../d/day_trading.md), where [market](../m/market.md) conditions can change rapidly.

### Removing Emotional Bias

By relying on algorithms, traders can eliminate emotional decision-making. This is particularly beneficial in the high-stakes environment of [day trading](../d/day_trading.md), where emotions can often lead to irrational choices.

### Backtesting Strategies

Algo-trading allows for [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) strategies using historical data. This means traders can validate their [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) before deploying them in live markets, thereby mitigating risks.

## Regulatory Considerations for Algo-Trading

While algo-trading offers many benefits, it also comes with additional regulatory requirements. For instance, traders must ensure their algorithms comply with [trading rules](../t/trading_rules.md) and regulations, including those specific to pattern [day trading](../d/day_trading.md). Additionally, firms [offering](../o/offering.md) algo-trading services may need to provide disclosures about how their algorithms operate and manage risks.

### Key Technologies in Algo-Trading

1. **[Execution](../e/execution.md) Management Systems (EMS):** These systems help traders execute orders quickly and efficiently.
2. **[Order Management Systems](../o/order_management_systems.md) (OMS):** OMS assist in managing and tracking orders, from [order](../o/order.md) creation through [execution](../e/execution.md).
3. **Data Analysis Tools:** These tools are essential for processing large volumes of real-time and historical data to inform [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md).

## Brokerages and Platforms for Pattern Day Traders

Choosing the right brokerage and [trading platform](../t/trading_platform.md) is critical for pattern day traders. The platform must [offer](../o/offer.md) low commissions, high-speed [execution](../e/execution.md), and [robust](../r/robust.md) [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) tools. Some popular platforms and brokerages include:

### Interactive Brokers

[Interactive Brokers](../i/interactive_brokers.md) is known for its professional-grade trading platforms and comprehensive tools for day traders. Their [website](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/) offers details on their trading solutions and regulatory compliance.

### TD Ameritrade

TD [Ameritrade](../a/ameritrade.md) provides platforms like thinkorswim, which is highly regarded for [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) and charting capabilities. Their [website](https://www.tdameritrade.com/) gives an overview of their services and tools.

### E*TRADE

[E*TRADE](../e/e_trade.md) offers a [range](../r/range.md) of trading tools suitable for pattern day traders, including comprehensive educational resources. More details can be found on their [website](https://us.etrade.com/).

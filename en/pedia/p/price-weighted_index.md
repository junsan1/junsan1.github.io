# Price-Weighted Index

A price-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) [index](../i/index.md) is a type of stock [market index](../m/market_index.md) in which each stock influences the [index](../i/index.md) in proportion to its price per share. Unlike other types of indexes, such as [market](../m/market.md)-[capitalization](../c/capitalization.md)-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) indexes, a price-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) [index](../i/index.md) computes the average of the prices of all the [stocks](../s/stock.md) included in it, and this average is then adjusted by a divisor to generate the [index](../i/index.md)'s [value](../v/value.md). This means that [stocks](../s/stock.md) with higher prices have a more significant impact on the [index](../i/index.md) movement than those with lower prices, regardless of the company's actual [market](../m/market.md) size.

## History and Examples

The concept of a price-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) [index](../i/index.md) dates back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries. One of the oldest and most well-known examples of a price-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) [index](../i/index.md) is the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), which was created by Charles Dow and Edward Jones in 1896. Initially, the DJIA included 12 industrial companies, and it aimed to provide a clear snapshot of the industrial sector's performance. Today, the DJIA comprises 30 blue-chip companies and is still one of the most widely followed indices in the world.

## Calculating a Price-Weighted Index

To calculate a price-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) [index](../i/index.md), follow these steps:

1. **List all the stock prices:** Gather the current price per share for each stock in the [index](../i/index.md).
2. **Sum the stock prices:** Add together the prices of all the [stocks](../s/stock.md).
3. **Determine the divisor:** The initial divisor is typically the number of [stocks](../s/stock.md) in the [index](../i/index.md). However, this divisor is adjusted for stock splits, dividends, and additions or deletions of [stocks](../s/stock.md) from the [index](../i/index.md) to ensure continuity.
4. **Calculate the [index](../i/index.md) [value](../v/value.md):** Divide the sum of the stock prices by the divisor to get the [index](../i/index.md) [value](../v/value.md).

### Example:

Suppose an [index](../i/index.md) consists of three [stocks](../s/stock.md) with the following prices: Stock A: $10, Stock B: $50, Stock C: $100.

1. Sum of stock prices: $10 + $50 + $100 = $160
2. Initial divisor: 3 (since there are three [stocks](../s/stock.md))
3. [Index](../i/index.md) [Value](../v/value.md): $160 / 3 ≈ 53.33

If Stock A undergoes a two-for-one split, its price [will](../w/will.md) reduce to $5. To ensure the [index](../i/index.md) remains consistent:

1. New Sum of stock prices: $5 + $50 + $100 = $155
2. New Divisor must be adjusted: 155 / 53.33 ≈ 2.91
3. Recalculated [Index](../i/index.md) [Value](../v/value.md) with new divisor: 155 / 2.91 ≈ 53.33

This adjustment ensures the historical performance of the [index](../i/index.md) remains continuous even after stock splits or other corporate actions.

## Characteristics and Implications

### Performance Dependency on Stock Prices

A significant characteristic of price-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) indices is that [stocks](../s/stock.md) with higher prices can disproportionately impact the [index](../i/index.md)'s performance, regardless of the companies' total [market value](../m/market_value.md). For example, if Stock X is trading at $500 while Stock Y is at $50, despite having significantly different [market](../m/market.md) capitalizations, Stock X [will](../w/will.md) have a ten times greater impact on the [index](../i/index.md)'s performance.

### Volatility

Due to the reliance on individual stock prices, a price-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) [index](../i/index.md) can exhibit heightened [volatility](../v/volatility.md) based on the price movements of high-priced [stocks](../s/stock.md). A substantial price fluctuation in a high-priced constituent can significantly sway the [index](../i/index.md), unlike in [market](../m/market.md)-cap-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) indexes where the impact would be moderated by the company's overall size.

### Frequency of Adjustments

Price-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) indices may require frequent adjustments. Changes due to stock splits, dividends, or changes in the list of constituent [stocks](../s/stock.md) necessitate recalculating the divisor to maintain consistent [index](../i/index.md) [value](../v/value.md). This can lead to a more complex maintenance routine compared to other [index](../i/index.md) types.

### Historical Context

The creation of price-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) indices like the DJIA made sense historically when technology and computational resources were limited. Adding and averaging stock prices was relatively straightforward for manual calculations. However, with the advent of advanced computing, more sophisticated methods such as [market](../m/market.md)-cap-weighting have become preferred for many newer indices due to their ability to more accurately reflect the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) economic variables.

## Comparing Price-Weighted and Market-Cap-Weighted Indices

### Definition

- **Price-[Weighted](../w/weighted.md) [Index](../i/index.md):** [Index](../i/index.md) [value](../v/value.md) derived from the price per share of its constituent [stocks](../s/stock.md). Each stock affects the [index](../i/index.md) proportionally to its price.
  
- **[Market](../m/market.md)-Cap-[Weighted](../w/weighted.md) [Index](../i/index.md):** [Index](../i/index.md) [value](../v/value.md) derived from the [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) of its constituent [stocks](../s/stock.md). Each stock affects the [index](../i/index.md) proportionally to its total [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) (price per share * number of [shares](../s/shares.md) outstanding).

### Example Indices

- **Price-[Weighted](../w/weighted.md):** Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)
- **[Market](../m/market.md)-Cap-[Weighted](../w/weighted.md):** S&P 500, [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md)-100

### Impact on Performance

- In a price-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) [index](../i/index.md), a high-priced but smaller-cap stock can have a more substantial effect than a lower-priced but larger-cap stock. Conversely, in a [market](../m/market.md)-cap-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) [index](../i/index.md), [large-cap stocks](../l/large_cap_stocks.md) dominate the [index](../i/index.md) performance, providing a more comprehensive reflection of the overall [market](../m/market.md)'s performance.
  
### Adjustments Required

- **Price-[Weighted](../w/weighted.md) Indices:** Frequent adjustments are required to the divisor to account for stock splits, dividends, and changes in stock listings.
- **[Market](../m/market.md)-Cap-[Weighted](../w/weighted.md) Indices:** Adjustments mainly involve changes in the constituent companies and do not require recalculating a divisor.

### Applicability

- **Price-[Weighted](../w/weighted.md) Indices:** More applicable for traditional, historical analyses and for indices with a smaller number of large, high-priced [stocks](../s/stock.md).
- **[Market](../m/market.md)-Cap-[Weighted](../w/weighted.md) Indices:** Preferred for broader [market](../m/market.md) representations and analytically intensive financial products like ETFs and mutual funds.

## Real-World Usage

### Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)

The DJIA is the iconic example of a price-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) [index](../i/index.md). Comprising 30 large publicly-traded companies, the [index](../i/index.md) is often seen as a barometer of the U.S. [economy](../e/economy.md). Companies within the DJIA are selected by the editors of The [Wall Street](../w/wall_street.md) [Journal](../j/journal.md) and represent a [range](../r/range.md) of sectors, except for transportation and utilities, which have their own specialized indices (e.g., Dow Jones Transportation Average).

### Nikkei 225

Another well-known price-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) [index](../i/index.md) is the [Nikkei](../n/nikkei.md) 225, which tracks the performance of 225 large, publicly owned companies in Japan. Established in 1950 by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun (The [Nikkei](../n/nikkei.md)), it is one of Asia's most widely recognized stock indices.

### Criticisms and Alternatives

Despite their historical significance, price-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) indices have faced criticisms:

1. **Disproportionate Influence:** [Stocks](../s/stock.md) with high prices can dominate [index](../i/index.md) movements, introducing bias.
2. **Not Reflective of Economic Reality:** They do not accurately reflect the economic size of companies because they ignore the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) outstanding.
3. **Frequent Adjustments:** Requires more frequent [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) and recalculation of the divisor.

Given these criticisms, many modern indices prefer [market](../m/market.md)-cap-weighting or other methodologies like equal-weighting or fundamentally-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) approaches.

### Financial Products

There are financial products like ETFs and mutual funds specifically designed to track price-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) indices. For instance, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (Ticker: DIA) aims to mirror the DJIA's performance, allowing investors to [gain](../g/gain.md) exposure to these 30 companies collectively.

## Conclusion

Price-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) indices, exemplified by the DJIA and [Nikkei](../n/nikkei.md) 225, [offer](../o/offer.md) unique perspectives on [market](../m/market.md) performance, heavily influenced by price fluctuations of high-priced [stocks](../s/stock.md). Despite their historical significance, they are gradually overshadowed by more representative methodologies like [market](../m/market.md)-cap-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) indices, which more accurately capture [market](../m/market.md) nuances by reflecting the total [economic value](../e/economic_value.md) of constituent companies. Nonetheless, understanding price-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) indices is fundamental for [finance](../f/finance.md) professionals, providing insights into traditional [market](../m/market.md) metrics and their evolution.

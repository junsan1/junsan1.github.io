# Preferred Stock

Preferred stock, also known as [preference shares](../p/preference_shares.md), is a type of [equity](../e/equity.md) [security](../s/security.md) that represents ownership in a [corporation](../c/corporation.md) having a higher claim on its assets and [earnings](../e/earnings.md) than [common stock](../c/common_stock.md). Preferred shareholders typically receive dividends before common shareholders and have a higher claim on assets in the event of [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md). This type of stock blends features of both [equity](../e/equity.md) and [debt](../d/debt.md).

### Characteristics of Preferred Stock

1. **[Dividend](../d/dividend.md) Priority:**
   Preferred shareholders are entitled to receive [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payments before any dividends are issued to common shareholders. These dividends are often fixed and paid at regular intervals.

2. **Fixed Dividends:**
   Dividends on preferred stock are typically set at a fixed rate, which means the payouts do not fluctuate with the company's [earnings](../e/earnings.md) as they might with [common stock](../c/common_stock.md).

3. **[Par Value](../p/par_value.md):**
   Preferred stock often has a [par value](../p/par_value.md), which is the [face value](../f/face_value.md) or the [nominal value](../n/nominal_value.md) of the share. The [dividend](../d/dividend.md) for preferred stock is typically a percentage of this [par value](../p/par_value.md).

4. **Cumulative vs Non-Cumulative:**
   - *Cumulative preferred stock* ensures that if a company does not pay dividends in one period, the unpaid dividends carry over to the next period and must be paid out before common shareholders receive dividends.
   - *Non-cumulative preferred stock* does not have this feature. If a company skips a [dividend](../d/dividend.md) [payment](../p/payment.md), these shareholders have no right to claim the forgone dividends in the future.

5. **[Convertible Preferred Stock](../c/convertible_preferred_stock.md):**
   These [shares](../s/shares.md) can be converted into a fixed number of common [shares](../s/shares.md), usually at the discretion of the [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md).

6. **Callable Preferred Stock:**
   Callable preferred [shares](../s/shares.md) can be bought back by the issuing [corporation](../c/corporation.md) at a predetermined price after a specified date.

7. **Voting Rights:**
   Preferred shareholders typically do not have voting rights, making this stock less attractive to investors who desire a say in [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md).

8. **[Liquidation Preference](../l/liquidation_preference.md):**
   In the event of [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md), preferred shareholders have a higher claim on the companyâ€™s assets than common shareholders but remain subordinate to bondholders.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

#### Advantages:

1. **[Income](../i/income.md) Stability:**
   The fixed [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payments provide a more stable [income](../i/income.md) stream than [common stock](../c/common_stock.md) dividends, which can be irregular.
   
2. **Higher Claim on Assets:**
   Preferred shareholders have a higher claim on the assets of a company during [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md), thus [offering](../o/offering.md) more [security](../s/security.md) compared to common shareholders.

3. **Conversion Features:**
   The option to convert [shares](../s/shares.md) into [common stock](../c/common_stock.md) provides the potential for [capital](../c/capital.md) appreciation in addition to the regular fixed dividends.

#### Disadvantages:

1. **Limited [Upside Potential](../u/upside_potential_in_trading.md):**
   Preferred [shares](../s/shares.md) do not benefit from the company's profitability as much as common [shares](../s/shares.md) do. If a company experiences significant growth, preferred shareholders may miss out on substantial [capital](../c/capital.md) gains.
   
2. **[Interest Rate Risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md):**
   Because dividends are often fixed, preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) are highly sensitive to [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) changes. If [interest](../i/interest.md) rates rise, the fixed [dividend](../d/dividend.md) becomes less attractive compared to new issues, leading to a drop in the stock's [value](../v/value.md).

3. **Lack of Voting Rights:**
   Preferred shareholders typically have no voting power, limiting their influence over corporate decisions.

### Types of Preferred Stock

Preferred stock can come in various types, each with unique features designed to meet the needs of different investors:

1. **Adjustable-Rate Preferred [Stocks](../s/stock.md) (ARPS):**
   These [shares](../s/shares.md) have dividends that adjust periodically based on an [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md), like the Treasury bill rate.

2. **[Participating Preferred Stock](../p/participating_preferred_stock.md):**
   In addition to receiving fixed dividends, shareholders may also receive extra dividends based on predetermined conditions, usually tied to the [firm](../f/firm.md)'s profits.

3. **Perpetual Preferred Stock:**
   These [shares](../s/shares.md) do not have a [maturity date](../m/maturity_date.md), meaning the dividends are paid indefinitely unless the [shares](../s/shares.md) are called away by the issuing company.

4. **Fixed-Rate Preferred Stock:**
   Dividends are set at a fixed rate and do not change over time.

### Trading Dynamics

Preferred stock, while less commonly traded than [common stock](../c/common_stock.md), finds its place on both organized exchanges and OTC markets. Institutional investors and individual [income](../i/income.md)-seeking investors frequently [trade](../t/trade.md) preferred [shares](../s/shares.md). The buying and selling dynamics differ notably from common [stocks](../s/stock.md) due to their fixed-[income](../i/income.md) characteristics and less speculative nature. 

### Use in Corporate Finance

Corporations [issue](../i/issue.md) preferred stock as a way to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) without diluting the voting power of common shareholders. This can be particularly appealing in strategic [financing](../f/financing.md) decisions. The [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) [will](../w/will.md) separately identify common and preferred stock under shareholders' [equity](../e/equity.md), acknowledging their distinct features and claims.

### Preferred Stock in Fintech

In the Fintech space, preferred stock plays a pivotal role in venture [financing](../f/financing.md). Fintech startups often [issue](../i/issue.md) preferred [shares](../s/shares.md) to [venture capital](../v/venture_capital.md) firms, granting them higher priority in [earnings](../e/earnings.md) and [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md) scenarios while preserving the founders' control via [common stock](../c/common_stock.md). Convertibility clauses in preferred stock allow early investors to convert their [shares](../s/shares.md) into common [shares](../s/shares.md) if the [startup](../s/startup.md) performs well, [offering](../o/offering.md) a symbiotic benefit of [security](../s/security.md) and growth potential.

### Real-World Examples

Preferred stock serves a diverse [range](../r/range.md) of objectives for both issuing companies and investors. It provides stability and priority for [income](../i/income.md)-focused investors and a flexible [capital](../c/capital.md)-raising tool for companies. Its unique blend of [debt](../d/debt.md) and [equity](../e/equity.md) characteristics allows it to fit neatly into various investment and [financing](../f/financing.md) strategies.

# Perpetual Bond

A perpetual [bond](../b/bond.md), also known as a "perpetual" or "consol [bond](../b/bond.md)," is a [fixed-income security](../f/fixed-income_security.md) with no [maturity date](../m/maturity_date.md). Issuers of these bonds are obligated to pay [interest](../i/interest.md) to bondholders indefinitely. As they have no [maturity](../m/maturity.md), [perpetual bonds](../p/perpetual_bonds.md) can be considered a kind of [equity](../e/equity.md). Despite their name, [perpetual bonds](../p/perpetual_bonds.md) can, in some cases, be callable, meaning the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) has the option to redeem them at a predetermined price after a specified period.

## Characteristics of Perpetual Bonds

### No Maturity Date
The defining feature of a perpetual [bond](../b/bond.md) is its lack of a [maturity date](../m/maturity_date.md). Unlike traditional bonds that have a defined period after which the [principal](../p/principal.md) is returned to the [bondholder](../b/bondholder.md), [perpetual bonds](../p/perpetual_bonds.md) do not have a set end date. They go on indefinitely, with the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) making [interest](../i/interest.md) payments perpetually.

### Interest Payments
[Interest](../i/interest.md) payments on [perpetual bonds](../p/perpetual_bonds.md), also known as coupon payments, are typically made on a regular [basis](../b/basis.md) (such as annually, semi-annually, or quarterly) and are usually fixed. The [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) can be higher compared to traditional bonds to compensate for the increased [risk](../r/risk.md) and indefinite investment period the [bondholder](../b/bondholder.md) is undertaking.

### Call Option
Many [perpetual bonds](../p/perpetual_bonds.md) come with a [call option](../c/call_option.md), which allows the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) to repay the [face value](../f/face_value.md) of the [bond](../b/bond.md) (and thus terminate the [interest](../i/interest.md) payments) after a certain period has elapsed. This can happen if the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) finds it advantageous to [refinance](../r/refinance.md) at a lower [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md).

### Subordinate Position in Capital Structure
[Perpetual bonds](../p/perpetual_bonds.md) often [hold](../h/hold.md) a subordinate position in the [issuer](../i/issuer.md)'s [capital structure](../c/capital_structure.md). This means that in the event of the [issuer](../i/issuer.md)'s [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md), perpetual bondholders are paid after other creditors but before [equity](../e/equity.md) shareholders.

## Advantages of Perpetual Bonds

### Higher Yield
One of the primary attractions of [perpetual bonds](../p/perpetual_bonds.md) is their higher [yield](../y/yield.md) compared to more traditional bonds. Investors are compensated for taking on the additional [risk](../r/risk.md) and the potential [perpetuity](../p/perpetuity.md) of the investment.

### Steady Income Stream
For [income](../i/income.md)-focused investors, [perpetual bonds](../p/perpetual_bonds.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) a steady and predictable [income](../i/income.md) stream in the form of regular [interest](../i/interest.md) payments. This can make them appealing to retirees and those looking for consistent [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md).

### Diversification
[Perpetual bonds](../p/perpetual_bonds.md) can [offer](../o/offer.md) [diversification benefits](../d/diversification_benefits.md) within an investment portfolio. By including fixed-[income](../i/income.md) securities with no [maturity date](../m/maturity_date.md), investors can spread out [risk](../r/risk.md) and potentially improve the [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted returns of their portfolio.

## Disadvantages of Perpetual Bonds

### Interest Rate Risk
Due to their indefinite [duration](../d/duration.md), [perpetual bonds](../p/perpetual_bonds.md) are highly sensitive to changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. If [interest](../i/interest.md) rates rise, the [value](../v/value.md) of the perpetual [bond](../b/bond.md) typically falls. Conversely, if [interest](../i/interest.md) rates fall, the [value](../v/value.md) of the [bond](../b/bond.md) rises. This makes them more volatile compared to traditional bonds.

### Inflation Risk
[Perpetual bonds](../p/perpetual_bonds.md) are subject to significant [inflation](../i/inflation.md) [risk](../r/risk.md). Since the [interest](../i/interest.md) payments are typically fixed, rising [inflation](../i/inflation.md) can erode the real [value](../v/value.md) of these payments over time. If [inflation](../i/inflation.md) increases significantly, the [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) of the fixed [interest](../i/interest.md) payments diminishes.

### Credit Risk
[Perpetual bonds](../p/perpetual_bonds.md) carry the [risk](../r/risk.md) of [issuer](../i/issuer.md) [default](../d/default.md). Since these bonds are often issued by financial institutions or corporations, their ability to make [interest](../i/interest.md) payments depends on their [financial health](../f/financial_health.md). If the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) faces financial difficulty, there is a [risk](../r/risk.md) that they may [default](../d/default.md) on the [bond](../b/bond.md).

### Call Risk
If the [bond](../b/bond.md) is callable, there is always the [risk](../r/risk.md) that the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) [will](../w/will.md) choose to redeem the [bond](../b/bond.md) when it is financially advantageous for them, potentially leaving the [bondholder](../b/bondholder.md) with a less attractive [reinvestment](../r/reinvestment.md) option.

## Examples of Perpetual Bond Issuances

### Banks and Financial Institutions
[Perpetual bonds](../p/perpetual_bonds.md) are often issued by banks and financial institutions as they count towards regulatory [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements. For example, major banks such as HSBC (https://www.hsbc.com) and JPMorgan Chase (https://www.jpmorganchase.com) have issued [perpetual bonds](../p/perpetual_bonds.md) to strengthen their [capital](../c/capital.md) base.

### Corporate Issuers
Large corporations may also [issue](../i/issue.md) [perpetual bonds](../p/perpetual_bonds.md) as a means of raising long-term [capital](../c/capital.md) without the obligation of repaying the [principal](../p/principal.md). An example can be found in companies like AT&T (https://www.att.com) which have utilized [perpetual bonds](../p/perpetual_bonds.md) for [capital](../c/capital.md) raising purposes.

## Valuation and Pricing

### Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model
The [valuation](../v/valuation.md) of a perpetual [bond](../b/bond.md) typically involves a Discounted [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md) (DCF) model. Since the [bond](../b/bond.md) pays a fixed [interest](../i/interest.md) [payment](../p/payment.md) indefinitely, the [value](../v/value.md) of the [bond](../b/bond.md) is the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of its [perpetuity](../p/perpetuity.md) of coupon payments. The formula for pricing a perpetual [bond](../b/bond.md) is:

\[ P = \frac{C}{r} \]

where:
- \( P \) = Price of the perpetual [bond](../b/bond.md)
- \( C \) = Annual coupon [payment](../p/payment.md)
- \( r \) = [Discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md) (or required [yield](../y/yield.md))

### Impact of Changes in Interest Rates
As mentioned earlier, [perpetual bonds](../p/perpetual_bonds.md) are highly sensitive to changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. When [interest](../i/interest.md) rates rise, the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of the fixed coupon payments declines, leading to a decrease in the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s price. Conversely, when [interest](../i/interest.md) rates fall, the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s price increases due to the higher [present value](../p/present_value.md) of future coupon payments.

## Regulatory and Accounting Treatment

### Regulatory Capital
For financial institutions, [perpetual bonds](../p/perpetual_bonds.md) can qualify as additional Tier 1 (AT1) or [Tier 2 capital](../t/tier_2_capital.md) under international banking regulations. This classification can help banks meet regulatory [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements and improve their [leverage ratios](../l/leverage_ratios.md).

### Accounting Implications
[Perpetual bonds](../p/perpetual_bonds.md) are recorded on the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) as [debt](../d/debt.md). The [interest](../i/interest.md) payments are treated as an [expense](../e/expense.md) on the [income statement](../i/income_statement.md), reducing the [issuer](../i/issuer.md)'s [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md). 

## Conclusion

[Perpetual bonds](../p/perpetual_bonds.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) unique characteristics and potential advantages for both issuers and investors. For issuers, these bonds provide a means of raising long-term [capital](../c/capital.md) without the obligation of repaying the [principal](../p/principal.md), while also counting towards regulatory [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements. For investors, [perpetual bonds](../p/perpetual_bonds.md) can [offer](../o/offer.md) higher yields and a steady [income](../i/income.md) stream.

However, it is crucial to consider the inherent risks associated with [perpetual bonds](../p/perpetual_bonds.md), including [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md), [inflation](../i/inflation.md) [risk](../r/risk.md), [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md), and call [risk](../r/risk.md). [Valuation](../v/valuation.md) of these bonds often requires careful analysis, particularly concerning changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and the [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) of the [issuer](../i/issuer.md).

Overall, [perpetual bonds](../p/perpetual_bonds.md) can play a valuable role in a diversified investment portfolio and serve as a strategic financial tool for issuers. Understanding their attributes and assessing associated risks can aid in making informed investment and [financing](../f/financing.md) decisions.

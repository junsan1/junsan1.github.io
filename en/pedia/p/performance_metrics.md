# Performance Metrics

In [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), the evaluation of investment strategies and the performance of [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) is critical for understanding their effectiveness and reliability. Performance metrics provide a way to measure, compare, and optimize [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). This comprehensive guide will delve into various performance metrics commonly used in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md).

## 1. Return Metrics

### 1.1 Absolute Return
Absolute return measures the total profit or loss generated by the trading strategy over a specific period. It is expressed as a percentage of the initial capital.

#### Formula:
\[ \text{Absolute Return} = \frac{\text{Ending Value} - \text{Beginning Value}}{\text{Beginning Value}} \times 100 \]

### 1.2 Annualized Return
Annualized return scales the absolute return to a one-year period, allowing for comparison between strategies with different durations.

#### Formula:
\[ \text{Annualized Return} = \left(1 + \text{Absolute Return}\right)^{\frac{1}{\text{Number of Years}}} - 1 \]

## 2. Risk Metrics

### 2.1 Volatility
Volatility represents the degree of variation in the asset’s price, typically measured using the standard deviation of returns.

#### Formula:
\[ \text{Volatility} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (R_i - \bar{R})^2} \]
Where \( R_i \) is the return in period \( i \), \( \bar{R} \) is the average return, and \( N \) is the number of periods.

### 2.2 Drawdown
Drawdown measures the peak-to-trough decline, representing the largest percentage drop from a peak to a subsequent trough before a new peak is attained.

#### Formula:
\[ \text{Drawdown} = \frac{\text{Peak Value} - \text{Trough Value}}{\text{Peak Value}} \]

### 2.3 Maximum Drawdown
Maximum Drawdown is the largest observed drawdown over a period, indicating the greatest potential loss.

## 3. Risk-Adjusted Return Metrics

### 3.1 Sharpe Ratio
The [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) adjusts the return of an investment for its risk by subtracting the risk-free rate from the investment return and dividing by its standard deviation.

#### Formula:
\[ \text{[Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md)} = \frac{\bar{R} - R_f}{\sigma_R} \]
Where \( \bar{R} \) is the average return, \( R_f \) is the risk-free rate, and \( \sigma_R \) is the standard deviation of returns.

### 3.2 Sortino Ratio
The [Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md) is a variation of the [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) that only considers downside risk by using the standard deviation of negative returns.

#### Formula:
\[ \text{[Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md)} = \frac{\bar{R} - R_f}{\sigma_D} \]
Where \( \sigma_D \) is the [downside deviation](../d/downside_deviation.md).

### 3.3 Information Ratio
The [Information Ratio](../i/information_ratio.md) evaluates the performance of an investment relative to a benchmark, adjusting for risk.

#### Formula:
\[ \text{[Information Ratio](../i/information_ratio.md)} = \frac{\bar{R} - \bar{R}_B}{\sigma_{\alpha}} \]
Where \( \bar{R}_B \) is the benchmark return, and \( \sigma_{\alpha} \) is the tracking error (standard deviation of the excess returns).

## 4. Regression-Based Metrics

### 4.1 Alpha
Alpha measures the [active return](../a/active_return.md) of an investment strategy relative to the market. A positive alpha indicates outperformance.

#### Formula:
\[ \alpha = R - (R_f + \beta (R_M - R_f)) \]
Where \( R \) is the strategy return, \( R_M \) is the market return, and \( \beta \) is the beta of the investment.

### 4.2 Beta
Beta measures the sensitivity of an investment’s returns relative to the market.

#### Formula:
\[ \beta = \frac{\text{Cov}(R_i, R_M)}{\text{Var}(R_M)} \]
Where \( \text{Cov}(R_i, R_M) \) is the covariance between the strategy return and the market return, and \( \text{Var}(R_M) \) is the variance of the market return.

### 4.3 R-Squared
R-Squared indicates the proportion of variance for a dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable or variables in a regression model.

#### Formula:
\[ R^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{\sum (y_i - \bar{y})^2} \]
Where \( y_i \) are the observed values, \( \hat{y}_i \) are the predicted values, and \( \bar{y} \) is the mean of observed values.

## 5. Other Important Metrics

### 5.1 Calmar Ratio
The Calmar Ratio measures the return of an investment relative to its maximum drawdown, providing a risk-adjusted measure of performance.

#### Formula:
\[ \text{Calmar Ratio} = \frac{\text{Annual Return}}{\text{Maximum Drawdown}} \]

### 5.2 Prospective Metrics
Several metrics provide forward-looking measures, such as Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES), estimating potential future risks.

#### 5.2.1 Value at Risk (VaR)
Value at Risk quantifies the potential loss in value of a portfolio over a defined period for a given confidence interval.

#### Formula:
\[ \text{VaR} = VM(1 - \text{confidence level}) \times \sqrt{T} \times \sigma \]

#### 5.2.2 Expected Shortfall (ES)
Expected Shortfall, also known as Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), measures the average loss in value of a portfolio given that the Value at Risk threshold has been breached.

#### Formula:
\[ \text{ES} = -\frac{1}{\alpha} \int_{0}^{\alpha} VaR_{u} du \]

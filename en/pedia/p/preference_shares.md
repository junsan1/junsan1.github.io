# Preference Shares

## Introduction

Preference [shares](../s/shares.md), also known as [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md), are a class of ownership in a [corporation](../c/corporation.md) that has a higher claim on its assets and [earnings](../e/earnings.md) than [common stock](../c/common_stock.md). Preferred [shares](../s/shares.md) typically come with dividends that must be paid out before dividends to common shareholders and usually do not have voting rights. They are a hybrid form of [financing](../f/financing.md), [offering](../o/offering.md) a mix of the characteristics of [equity](../e/equity.md) and [debt](../d/debt.md), making them a distinct choice for both the issuing company and the [investor](../i/investor.md).

## Characteristics of Preference Shares

### Dividend Priority

Preference shareholders receive [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payments before common shareholders. These dividends are often fixed and may accumulate if not paid when due, a feature known as cumulative [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md). This priority in dividends makes preferred [shares](../s/shares.md) an attractive investment for those seeking a steady [income](../i/income.md) stream. 

### Fixed Dividend Rate

Most preference [shares](../s/shares.md) deliver a fixed [dividend rate](../d/dividend_rate.md), similar to the fixed [interest](../i/interest.md) on bonds. This rate is typically stated when the [shares](../s/shares.md) are issued, and it doesn't change. The fixed nature of these dividends provides a predictable [income](../i/income.md) for investors.

### Capital Repayment Priority

In the event of [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md) or [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md), preference shareholders have a higher claim on the assets of the company than common shareholders. This partially offsets the [risk](../r/risk.md) of [investing](../i/investing.md) in [equity](../e/equity.md), providing a cushion against potential losses.

### Convertibility

Some preference [shares](../s/shares.md) come with the option to be converted into a fixed number of common [shares](../s/shares.md), either at the option of the [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) or automatically at a specific time. These convertible preferred [shares](../s/shares.md) give investors the potential to benefit from the [upside](../u/upside.md) movement of the company’s [common stock](../c/common_stock.md).

### Non-Voting Rights

Generally, preference shareholders do not have voting rights in the company's AGM (Annual General Meeting). However, if dividends have been in arrears for some time, these shareholders might attain temporary voting rights until their dividends are brought back to par with the cumulative arrears.

### Callable Feature

Callable preferred [shares](../s/shares.md) give the issuing [corporation](../c/corporation.md) the right to repurchase the [shares](../s/shares.md) at a specified price after a certain date. This feature allows the company flexibility to [refinance](../r/refinance.md) if conditions are more favorable or if they choose to retire the [shares](../s/shares.md).

## Types of Preference Shares

### Cumulative Preference Shares

These [shares](../s/shares.md) come with the benefit of accumulating dividends. If the issuing company skips a [dividend](../d/dividend.md) [payment](../p/payment.md), it must pay it in the future alongside regular dividends before any can be distributed to common shareholders.

### Non-Cumulative Preference Shares

Non-cumulative preference [shares](../s/shares.md) do not accumulate unpaid dividends. If a [dividend](../d/dividend.md) is skipped, the [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) does not have the right to claim it in the future. 

### Participating Preference Shares

Participating preferred shareholders have the right to receive dividends equal to the amount that holders of common [shares](../s/shares.md) receive, in addition to the fixed preferential [dividend](../d/dividend.md). They also share in the [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of [surplus](../s/surplus.md) assets during [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md), after all debts and other claims are settled.

### Convertible Preference Shares

These [shares](../s/shares.md) allow investors to convert their preference [shares](../s/shares.md) into a predetermined number of common [shares](../s/shares.md), usually at the discretion of the [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md).

### Perpetual Preference Shares

These [shares](../s/shares.md) have no fixed [redemption](../r/redemption.md) date. They require the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) to pay dividends indefinitely, or until they decide to call (repurchase) them, if the [shares](../s/shares.md) are callable.

## Benefits of Preference Shares

### Income Stability

The fixed [dividend](../d/dividend.md) feature provides a stable and predictable [income](../i/income.md) stream, which is especially appealing to retirees and [income](../i/income.md)-focused investors.

### Priority in Dividends and Liquidation

Preference shareholders enjoy prioritization in [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payments and [asset](../a/asset.md) [distribution](../d/distribution.md) during [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md), reducing their [downside risk](../d/downside_risk.md) compared to common shareholders.

### Tax Advantages

In some jurisdictions, dividends received from preference [shares](../s/shares.md) may be taxed at a lower rate than other forms of [income](../i/income.md), making them an attractive investment from a tax perspective.

### Diversification

Preference [shares](../s/shares.md) can [offer](../o/offer.md) a [diversification](../d/diversification.md) benefit to investors, as they provide exposure to [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md) mechanisms that differ from common [equity](../e/equity.md) and bonds.

## Drawbacks of Preference Shares

### Limited Upside Potential

The fixed [dividend rate](../d/dividend_rate.md) limits the potential for [capital](../c/capital.md) appreciation seen with common [shares](../s/shares.md). 

### Interest Rate Sensitivity

Like bonds, the [value](../v/value.md) of preferred [shares](../s/shares.md) can be negatively affected by rising [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. As rates rise, newer issues may [offer](../o/offer.md) higher dividends, making existing lower-[yield](../y/yield.md) [shares](../s/shares.md) less attractive.

### Missed Voting Rights

The lack of voting rights can be a significant drawback for investors looking to have a say in the company's strategic decisions.

### Credit Risk

While preferred [shares](../s/shares.md) are generally safer than common [shares](../s/shares.md), they still face [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md). The issuing company may encounter financial difficulties that affect its ability to pay dividends.

## Preference Shares vs. Common Shares

Understanding the key differences between preference [shares](../s/shares.md) and common [shares](../s/shares.md) is crucial for making an informed investment decision.

### Dividends

- **Preference [Shares](../s/shares.md)**: Have a fixed [dividend rate](../d/dividend_rate.md), higher priority in [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payments.
- **Common [Shares](../s/shares.md)**: Dividends vary and are paid after preference shareholders.

### Voting Rights

- **Preference [Shares](../s/shares.md)**: Generally no voting rights.
- **Common [Shares](../s/shares.md)**: Have voting rights, allowing shareholders to influence management decisions.

### Risk and Capital Appreciation

- **Preference [Shares](../s/shares.md)**: Lower [risk](../r/risk.md) due to fixed dividends and priority in [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md) but limited potential for [capital](../c/capital.md) appreciation.
- **Common [Shares](../s/shares.md)**: Higher [risk](../r/risk.md) with no fixed [dividend](../d/dividend.md) but greater potential for [capital](../c/capital.md) appreciation.

## Issuance of Preference Shares

### Corporate Reasons for Issuing

Corporations [issue](../i/issue.md) preference [shares](../s/shares.md) for a variety of strategic reasons:

1. **Raising [Capital](../c/capital.md) without Diluting Control**: Preference [shares](../s/shares.md) can provide significant [capital](../c/capital.md) influx without diluting the control of existing common shareholders. This is especially appealing for company founders or family-owned businesses.

2. **Financial Structuring**: Preference [shares](../s/shares.md) can be used to optimize a [corporation](../c/corporation.md)’s [capital structure](../c/capital_structure.md). By having a blend of [debt](../d/debt.md), common [equity](../e/equity.md), and preferred [equity](../e/equity.md), companies might achieve a more advantageous [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md) and [risk](../r/risk.md) profile.

3. **Flexibility**: Issuing callable preference [shares](../s/shares.md) provides companies with the flexibility to manage their [capital structure](../c/capital_structure.md). They can repurchase [shares](../s/shares.md) if they have excess cash or if [interest](../i/interest.md) rates decline, making [debt](../d/debt.md) cheaper than [equity](../e/equity.md).

### Steps in Issuance

1. **Board Approval**: The proposal to [issue](../i/issue.md) preference [shares](../s/shares.md) must first be approved by the board of directors.

2. **[Shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) Approval**: Depending on the jurisdiction, issuing preference [shares](../s/shares.md) may require a vote by existing shareholders.

3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Comply with securities regulation and other legal requirements which may include filing with the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) or other local regulatory bodies.

4. **Setting Terms**: Determining the specifics, such as [dividend](../d/dividend.md) rates, call provisions, convertibility [options](../o/options.md), and whether the [shares](../s/shares.md) [will](../w/will.md) be participating or non-participating.

5. **[Marketing](../m/marketing.md) and [Sale](../s/sale.md)**: The [shares](../s/shares.md) are then marketed to potential investors through channels such as [investment banks](../i/investment_bank_(ib).md) or brokers.

## Preference Shares in Financial Markets

### Exchange-Traded Preferred Shares

Many preference [shares](../s/shares.md) are traded on major exchanges like the New York Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (NYSE) or [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md). This trading provides [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) to investors who can buy or sell these [shares](../s/shares.md) just like [common stock](../c/common_stock.md).

### Credit Ratings

[Credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) agencies such as Moody's, S&P, and Fitch rate preference [shares](../s/shares.md), providing an assessment of the issuing company’s [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md). Higher-rated issues are generally considered safer and thus [offer](../o/offer.md) lower [dividend](../d/dividend.md) yields.

### Investment Options

Institutions may [offer](../o/offer.md) funds or ETFs that focus on preferred [shares](../s/shares.md), providing a convenient method for individual investors to [gain](../g/gain.md) broad exposure without having to select specific preferred [shares](../s/shares.md).

## Regulatory and Tax Considerations

### Regulatory Framework

The issuance and trading of preference [shares](../s/shares.md) are regulated by securities laws to protect investors and maintain fair markets. Companies must comply with ongoing [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) requirements, including quarterly and annual [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md).

### Tax Treatments

In many jurisdictions, dividends from preference [shares](../s/shares.md) have unique tax treatments:

- **Corporate Investors**: In some regions, dividends received by corporations are subject to a lower [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md) expressed as the Dividends-Received [Deduction](../d/deduction.md) (DRD).
- **Individual Investors**: May benefit from preferential tax rates on qualified dividends, though specific regulations vary by country.

Understanding the tax implications is vital for investors, affecting the net [yield](../y/yield.md) and investment attractiveness of preference [shares](../s/shares.md).

## Conclusion

Preference [shares](../s/shares.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) a unique blend of characteristics, providing steady dividends with a higher claim on assets than common [shares](../s/shares.md). They are valuable tools in [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md) for raising [capital](../c/capital.md) and optimizing [financial structure](../f/financial_structure.md) while [offering](../o/offering.md) investors an [income](../i/income.md)-producing alternative to bonds. However, they come with limitations, including capped [upside potential](../u/upside_potential_in_trading.md) and lack of voting rights. Understanding the detailed features, benefits, drawbacks, and regulatory landscape of preference [shares](../s/shares.md) can help both investors and corporations make informed decisions.

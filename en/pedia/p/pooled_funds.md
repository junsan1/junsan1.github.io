# Pooled Funds

Pooled funds are investment vehicles that aggregate [capital](../c/capital.md) from [multiple](../m/multiple.md) investors to collectively purchase securities. By pooling their resources, individual investors can access a diversified portfolio of assets, benefiting from [economies of scale](../e/economies_of_scale.md), professional management, and improved [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md). Pooled funds come in various forms, including mutual funds, [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds, [exchange](../e/exchange.md)-traded funds (ETFs), and [private equity](../p/private_equity.md) funds. Each type has distinct characteristics, [risk profiles](../r/risk_profiles.md), and investment strategies, catering to different [investor](../i/investor.md) needs and objectives.

## Types of Pooled Funds

### 1. Mutual Funds

Mutual funds are one of the most widely known and accessible types of pooled funds. They pool [money](../m/money.md) from numerous investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, or other securities.

#### Characteristics:
- **[Open](../o/open.md)-end Funds**: Most mutual funds are [open](../o/open.md)-end, meaning investors can buy or redeem [shares](../s/shares.md) at the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s net [asset](../a/asset.md) [value](../v/value.md) (NAV) at the end of each trading day.
- **Professional Management**: Managed by professional portfolio managers who make investment decisions based on the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s objectives.

- **Lower Costs**: Generally have lower [expense](../e/expense.md) ratios compared to mutual funds.

## Advantages of Pooled Funds

### 1. Diversification

- **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Mitigation**: Spreading investments across various assets reduces the impact of any single [security](../s/security.md)'s poor performance.

### 4. Liquidity

- **Ease of Entry and Exit**: Investors can easily enter and exit positions, especially with mutual funds and ETFs.

## Regulatory Environment

Different types of pooled funds are subject to varying levels of regulation. For instance, mutual funds are highly regulated in jurisdictions like the United States, where the SEC imposes stringent requirements on [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md), reporting, and fairness. ETFs also fall under regulatory oversight, ensuring a high level of [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and [investor](../i/investor.md) protection. [Hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds and [private equity](../p/private_equity.md) funds, on the other hand, often face less stringent regulatory demands, but they are generally restricted to sophisticated or accredited investors who can bear the potential risks.

Pooled funds [offer](../o/offer.md) a compelling way for investors to [gain](../g/gain.md) [diversification](../d/diversification.md), professional management, and potential cost savings. While they come with certain disadvantages and risks, the benefits often outweigh these drawbacks for many investors, especially those seeking broad [market exposure](../m/market_exposure.md) and professional investment oversight.

# Pump-and-Dump Scheme

A pump-and-dump scheme is a type of securities [fraud](../f/fraud.md) that involves artificially inflating the price of a stock or other [security](../s/security.md) in [order](../o/order.md) to sell it at a higher price. This fraudulent practice is common in [penny stocks](../p/penny_stocks.md), which are small company [stocks](../s/stock.md) that [trade](../t/trade.md) at a low price and typically outside of major [market](../m/market.md) exchanges. The scheme relies heavily on misleading information, aggressive promotion, and often [social media](../s/social_media.md) manipulation to lure investors.

### Mechanism of Pump-and-Dump Scheme

##### 1. **Accumulation Phase (Pump)**

During this phase, fraudsters accumulate large amounts of a low-priced stock, one that trades thinly and, thus, is easily manipulated. Concurrently, they create a buzz around this stock by disseminating false or exaggerated information about the company. They often use methods like:

- **Press Releases:** Issuing fake or exaggerated press releases that announce purportedly exciting news about the company.
- **[Social Media](../s/social_media.md) Campaigns:** Utilizing Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, and other platforms to spread rumors and create hype. The rise of platforms like Telegram and Discord has provided new venues for coordinated efforts.
- **Email Newsletters and Message Boards:** Sending out newsletters and leveraging online forums to promote the stock.

##### 2. **Distribution Phase (Dump)**

Once the stock's price has been artificially inflated, the scammers then start selling off their [shares](../s/shares.md) at these elevated prices. This sudden increase in sell orders causes the stock price to plummet, leading to substantial losses for those late investors who bought in at the peak price.

### Legal Implications

Pump-and-dump schemes are illegal under securities law in many jurisdictions, including the United States. Agencies such as the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) rigorously pursue perpetrators of such schemes. Penalties can [range](../r/range.md) from hefty fines to imprisonment and civil suits.

### Historical Examples

One of the most infamous examples of a pump-and-dump scheme involved notable events such as:

- **Stratton Oakmont:** The brokerage [firm](../f/firm.md) led by Jordan Belfort (the "Wolf of [Wall Street](../w/wall_street.md)") was involved in several pump-and-dump schemes, manipulating [penny stocks](../p/penny_stocks.md) and defrauding investors out of millions.

### Preventative Measures

To avoid falling victim to such schemes, investors should take the following precautions:

1. **[Due Diligence](../d/due_diligence.md):** Always research the company and understand what it does, who manages it, and how it makes [money](../m/money.md).
2. **Regulatory Filings:** [Check](../c/check.md) regulatory filings like the 10-K and 10-Q reports on the SECâ€™s EDGAR database.
3. **Skepticism of Superlatives:** Be wary of [stocks](../s/stock.md) being promoted as "must-buy" or "unstoppable."
4. **[Volume](../v/volume.md) and Price Spikes:** Sudden, unexplained increases in trading volumes or stock prices often are red flags.

### Technological Impact

The rise of [social media](../s/social_media.md) and online trading platforms has democratized access to [investing](../i/investing.md) and information, but it has also created fertile ground for [fraud](../f/fraud.md). For instance:

- **Robotic [Trading Algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md):** Fraudsters have developed sophisticated algorithms to exploit trading inconsistencies or [retail investor](../r/retail_investor.md) behaviors.
- **Bot Accounts:** Automated accounts can be used en masse to simulate widespread enthusiasm for the stock, misleading actual investors.

### Case Study: Cryptocurrency Pump-and-Dump

Cryptocurrencies, due to their largely unregulated nature, have become a new frontier for pump-and-dump schemes. Specifics could include:

- **Telegram Groups:** Coordinated groups on messaging platforms plan to collectively buy and sell specific coins.
- **ICO Manipulations:** Fraudsters promote initial coin offerings (ICOs) with exaggerated claims to inflate the [value](../v/value.md) of a new cryptocurrency.

### Detection and Intervention

Financial regulators and exchanges are increasingly using sophisticated surveillance and machine-[learning algorithms](../l/learning_algorithms_in_trading.md) to detect pump-and-dump activities in real-time. Methods include:

- **[Pattern Recognition](../p/pattern_recognition.md):** Identifying trading patterns indicative of pump-and-dump schemes.
- **[Network Analysis](../n/network_analysis_in_trading.md):** Analyzing social network connections to identify coordinated promotional efforts.

### How to Report

If you suspect a pump-and-dump scheme, you can file a report with:

- **Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC)**: [SEC Complaint Form](https://www.sec.gov/oiea/Complaint.html)
- **Financial [Industry](../i/industry.md) Regulatory Authority (FINRA)**: [FINRA Complaints](https://www.finra.org/investors/have-problem/file-complaint)
- **[Commodity Futures](../c/commodity_futures.md) Trading [Commission](../c/commission.md) (CFTC)**: [CFTC Fraud Advisories](https://www.cftc.gov/ConsumerProtection/FraudAwarenessPrevention/index.htm)

### Conclusion

Pump-and-dump schemes are an enduring menace to [market](../m/market.md) integrity, leveraging human psychology and modern technology to perpetrate [fraud](../f/fraud.md). While regulatory bodies and technology are continuously evolving to combat these schemes, [investor](../i/investor.md) education and vigilance remain the first line of defense.

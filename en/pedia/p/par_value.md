# Par Value

Par [value](../v/value.md), also known as "[nominal value](../n/nominal_value.md)" or "[face value](../f/face_value.md)," is a term extensively used in [finance](../f/finance.md) and trading, particularly in the context of bonds and [stocks](../s/stock.md). It represents the amount at which a [security](../s/security.md) is issued or can be redeemed at [maturity](../m/maturity.md). 

## Par Value in Bonds

In the [bond market](../b/bond_market.md), par [value](../v/value.md) is the [face value](../f/face_value.md) of a [bond](../b/bond.md), which the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) agrees to pay the [bondholder](../b/bondholder.md) at [maturity](../m/maturity.md). Typically, bonds are issued in denominations of $1,000, known as their par [value](../v/value.md). For example, if an [investor](../i/investor.md) buys a [bond](../b/bond.md) with a par [value](../v/value.md) of $1,000, they should expect to receive this amount back at the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s [maturity date](../m/maturity_date.md).

### Importance of Par Value in Bonds

1. **Coupon Payments**: [Bond](../b/bond.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) payments, known as coupon payments, are generally calculated as a percentage of the [bond](../b/bond.md)’s par [value](../v/value.md). For instance, a [bond](../b/bond.md) with a par [value](../v/value.md) of $1,000 and a [coupon rate](../c/coupon_rate.md) of 5% [will](../w/will.md) pay $50 annually.

2. **Pricing**: The [bond](../b/bond.md)'s [market price](../m/market_price.md) can fluctuate based on [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, [credit](../c/credit.md) quality of the [issuer](../i/issuer.md), and remaining time to [maturity](../m/maturity.md). However, at [maturity](../m/maturity.md), the [bond](../b/bond.md) [will](../w/will.md) be redeemed at its par [value](../v/value.md), assuming the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) does not [default](../d/default.md).

3. **[Yield](../y/yield.md) Calculation**: [Bond](../b/bond.md) yields, such as [current yield](../c/current_yield.md) and [yield to maturity](../y/yield_to_maturity.md) (YTM), use par [value](../v/value.md) as a crucial component in their calculations. For example, the [current yield](../c/current_yield.md) is derived from dividing the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s annual coupon [payment](../p/payment.md) by its current price but par [value](../v/value.md) comes into play in the overall [yield to maturity](../y/yield_to_maturity.md) calculation.

### Bond Premiums and Discounts

Bonds can [trade](../t/trade.md) above ([premium](../p/premium.md)) or below ([discount](../d/discount.md)) their par [value](../v/value.md) based on prevailing [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and other factors affecting [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md). 

- **[Premium](../p/premium.md) Bonds**: If prevailing [interest](../i/interest.md) rates are lower than the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s [coupon rate](../c/coupon_rate.md), the [bond](../b/bond.md) [will](../w/will.md) be more valuable and [trade](../t/trade.md) above par [value](../v/value.md).
- **[Discount](../d/discount.md) Bonds**: Conversely, if prevailing [interest](../i/interest.md) rates are higher, the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s fixed coupon payments become less attractive, leading the [bond](../b/bond.md) to [trade](../t/trade.md) below par [value](../v/value.md).

### Example

Assume an [investor](../i/investor.md) buys a [bond](../b/bond.md) with a par [value](../v/value.md) of $1,000 and a 5% [coupon rate](../c/coupon_rate.md). If after purchasing the [bond](../b/bond.md), [market](../m/market.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) rates rise to 6%, the [bond](../b/bond.md)’s price [will](../w/will.md) drop below its par [value](../v/value.md) because its fixed [interest](../i/interest.md) payments are less attractive compared to new issuances. Conversely, if rates drop to 4%, the [bond](../b/bond.md) [will](../w/will.md) [trade](../t/trade.md) above par [value](../v/value.md) as its coupon payments are more attractive.

## Par Value in Stocks

In equities, par [value](../v/value.md) is a [nominal](../n/nominal.md) dollar amount assigned to [shares](../s/shares.md) of stock. This [value](../v/value.md) is often very low and serves more as an [accounting](../a/accounting.md) measure rather than a real [market](../m/market.md) measure. For instance, a [corporation](../c/corporation.md) might [issue](../i/issue.md) [shares](../s/shares.md) with a par [value](../v/value.md) of $0.01.

### Importance and Function

1. **Legal Minimum [Capital](../c/capital.md)**: Par [value](../v/value.md) can represent the minimum amount of [capital](../c/capital.md) that must be retained within the company and cannot be paid out as dividends.

2. **[Accounting](../a/accounting.md) Entry**: Par [value](../v/value.md) helps in creating the entry for [common stock](../c/common_stock.md) in the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md). The difference between the [issue](../i/issue.md) price and the par [value](../v/value.md) is typically credited to "[Additional Paid-In Capital](../a/additional_paid-in_capital.md)".

3. **Historical Significance**: Historically, par [value](../v/value.md) helped protect shareholders by establishing a base price for stock issuances. However, it has largely become a formality and holds little functional importance in modern markets due to the widespread practice of issuing [stocks](../s/stock.md) at no-par [value](../v/value.md) or very low par [value](../v/value.md).

### Example

If a [corporation](../c/corporation.md) issues 1,000 [shares](../s/shares.md) at a par [value](../v/value.md) of $0.01 per share, the [common stock](../c/common_stock.md) line in the shareholders’ [equity](../e/equity.md) section on the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) would show $10 (1,000 [shares](../s/shares.md) * $0.01 par [value](../v/value.md)). Any amount above par [value](../v/value.md) raised through the [sale](../s/sale.md) of [shares](../s/shares.md) would be recorded in the [Additional Paid-In Capital](../a/additional_paid-in_capital.md) account.

## No-Par Value Stock

In some jurisdictions, companies may [issue](../i/issue.md) no-par [stocks](../s/stock.md), which do not have a specified [face value](../f/face_value.md). This practice provides greater flexibility for the company in issuing [shares](../s/shares.md) at varying prices without altering the [nominal value](../n/nominal_value.md).

### Example

Assume a company issues 1,000 [shares](../s/shares.md) at $10 each with no par [value](../v/value.md). The entire $10,000 raised would be attributed directly to the [common stock](../c/common_stock.md) account under shareholders’ [equity](../e/equity.md).

## Conclusion

Par [value](../v/value.md) plays different roles in the context of bonds and [stocks](../s/stock.md). For bonds, it is a critical measure determining coupon payments, price at [maturity](../m/maturity.md), and financial calculations such as [yield](../y/yield.md). In [stocks](../s/stock.md), par [value](../v/value.md) is largely a formality and holds minimal financial impact in modern issuance practices. Understanding par [value](../v/value.md)'s application, alongside concepts such as [bond](../b/bond.md) premiums, discounts, and no-par-[value](../v/value.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md), is essential for any financial professional navigating the trading and investment landscape.

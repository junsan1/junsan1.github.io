# Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI)

The Purchasing Managers' [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (PMI) is an [economic indicator](../e/economic_indicator.md) derived from monthly surveys of [private sector](../p/private_sector.md) companies. The PMI aims to provide a snapshot of the health of the [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) and service sectors, [offering](../o/offering.md) insights into economic trends and potential future changes in [business](../b/business.md) conditions. It is widely used by financial [market](../m/market.md) participants, policymakers, and economic analysts.

### Understanding the PMI

The PMI is primarily based on five major indicators:

1. **New Orders**: This measures the pace at which orders are being placed for future delivery of goods or services.
2. **[Inventory](../i/inventory.md) Levels**: This assesses the current levels of unsold goods or materials on hand.
3. **Production Output**: This measures the actual quantity of goods or services produced over a specific period.
4. **Supplier Deliveries**: This evaluates the speed and timeliness of suppliers in delivering ordered goods or services.
5. **Employment Levels**: This assesses the current level of employment within companies, indicating hiring or [layoff](../l/layoff.md) trends.

Each of these components has a specific weight in the PMI calculation, and they contribute to the overall [index](../i/index_instrument.md) in varying degrees. The PMI ranges from 0 to 100, where:

- A PMI above 50 indicates an [expansion](../e/expansion.md) compared to the previous month.
- A PMI below 50 indicates a contraction compared to the previous month.
- A PMI around 50 indicates no change.

### Types of PMIs

There are different types of PMIs based on the sector they examine:

1. **[Manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) PMI**: Focuses on the [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) sector. It provides insights into factory production, employment trends, supplier deliveries, and [inventory](../i/inventory.md) levels.
   
2. **Services PMI**: Focuses on the [service sector](../s/service_sector.md), assessing new [business](../b/business.md) [volume](../v/volume.md), [business](../b/business.md) activity, employment trends, and pricing information.
   
3. **Composite PMI**: Combines data from both the [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) and services PMIs to [offer](../o/offer.md) a broader view of the [economy](../e/economy.md).

### Methodology

The PMI is compiled through surveys conducted by organizations like Markit (now IHS Markit, part of S&P Global) and the Institute for [Supply](../s/supply.md) Management (ISM) in the United States. The surveys are sent to purchasing managers across various sectors, and the data collected is seasonally adjusted to account for fluctuations that could distort the trends.

The formula to calculate PMI is:
```
PMI = (P1 * 1) + (P2 * 0.5) + (P3 * 0)
```
Where,
- `P1` is the percentage of respondents reporting an improvement.
- `P2` is the percentage of respondents reporting no change.
- `P3` is the percentage of respondents reporting a deterioration.

### Importance of PMI

1. **[Economic Forecasting](../e/economic_forecasting.md)**: Because the PMI is based on survey data that provides a real-time view of [business](../b/business.md) conditions, it is used as a [leading indicator](../l/leading_indicator.md) for [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) and contraction.

2. **Investment Decisions**: Investors closely watch PMI readings to make informed decisions. A high PMI may suggest [robust](../r/robust.md) [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md), potentially leading to rising stock prices, whereas a low PMI may indicate economic trouble, where investors might shift to safer assets.

3. **Policy Formulation**: Central banks and governments use PMI data to form monetary and fiscal policies. For instance, a decreasing PMI might prompt central banks to consider lowering [interest](../i/interest.md) rates to stimulate the [economy](../e/economy.md).

4. **[Business](../b/business.md) Planning**: Companies use PMI data to plan their operations. For example, a rising PMI may encourage a [business](../b/business.md) to increase production and hiring, while a falling PMI may lead to caution in investment and [expansion](../e/expansion.md) plans.

### Limitations of PMI

While PMI is a valuable tool, it has limitations:

1. **Subjectivity**: PMI is based on surveys, which include a certain level of subjectivity. The responses are influenced by personal perceptions and experiences of the purchasing managers surveyed.

2. **Sector Bias**: PMI predominantly focuses on large companies and might not accurately reflect the conditions of smaller businesses.

3. **Short-Term [Indicator](../i/indicator.md)**: PMI is more of a short-term [economic indicator](../e/economic_indicator.md) and might not give a full picture of long-term trends.

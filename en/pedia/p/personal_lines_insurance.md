### Coverage Needs

Individuals should assess their specific needs and risks to determine the appropriate types of coverage. For instance, a homeowner living in a flood-prone area might need additional flood [insurance](../i/insurance.md).

### Exclusions

[Insurance](../i/insurance.md) policies often contain exclusions, which are specific conditions or circumstances not covered by the policy. It’s essential to read and understand these exclusions to avoid unexpected [gaps](../g/gap.md) in coverage.

### Discounts

Many [insurance](../i/insurance.md) providers [offer](../o/offer.md) discounts for various reasons, such as bundling [multiple](../m/multiple.md) policies, having a good driving record, or installing safety devices in the [home](../h/home.md) or vehicle.

# Per Capita GDP

[Per capita](../p/per_capita.md) GDP, or Gross Domestic Product [per capita](../p/per_capita.md), is a metric used to measure the average economic output per person in a specific geographic area, such as a country, region, or city. This figure is derived by dividing a country's total GDP by its population, providing insight into the relative economic well-being of its residents. This metric is widely employed by economists, policymakers, and analysts to assess and compare the economic performance and living standards across different nations or regions.

[Per capita](../p/per_capita.md) GDP is considered a crucial [indicator](../i/indicator.md) because it takes into account the size of the population, thereby giving a more precise picture of economic prosperity than total GDP alone. By evaluating the [per capita](../p/per_capita.md) economic output, one can ascertain how effectively a country utilizes its resources to provide for its population. Moreover, it serves as a [proxy](../p/proxy.md) for the average [standard of living](../s/standard_of_living.md) and can highlight disparities in [income](../i/income.md) and [wealth](../w/wealth.md) [distribution](../d/distribution.md).

## Calculation of Per Capita GDP

The formula for calculating [per capita](../p/per_capita.md) GDP is straightforward:

\[ \text{[Per Capita](../p/per_capita.md) GDP} = \frac{\text{Total GDP}}{\text{Population}} \]

Where:
- **Total GDP** is the sum of all goods and services produced in an [economy](../e/economy.md) over a specific period, usually one year.
- **Population** is the total number of people residing in that [economy](../e/economy.md).

For example, if a country has a GDP of $1 trillion and a population of 50 million people, its [per capita](../p/per_capita.md) GDP would be:

\[ \text{[Per Capita](../p/per_capita.md) GDP} = \frac{1,000,000,000,000}{50,000,000} = 20,000 \]

Therefore, the [per capita](../p/per_capita.md) GDP would be $20,000, indicating that, on average, each person contributes $20,000 to the [economy](../e/economy.md).

## Significance of Per Capita GDP

### Economic Performance

[Per capita](../p/per_capita.md) GDP is a critical measure for assessing the economic performance of a country. Higher [per capita](../p/per_capita.md) GDP generally suggests better [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md) and higher living standards. It indicates that the country is producing more [economic value](../e/economic_value.md) per person, which could be a result of higher [productivity](../p/productivity.md), better utilization of resources, or more advanced technology.

### Living Standards

One of the primary uses of [per capita](../p/per_capita.md) GDP is to gauge the [standard of living](../s/standard_of_living.md). Higher [per capita](../p/per_capita.md) GDP typically correlates with better access to essential services such as healthcare, education, and [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md), as well as greater [disposable income](../d/disposable_income.md). However, it is important to [note](../n/note.md) that [per capita](../p/per_capita.md) GDP does not account for [income inequality](../i/income_inequality.md); thus, high [per capita](../p/per_capita.md) GDP could still mask significant disparities in [wealth](../w/wealth.md) [distribution](../d/distribution.md) within the population.

### Policy-Making

Policymakers often use [per capita](../p/per_capita.md) GDP to formulate economic policies and allocate resources. By understanding how economic output is distributed among the population, governments can implement targeted measures to promote [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md), reduce [poverty](../p/poverty.md), and address regional disparities. [Per capita](../p/per_capita.md) GDP can also serve as a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for setting fiscal and monetary policies.

### International Comparisons

[Per capita](../p/per_capita.md) GDP allows for meaningful comparisons between countries, regardless of their population size. It provides a standardized metric to evaluate and compare the economic prosperity of different nations. International organizations, such as the [World Bank](../w/world_bank.md) and the International Monetary [Fund](../f/fund.md) (IMF), regularly publish [per capita](../p/per_capita.md) GDP figures, which are used by analysts and researchers to conduct cross-country studies and analyses.

## Limitations of Per Capita GDP

Despite its usefulness, [per capita](../p/per_capita.md) GDP has several limitations:

### Income Inequality

[Per capita](../p/per_capita.md) GDP does not account for the [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of [income](../i/income.md) within a country. A high [per capita](../p/per_capita.md) GDP could coexist with significant [income inequality](../i/income_inequality.md), where a small proportion of the population holds a large share of the [wealth](../w/wealth.md). As a result, many individuals may not benefit from the overall economic prosperity.

### Non-Market Transactions

[Per capita](../p/per_capita.md) GDP excludes non-[market](../m/market.md) transactions, such as household labor and volunteer work, which contribute to the [economy](../e/economy.md) but do not have a [market price](../m/market_price.md). Consequently, it may underestimate the true [economic value](../e/economic_value.md) generated by the population.

### Environmental Degradation

Economic activities that increase GDP can also have negative environmental impacts. [Per capita](../p/per_capita.md) GDP does not consider the [depletion](../d/depletion.md) of natural resources or environmental degradation, which can undermine long-term economic sustainability and living standards.

### Quality of Life

While higher [per capita](../p/per_capita.md) GDP is often associated with better living standards, it does not directly measure factors that contribute to [quality of life](../q/quality_of_life.md), such as health, education, [security](../s/security.md), and leisure. Other indices, like the Human Development [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (HDI), may provide a more comprehensive assessment of well-being.

## Alternative Measures

Given the limitations of [per capita](../p/per_capita.md) GDP, alternative measures have been developed to provide a more holistic view of economic and social progress:

### Human Development Index (HDI)

The Human Development [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (HDI), developed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), combines [per capita](../p/per_capita.md) [income](../i/income.md) with indicators of health ([life expectancy](../l/life_expectancy.md)) and education (mean years of schooling and expected years of schooling) to provide a more comprehensive measure of well-being.

### Gross National Happiness (GNH)

Gross National Happiness (GNH) is an alternative measure adopted by Bhutan, emphasizing the well-being and happiness of its citizens rather than purely economic metrics. GNH includes factors such as psychological well-being, cultural diversity, and ecological resilience.

### Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI)

The Genuine Progress [Indicator](../i/indicator.md) (GPI) adjusts GDP by [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for factors such as [income](../i/income.md) [distribution](../d/distribution.md), environmental costs, and changes in leisure time. The GPI aims to provide a more accurate representation of economic progress and sustainable development.

## Conclusion

[Per capita](../p/per_capita.md) GDP is a vital [economic indicator](../e/economic_indicator.md) that provides insights into the relative economic performance and living standards of different countries or regions. While it offers valuable information for policymakers and analysts, it is essential to recognize its limitations and consider complementary measures to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of economic and social progress. By combining [per capita](../p/per_capita.md) GDP with other indices, such as HDI, GNH, and GPI, one can achieve a more nuanced perspective on the well-being and sustainability of an [economy](../e/economy.md).

# Perseroan Terbatas (PT)

A Perseroan Terbatas (PT) is an Indonesian legal entity recognized as a [limited liability](../l/limited_liability.md) company, which is primarily used in [business](../b/business.md) operations. It is the most common type of [business](../b/business.md) organization in Indonesia, similar to the structure of a [corporation](../c/corporation.md) in the United States or a GmbH in Germany. This entity is governed by Indonesian corporate law and its operations are subject to various regulations and compliance requirements. Here's a detailed breakdown of a PT:

## Legal Framework

The principles that govern the establishment and operation of a PT are outlined in the Indonesian Company Law, Law No. 40 of 2007 on [Limited Liability](../l/limited_liability.md) Companies. This law provides the legal framework for the [incorporation](../i/incorporation.md), structure, and governance of PTs in Indonesia.

## Characteristics of a PT

### Limited Liability

In a PT, shareholders' [liability](../l/liability.md) is limited to the amount of [capital](../c/capital.md) they have invested. This means that shareholders are not personally liable for the debts and [obligations](../o/obligation.md) of the company beyond their investment in the company's [shares](../s/shares.md).

### Separate Legal Entity

A PT is recognized as a legal entity that is distinct from its shareholders. This grants the company the ability to enter into contracts, own assets, sue, and be sued in its own name.

### Share Capital

The company’s [capital](../c/capital.md) is divided into [shares](../s/shares.md), and the ownership of the company is represented by these [shares](../s/shares.md). Shareholders have the right to transfer their [shares](../s/shares.md), although such transactions may be subject to approval by other shareholders or the board of directors in certain cases.

## Formation Process

### Name Reservation

Before establishing a PT, the founders must reserve the company name with the Ministry of Law and Human Rights. The name must be unique and not similar to existing company names.

### Deed of Establishment

The founders must draft a [deed](../d/deed.md) of establishment, which includes the company's [Articles of Association](../a/articles_of_association.md) (AoA). The AoA outlines the company's operational guidelines, including the company's purpose, structure, and regulations regarding [shares](../s/shares.md) and share transfers.

### Notary

The [deed](../d/deed.md) of establishment must be notarized by a public notary. The notary [will](../w/will.md) ensure that the [deed](../d/deed.md) complies with all legal requirements and the founders' intentions.

### Approval and Registration

The notarized [deed](../d/deed.md) must be submitted to the Ministry of Law and Human Rights for approval. Once approved, the company must register with the relevant local government office, the Directorate General of [Taxes](../t/taxes.md), and other appropriate government agencies.

## Corporate Structure

### General Meeting of Shareholders (GMS)

The GMS is the highest authority in a PT. It consists of all shareholders and has the power to make critical decisions, such as amending the AoA, appointing and dismissing directors and commissioners, and approving [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md).

### Board of Directors

The board of directors is responsible for managing the company’s day-to-day operations. Directors are appointed by the GMS and act as representatives of the company in dealings with third parties.

### Board of Commissioners

The board of commissioners supervises the board of directors and ensures that management operates in the best interests of the shareholders. Commissioners are also appointed by the GMS and have the authority to review company policies and [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md).

## Compliance Requirements

### Annual GMS

A PT must [hold](../h/hold.md) an annual GMS at least once a year to approve the company's [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md), discuss the company’s performance, and make necessary decisions.
 
### Financial Reporting

A PT is required to maintain proper [accounting](../a/accounting.md) records and prepare [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) in accordance with Indonesian [Financial Accounting](../f/financial_accounting.md) Standards (SAK). The [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) must be audited by a licensed public [accountant](../a/accountant.md) if the company meets certain criteria.

### Tax Obligations

A PT must register for a [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) identification number (NPWP) and comply with Indonesian tax laws, including corporate [income tax](../i/income_tax.md), [value](../v/value.md)-added tax (VAT), and employee [income tax](../i/income_tax.md).

### Business Licenses

Depending on the nature of its [business](../b/business.md), a PT may need to obtain various licenses and permits from government authorities. These could include [business](../b/business.md) licenses, [import](../i/import.md)/[export](../e/export.md) licenses, and specific operational permits.

## Advantages

### Credibility

The establishment of a PT enhances its credibility and attracts investors, customers, and [business](../b/business.md) partners. The formal structure and regulatory oversight lend stability and trustworthiness to the [business](../b/business.md).

### Capital Accumulation

A PT has the ability to raise significant [capital](../c/capital.md) by issuing [shares](../s/shares.md). This facilitates [expansion](../e/expansion.md) and growth opportunities for the company.

### Continuity

The existence of a PT is not affected by changes in ownership or the death of shareholders. This ensures [business](../b/business.md) continuity and stability.

## Disadvantages

### Regulatory Burden

The formation and operation of a PT involve compliance with numerous regulations, which can be time-consuming and costly. This includes regular reporting, conducting annual GMS, and maintaining clear documentation.

### Profit Sharing

Profits of a PT must be distributed to shareholders in accordance with their shareholdings, which means individual shareholders do not retain full control over the company's [earnings](../e/earnings.md).

## Conclusion

A Perseroan Terbatas (PT) offers a structured and legally recognized way to conduct [business](../b/business.md) in Indonesia. While it involves significant regulatory compliance, its benefits in terms of [limited liability](../l/limited_liability.md), [capital](../c/capital.md) raising, and [business](../b/business.md) continuity make it an attractive option for entrepreneurs and investors.

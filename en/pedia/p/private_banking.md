# Private Banking

Private banking refers to a suite of personalized financial and banking services offered to high-net-worth individuals (HNWI) by financial institutions. These services typically encompass a wide range of financial products, including investment management, estate planning, tax advisory, and customized banking.

Private banking is distinct from retail banking primarily because of its highly tailored approach. While retail banking provides standardized services to the general public, private banking aims to cater to the specific, often complex financial needs of affluent clients.

## Historical Background

The origins of private banking can be traced back to the merchant bankers of Europe, who began offering specialized banking services to wealthy clients in the 17th and 18th centuries. Prominent families like the Rothschilds built their banking empires on the principles of discretion, trust, and personalized service.

## Modern Services

- **Portfolio Management:** Advising clients on a mix of equity, fixed-income, and alternative investments.
- **Asset Allocation:** Diversifying investments to balance risk and return.

### Estate Planning

Estate planning ensures that an individual's wealth is transferred according to their wishes after they pass away. This involves:

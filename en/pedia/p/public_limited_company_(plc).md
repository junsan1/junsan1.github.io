# Public Limited Company (PLC)

A Public Limited Company (PLC) is a type of [business](../b/business.md) entity in many jurisdictions, predominantly in the United Kingdom, that offers its [shares](../s/shares.md) to the general public. The public can acquire these [shares](../s/shares.md) through a stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md), which provides the ability for both institutional and individual investors to purchase ownership stakes in the company. This method of shareholding is one of the defining characteristics that differentiates a PLC from a [private company](../p/private_company.md) limited by [shares](../s/shares.md), which restricts the [sale](../s/sale.md) and transfer of its [shares](../s/shares.md).

## Characteristics of a Public Limited Company

### Limited Liability
One of the primary benefits of a PLC is [limited liability](../l/limited_liability.md) for its shareholders. Shareholders are only liable for the amount they invested in the company, and their personal assets are not at [risk](../r/risk.md) if the company faces financial difficulties.

### Minimum Capital Requirement
In the UK, a PLC must have a minimum allotted share [capital](../c/capital.md) of £50,000, of which at least 25% must be paid up before the company can commence [business](../b/business.md) or [exercise](../e/exercise.md) any borrowing powers.

### Shareholder Arrangement
A PLC can [issue](../i/issue.md) [shares](../s/shares.md) to the public, and these [shares](../s/shares.md) can be freely sold and traded on the [open market](../o/open_market.md). This provides a valuable source of [capital](../c/capital.md), as the company can raise funds from a vast pool of public investors.

### Regulatory Compliance
PLCs are subject to stringent regulatory requirements and must adhere to strict reporting and [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) standards. This [transparency](../t/transparency.md) is necessary to protect public shareholders and helps maintain [investor](../i/investor.md) confidence. The Companies Act 2006 regulates PLCs in the UK, while other countries have similar frameworks in place.

### Board of Directors
The management and day-to-day operations of a PLC are overseen by a board of directors elected by the shareholders. This governance structure aims to ensure that the company's activities align with the broader interests of its shareholders.

## Advantages of a Public Limited Company

### Access to Capital
One of the most significant advantages of a PLC is its ability to raise [capital](../c/capital.md). By issuing [shares](../s/shares.md) to the public, a PLC can access substantial amounts of investment [capital](../c/capital.md) that can be used for [expansion](../e/expansion.md), research and development, [debt](../d/debt.md) reduction, or other corporate purposes.

### Enhanced Credibility
Being [listed](../l/listed.md) on a stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md) often enhances the reputation and credibility of a PLC. This can make it easier to attract further investment, enter into partnerships, and attract top talent to the organization.

### Liquidity for Shareholders
[Shares](../s/shares.md) in a PLC are typically more [liquid](../l/liquid.md) than in a [private company](../p/private_company.md). Shareholders can easily buy or sell their [shares](../s/shares.md) on the [stock market](../s/stock_market.md), providing them with flexibility and instant access to [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).

### Growth and Expansion Opportunities
With increased [capital](../c/capital.md) from public investors, a PLC is well-positioned to undertake significant growth and [expansion](../e/expansion.md) initiatives. This can include launching new products, entering new markets, or acquiring other businesses.

## Disadvantages of a Public Limited Company

### Regulatory Scrutiny
One of the main drawbacks of being a PLC is the level of regulatory scrutiny the company faces. PLCs must comply with extensive legal and regulatory requirements, which can be costly and time-consuming.

### Ownership Dilution
When a PLC issues new [shares](../s/shares.md), the ownership percentage of existing shareholders is diluted unless they purchase additional [shares](../s/shares.md) to maintain their ownership stake. This can be seen as a disadvantage, especially if current shareholders wish to retain a larger controlling [interest](../i/interest.md) in the company.

### Public Disclosure
PLCs are required to disclose significant amounts of information about their [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md), strategic plans, and other critical aspects of the [business](../b/business.md). This mandatory [transparency](../t/transparency.md) can be advantageous for investors but may also expose sensitive [business](../b/business.md) information to competitors.

### Pressure from Shareholders
PLCs often face pressure from shareholders to deliver short-term [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) and share price appreciation. This can lead to decisions that favor immediate gains over long-term strategic goals.

## Lifecycle of a Public Limited Company

### Formation
To form a PLC, several legal procedures must be accomplished. This includes drafting the company’s Memorandum of Association and [Articles of Association](../a/articles_of_association.md), appointing directors, and allocating initial share [capital](../c/capital.md). In the UK, a PLC must also register with Companies House.

### Initial Public Offering (IPO)
An IPO is the process through which a [private company](../p/private_company.md) sells its [shares](../s/shares.md) to the public for the first time and becomes a PLC. This involves considerable preparation, including regulatory approval, financial audits, and often, the assistance of underwriters to price and sell the [shares](../s/shares.md).

### Ongoing Operations
Once public, a PLC must continue to comply with regulatory requirements, provide regular financial reports, and [hold](../h/hold.md) annual general meetings (AGMs) for shareholders. The board of directors is responsible for ensuring the company remains compliant and continues to pursue its [business](../b/business.md) objectives.

### Potential Delisting or Buyout
A PLC may eventually choose to delist from the stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md), returning to private ownership. This can occur through a [buyout](../b/buyout.md), often termed a management [buyout](../b/buyout.md) if done by the company's executives, or when the company is acquired by another entity.

## Conclusion

A Public Limited Company (PLC) provides a unique structure that facilitates access to vast pools of [capital](../c/capital.md), enhances corporate credibility, and offers [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) to shareholders.

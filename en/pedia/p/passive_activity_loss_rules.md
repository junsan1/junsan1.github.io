# Passive Activity Loss Rules

The Passive Activity Loss (PAL) Rules are a set of regulations established by the Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Service (IRS) under the [Tax Reform Act of 1986](../t/tax_reform_act_of_1986.md) in the United States. These rules are designed to limit the ability of taxpayers to use losses from passive activities to [offset](../o/offset.md) [income](../i/income.md) from other sources. This can have significant implications for investors, particularly those involved in [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) and other types of investments that might be considered "passive."

## Definition of Passive Activities

Passive activities are defined by the IRS as any [business](../b/business.md) or [trade](../t/trade.md) activities in which the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) does not materially participate. Material participation is generally understood as regular, continuous, and substantial involvement in the operations of the activity. For most taxpayers, this means that any rental activities and any [business](../b/business.md) in which they do not play an active role are considered passive activities.

### Examples of Passive Activities

- **Rental Properties:** Most rental [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) activities are considered passive regardless of the level of participation by the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md).
- **Limited Partnerships:** Investments in limited partnerships are typically considered passive activities because limited partners do not materially participate in the [business](../b/business.md).
- **Syndicated Investments:** Investments in syndicated projects, such as oil and gas exploration partnerships or similar investment groups where the [investor](../i/investor.md)’s role is limited.

## Qualifying as Material Participation

To avoid the classification as passive, and thereby avoid the restrictions of the PAL rules, a [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) can qualify as materially participating by meeting one of the seven IRS tests for material participation, such as:

1. The individual works 500 hours or more during the year in the activity.
2. The individual does substantially all of the work in the activity.
3. The individual works more than 100 hours in the activity and no one else works more.
4. The individual's activity is a "significant participation activity" and their combined participation in all such activities exceeds 500 hours.

## Limitations Imposed by PAL Rules

### Offsetting Income

The primary limitation imposed by the PAL rules is that losses from passive activities can only be used to [offset](../o/offset.md) [income](../i/income.md) from other passive activities. They cannot be used to [offset](../o/offset.md) active [income](../i/income.md), such as wages or salaries, or portfolio [income](../i/income.md), such as dividends or [interest](../i/interest.md).

### Carryforward of Losses

If a [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) cannot use passive losses in a given year because they do not have enough [passive income](../p/passive_income.md) to [offset](../o/offset.md) those losses, the unused losses can be carried forward to future years. This means that if the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) generates [passive income](../p/passive_income.md) in subsequent years, they can then use the carried-forward losses to [offset](../o/offset.md) that [income](../i/income.md).

## Exceptions to PAL Rules

There are some exceptions to the PAL rules that allow taxpayers to use passive losses to [offset](../o/offset.md) other types of [income](../i/income.md):

### Real Estate Professionals

Taxpayers who qualify as [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) professionals are not subject to the PAL rules for their [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) activities. To qualify, taxpayers must meet two criteria:
1. More than half of the personal services the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) performs in trades or businesses during the year must be in [real property](../r/real_property.md) trades or businesses in which the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) materially participates.
2. The [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) must perform more than 750 hours of services during the year in [real property](../r/real_property.md) trades or businesses in which the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) materially participates.

### Active Participation Exception

Rental [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) activities have an additional exception known as the "active participation exception." This allows taxpayers who actively participate in rental [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) activities to [offset](../o/offset.md) up to $25,000 of passive losses against non-[passive income](../p/passive_income.md). The active participation standard is less stringent than the material participation standard, requiring only a bona fide involvement in management decisions. However, this exception phases out for taxpayers with adjusted [gross income](../g/gross_income.md) between $100,000 and $150,000.

### Disposition of Passive Activities

Passive losses that have been suspended because they could not be used in the year incurred can also be recognized when the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) disposes of their entire [interest](../i/interest.md) in the passive activity. If the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) sells or otherwise fully disposes of the passive activity, they can recognize the total accumulated passive losses against any type of [income](../i/income.md).

## Tax Planning Considerations

Understanding the PAL rules is crucial for [tax planning](../t/tax_planning.md), especially for high-net-worth individuals and those heavily invested in passive activities like [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) or limited partnerships. Here are several strategies and considerations:

### Grouping Activities

Taxpayers can group [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [business activities](../b/business_activities.md) into a single activity if the grouped activities constitute an appropriate economic unit. Grouping can help in meeting the material participation criteria by aggregating the hours worked across different but related activities.

### Timing of Losses

Investors can consider the timing of when they recognize [income](../i/income.md) and losses from passive activities. If possible, aligning the gaining years with years that the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) has [passive income](../p/passive_income.md) can effectively utilize passive losses.

### Professional Advice

Given the complexity of passive activity loss rules and their impact on an individual’s [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md), it is often beneficial to consult a tax professional. A tax advisor can help in navigating the rules, planning strategically, and ensuring compliance with IRS requirements.

## Conclusion

The Passive Activity Loss Rules form an essential part of the tax code for investors involved in passive activities. These rules restrict the ability to use passive activity losses to [offset](../o/offset.md) other types of [income](../i/income.md), requiring strategic planning and, in many cases, professional advice to navigate effectively. Understanding these rules and the potential exceptions is critical to making informed investment and [tax planning](../t/tax_planning.md) decisions.

# Personal Financial Specialist (PFS)

A Personal Financial Specialist (PFS) is a designation awarded by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) to CPAs who have demonstrated their knowledge and experience in personal financial planning. The PFS designation represents a CPA’s expertise in areas such as estate planning, retirement planning, investments, and insurance.

## Overview

The financial services industry has many designations and certifications, but the PFS stands out because it requires the holder to be a licensed Certified Public Accountant (CPA) in good standing. This requirement ensures that PFS credential holders possess a high level of accounting and tax knowledge, positioned to serve clients comprehensively.

## History of PFS

The PFS designation was introduced by the AICPA in 1987 to address the growing need for accounting professionals to provide comprehensive financial planning services. This evolution was driven by increasing complexity in financial markets, tax regulations, and the convergence of global economies, all necessitating a higher level of specialization in personal financial planning.

## Eligibility and Requirements

To qualify for the PFS designation, candidates must meet several specific criteria:
- **Education and CPA License:** Candidates must hold a valid CPA license and be a member of the AICPA.
- **Experience:** Candidates need to have at least 3,000 hours of personal financial planning business experience or teaching experience over a five-year period concluding with the date of the PFS application.
- **Examinations:** Candidates must pass the PFP (Personal Financial Planning) exam, unless they qualify for an exemption based on other relevant credentials such as the CFP (Certified Financial Planner).
- **Continuing Professional Education (CPE):** Maintain at least 60 hours of PFP-related CPE every three years as part of the CPA CPE requirement.

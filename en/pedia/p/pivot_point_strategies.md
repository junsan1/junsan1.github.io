# Pivot Point Strategies in Algorithmic Trading

Pivot Point strategies are a widely used approach in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) to identify potential [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels in the market. These strategies revolve around the calculation and use of [Pivot Points](../p/pivot_points.md), which are derived from the previous trading day's high, low, and closing prices. [Pivot Points](../p/pivot_points.md) provide traders with potential entry and exit points for their trades and are especially popular among day traders and scalpers. Below is an in-depth exploration of Pivot Point strategies, their calculation, implementation, and application in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md).

## Calculation of Pivot Points

### Basic Pivot Point (P)

The central Pivot Point (P) is calculated using the following formula:

\[ P = \frac{(High_{previous} + Low_{previous} + Close_{previous})}{3} \]

Where:
- \( High_{previous} \) is the highest price of the previous trading day.
- \( Low_{previous} \) is the lowest price of the previous trading day.
- \( Close_{previous} \) is the closing price of the previous trading day.

### Support and Resistance Levels

Once the central Pivot Point (P) is determined, additional [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels can be calculated as follows:

#### First Level of Resistance (R1) and Support (S1)

\[ R1 = (2 \times P) - Low_{previous} \]
\[ S1 = (2 \times P) - High_{previous} \]

#### Second Level of Resistance (R2) and Support (S2)

\[ R2 = P + (High_{previous} - Low_{previous}) \]
\[ S2 = P - (High_{previous} - Low_{previous}) \]

#### Third Level of Resistance (R3) and Support (S3)

\[ R3 = High_{previous} + 2 \times (P - Low_{previous}) \]
\[ S3 = Low_{previous} - 2 \times (High_{previous} - P) \]

## Types of Pivot Points

### Standard Pivot Points
Standard [Pivot Points](../p/pivot_points.md), as described above, use the previous trading day's high, low, and close values. They are the most commonly used type of [Pivot Points](../p/pivot_points.md).

### Fibonacci Pivot Points
Fibonacci [Pivot Points](../p/pivot_points.md) incorporate Fibonacci retracement and extension levels into the calculation of [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels:

#### Pivot Point (P)

\[ P = \frac{(High_{previous} + Low_{previous} + Close_{previous})}{3} \]

#### Support and Resistance Levels

\[ R1 = P + 0.382 \times (High_{previous} - Low_{previous}) \]
\[ R2 = P + 0.618 \times (High_{previous} - Low_{previous}) \]
\[ R3 = P + (High_{previous} - Low_{previous}) \]

\[ S1 = P - 0.382 \times (High_{previous} - Low_{previous}) \]
\[ S2 = P - 0.618 \times (High_{previous} - Low_{previous}) \]
\[ S3 = P - (High_{previous} - Low_{previous}) \]

### Woodie's Pivot Points
Woodie's [Pivot Points](../p/pivot_points.md) give more weight to the closing price of the previous trading period:

#### Pivot Point (P)

\[ P = \frac{(High_{current} + Low_{current} + 2 \times Close_{previous})}{4} \]

#### Support and Resistance Levels

\[ R1 = 2 \times P - Low_{current} \]
\[ S1 = 2 \times P - High_{current} \]
\[ R2 = P + (High_{current} - Low_{current}) \]
\[ S2 = P - (High_{current} - Low_{current}) \]

### Camarilla Pivot Points
Camarilla [Pivot Points](../p/pivot_points.md) were developed by Nick Stott in the late 1980s and use closing prices and a series of multipliers to calculate [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels:

\[ R1 = Close_{previous} + (High_{previous} - Low_{previous}) \times 1.1 \times \frac{1}{20} \]
\[ R2 = Close_{previous} + (High_{previous} - Low_{previous}) \times 1.1 \times \frac{2}{20} \]
\[ R3 = Close_{previous} + (High_{previous} - Low_{previous}) \times 1.1 \times \frac{3}{20} \]
\[ R4 = Close_{previous} + (High_{previous} - Low_{previous}) \times 1.1 \times \frac{4}{20} \]

\[ S1 = Close_{previous} - (High_{previous} - Low_{previous}) \times 1.1 \times \frac{1}{20} \]
\[ S2 = Close_{previous} - (High_{previous} - Low_{previous}) \times 1.1 \times \frac{2}{20} \]
\[ S3 = Close_{previous} - (High_{previous} - Low_{previous}) \times 1.1 \times \frac{3}{20} \]
\[ S4 = Close_{previous} - (High_{previous} - Low_{previous}) \times 1.1 \times \frac{4}{20} \]

### DeMark's Pivot Points
DeMark's [Pivot Points](../p/pivot_points.md), named after Tom DeMark, use a different approach to calculate the central [Pivot Points](../p/pivot_points.md):

#### X Value Definition Based on Close

\[ X = \begin{cases} 
High_{previous} + Low_{previous} + 2 \times Close_{previous}, & \text{if Close_{previous} < Open_{previous}} \\
High_{previous} + 2 \times Low_{previous} + Close_{previous}, & \text{if Close_{previous} > Open_{previous}} \\
2 \times (High_{previous} + Low_{previous}), & \text{if Close_{previous} = Open_{previous}} 
\end{cases}
\]

#### Central Pivot Point (P)

\[ P = X / 4 \]

#### Support and Resistance Levels

\[ R1 = X / 2 - Low_{previous} \]
\[ S1 = X / 2 - High_{previous} \]

## Implementing Pivot Point Strategies in Algorithmic Trading

### Reversal Trading Strategy

One of the most common strategies using [Pivot Points](../p/pivot_points.md) is the Reversal Trading Strategy. This strategy involves taking buy or sell positions when the price reverses at key Pivot Point levels.

- **Buy Signal**: When the price falls to a support level (S1, S2, or S3) and shows signs of reversing, a buy signal is generated.
- **Sell Signal**: When the price rises to a resistance level (R1, R2, or R3) and shows signs of reversing, a sell signal is generated.

### Breakout Trading Strategy

In a [Breakout Trading](../b/breakout_trading.md) Strategy, traders look for prices to break through key Pivot Point levels with substantial volume, indicating the potential for a continued move in the breakout direction.

- **Buy Signal**: When the price breaks through a resistance level (R1, R2, or R3) with increased volume, a buy signal is generated.
- **Sell Signal**: When the price breaks through a support level (S1, S2, or S3) with increased volume, a sell signal is generated.

### Range-Bound Trading Strategy

For markets that tend to trade within tight ranges, the Range-Bound Trading Strategy involves buying at [support levels](../s/support_levels.md) and selling at resistance levels.

- **Buy Signal**: When the price reaches a support level and moves sideways, potential for a range-bound trade.
- **Sell Signal**: When the price reaches a resistance level and moves sideways, potential for a range-bound trade.

### Combining Pivot Points with Other Indicators

Combining [Pivot Points](../p/pivot_points.md) with other [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) can enhance the effectiveness of [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). Commonly combined indicators include:

- **Moving Averages**: To confirm the trend direction when a Pivot Point level is reached.
- **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: To identify overbought or oversold conditions at Pivot Point levels.
- **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**: To validate momentum at Pivot Point levels.

## Example of an Algorithm Using Pivot Points

Below is a basic example of a Python algorithm using [Pivot Points](../p/pivot_points.md) and the `pandas` and `numpy` libraries:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def calculate_pivot_points(df):
    df['P'] = (df['High'] + df['Low'] + df['Close']) / 3
    df['R1'] = (2 * df['P']) - df['Low']
    df['S1'] = (2 * df['P']) - df['High']
    df['R2'] = df['P'] + (df['High'] - df['Low'])
    df['S2'] = df['P'] - (df['High'] - df['Low'])
    df['R3'] = df['High'] + 2 * (df['P'] - df['Low'])
    df['S3'] = df['Low'] - 2 * (df['High'] - df['P'])
    return df

def trading_signal(df):
    conditions = [
        (df['Close'] < df['S1']),
        (df['Close'] > df['R1'])
    ]
    choices = ['Sell', 'Buy']
    df['Signal'] = np.select(conditions, choices, default='Hold')
    return df

# Sample DataFrame
data = {
    'Date': pd.date_range(start='2023-01-01', periods=5, freq='D'),
    'High': [150, 155, 160, 165, 170],
    'Low': [140, 142, 145, 148, 150],
    'Close': [147, 150, 155, 160, 165]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df = calculate_pivot_points(df)
df = trading_signal(df)

print(df)
```

These strategies leverage historical price data to identify key levels where the market sentiment may shift. Implementing Pivot Point strategies in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) involves calculating [Pivot Points](../p/pivot_points.md), determining [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels, and developing algorithms that generate [trading signals](../t/trading_signals.md) based on these levels.

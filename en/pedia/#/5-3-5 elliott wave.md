# 5-3-5 Elliott Wave

The Elliott Wave Principle, named after Ralph Nelson Elliott, is a form of technical analysis that traders use to analyze financial market cycles and forecast future market behavior by identifying extremes in investor psychology, highs and lows in prices, and other collective factors. One of its fundamental patterns is the 5-3-5 Elliott Wave, a combination of impulse waves and corrective waves.

## Understanding the Elliott Wave Principle

At the core of the Elliott Wave Principle is a cycle of repetitive waves that can be observed in financial markets. These waves can be broken down into patterns of smaller waves. Elliott noted that market prices unfold in specific patterns, which are repetitive in form but not necessarily in time or amplitude. Therefore, these waves are fractal by nature.

An Elliott wave pattern consists of a five-wave motive phase followed by a three-wave corrective phase. This sequence of eight waves forms one complete cycle. The motive phase consists of five waves labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, while the corrective phase consists of three waves labeled A, B, and C.

## The 5-3-5 Pattern

The 5-3-5 pattern is a specific configuration within the Elliott Wave Principle. It describes a correction structure that occurs as part of a larger wave sequence. This correction is typically an A-B-C pattern, where both wave A and wave C consist of five sub-waves (impulse waves), while wave B comprises three sub-waves (corrective waves). This pattern can appear in different contexts, such as a zigzag correction, which is one of the many corrective patterns identified by Elliott.

### The Components of the 5-3-5 Pattern

#### Impulse Waves (A and C)

Impulse waves are powerful trend-following waves that go in the direction of the larger trend. In the 5-3-5 pattern:
  - **Wave A** and **Wave C** each consists of five sub-waves.
  - These sub-waves are labeled as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

#### Corrective Waves (B)

The corrective wave B goes against the direction of waves A and C. It aims to correct the preceding wave and typically:
  - Consists of three sub-waves labeled as A, B, and C.
  - This wave tends to be a counter-trend movement within the larger correction.

### The Zigzag Correction

Among the many corrective patterns in the Elliott Wave Theory, the zigzag is the most common and straightforward 5-3-5 pattern. Here is a breakdown:
  - **Wave A**: An impulse wave consisting of five smaller waves.
  - **Wave B**: A corrective wave consisting of three smaller waves.
  - **Wave C**: Another impulse wave consisting of five smaller waves.

This pattern typically signifies that the market is correcting against the prior trend and can be identified in different degrees of trend, from monthly down to intraday charts.

### Rules and Guidelines

For accurate application of the Elliott Wave Principle and identification of the 5-3-5 structure, some rules and guidelines need to be observed:

1. **Wave A and Wave C should be in the same direction and should both follow the larger trend**.
   - The properties of these waves must resemble those of motive waves.
2. **Wave B should counter the trend of Wave A and Wave C**.
   - Wave B can unfold into various forms such as a flat, triangle, or another less common corrective structure.

### Criticism and Practical Considerations

Although widely used, the Elliott Wave Principle, including the 5-3-5 pattern, has faced criticism for being overly subjective. Identification of waves can be ambiguous, and different analysts may interpret the same market differently. Therefore, it requires a deep understanding of market conditions and a combination of other technical analysis tools.

## Conclusion

The 5-3-5 Elliott Wave pattern is a fundamental concept within the Elliott Wave Theory, embodying the principle of market cycles and fractal nature. By mastering the identification and characteristics of this pattern, traders can gain invaluable insights into market corrections and potential reversals, giving them an edge in forecasting future market movements.

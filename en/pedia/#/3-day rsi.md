# 3-Day RSI

The 3-Day Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements over a 3-day period. RSI oscillates between zero and 100 and is typically used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in a traded security. When applied to a 3-day time frame, it becomes a more short-term indicator compared to the more traditional 14-day RSI. This shorter duration can help traders take faster action in response to market events.

## Calculation of 3-Day RSI

The RSI is calculated using the following formula:

```
RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))

Where RS (Relative Strength) = Average Gain of last N periods / Average Loss of last N periods
```

For the 3-Day RSI, N is set to 3. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step calculation breakdown:

1. **Average Gain** - Sum of all the positive gains in the last 3 days divided by 3.
2. **Average Loss** - Sum of all the losses in the last 3 days divided by 3.
3. **Relative Strength (RS)** - The ratio of the average gain to the average loss.
4. **RSI Calculation** - Utilize the RSI formula to get the final value.

## Interpretation of 3-Day RSI

### Overbought and Oversold Conditions

Like its 14-day counterpart, the 3-day RSI can identify overbought or oversold conditions:

- **Overbought**: RSI above 70 typically indicates that the asset might be overbought and due for a price correction or a pullback.
- **Oversold**: RSI below 30 typically indicates that the asset might be oversold and due for a bounce or a rally.

### Divergence

Divergence occurs when the price of the security is moving in the opposite direction of the RSI. This can be a powerful signal that a reversal might be imminent. There are two types of divergence:

- **Bullish Divergence**: When the price makes a new low while the RSI makes a higher low, it may indicate an upcoming price increase.
- **Bearish Divergence**: When the price makes a new high while the RSI makes a lower high, it may signal an upcoming price decrease.

### RSI Trendlines

Just as price trendlines can be drawn on price charts, trendlines can also be drawn on the RSI. This technique can help identify potential reversals or continuations in the trend.

## Strategies Using 3-Day RSI

### RSI Crossover Strategy

One of the simplest strategies is the RSI crossover strategy where traders look for the RSI to cross above or below certain levels (typically 30 and 70) to make buy or sell decisions.

- **Buy Signal**: When the 3-day RSI crosses above 30, it may indicate a buying opportunity.
- **Sell Signal**: When the 3-day RSI crosses below 70, it may indicate a selling opportunity.

### RSI Swing Rejection

This strategy involves looking for RSI to re-enter a certain threshold:

- **Bullish Rejection**: RSI drops below 30 (indicating oversold), rallies back above 30, pulls back, but stays above 30, and then moves higher.
- **Bearish Rejection**: RSI rises above 70 (indicating overbought), drops back below 70, rallies back but stays below 70, and then moves lower.

### Combining with Other Indicators

The 3-Day RSI can be combined with other technical indicators like moving averages, MACD, or Bollinger Bands to create more robust trading strategies. For example, one might look for an RSI signal in combination with a moving average cross to confirm a trade.

## Limitations of 3-Day RSI

While the 3-Day RSI can be a useful tool, it is not without its limitations:

- **False Signals**: The shorter time frame makes it more sensitive to price movements, which can result in more false signals.
- **Lagging Indicator**: Like all RSI calculations, it is based on past price data and may lag behind the actual price movement.
- **Market Conditions**: It may not perform well in certain market conditions, such as during strong trends where the price can remain overbought or oversold for extended periods.

## Conclusion

The 3-Day RSI is a valuable tool for traders looking for a more responsive and shorter-term momentum indicator. By measuring the relative strength over a 3-day period, it can provide timely signals for potential entry and exit points. However, as with any indicator, it should be used in conjunction with other analysis techniques to confirm signals and mitigate the risk of false positives.

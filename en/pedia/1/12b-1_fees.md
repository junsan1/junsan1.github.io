# 12b-1 Fees

12b-1 fees are annual [marketing](../m/marketing.md) or [distribution](../d/distribution.md) fees on mutual funds. These fees, named after the SEC rule that permits them, are designed to cover the costs of promoting and distributing the [fund](../f/fund.md), including compensating brokers and other salespersons whom investors rely on for advice and recommendations. The rule, part of the [Investment Company Act of 1940](../i/investment_company_act_of_1940.md), has become a subject of controversy among investors and [industry](../i/industry.md) professionals due to its impact on [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md) costs and the potential for conflicts of [interest](../i/interest.md).

### Background

Introduced in 1980 under SEC Rule 12b-1, these fees were originally intended to help mutual funds attract new investors during a period of [industry](../i/industry.md) [stagnation](../s/stagnation.md). The idea was that charging current investors a small [fee](../f/fee.md) would help the [fund](../f/fund.md) grow by attracting new investors, ultimately benefiting everyone through [economies of scale](../e/economies_of_scale.md) and a larger [asset](../a/asset.md) base. However, over the decades, the justification for these fees has become less clear, and many argue they primarily serve as a way to continuously pay for [fund](../f/fund.md) [distribution](../d/distribution.md).

### Breakdown of 12b-1 Fees

12b-1 fees can include two primary components: 

1. **[Distribution](../d/distribution.md) Fees:** These are fees paid to brokers, advisors, or salespersons for selling the [fund](../f/fund.md) to new investors.
2. **Service Fees:** These fees are used to compensate brokers and others for ongoing account services provided to shareholders. 

A [fund](../f/fund.md) can charge up to 1% of its assets annually under the 12b-1 rule, which is divided into up to 0.75% for [distribution](../d/distribution.md) and 0.25% for servicing. It’s noteworthy that not all mutual funds charge 12b-1 fees; those that do must clearly outline these fees in the [fund](../f/fund.md)’s [prospectus](../p/prospectus.md).

### Impact on Investors

12b-1 fees directly impact the net returns that investors receive because they are deducted from the [fund](../f/fund.md)’s assets. This [deduction](../d/deduction.md) effectively reduces the overall growth of an [investor](../i/investor.md)'s [money](../m/money.md) in the [fund](../f/fund.md). These fees can particularly erode returns in [index](../i/index.md) funds or other investment vehicles where the management expenses should ideally be lower.

### Controversy and Criticism

The total amount of 12b-1 fees collected can be substantial, especially for popular funds with significant assets under management. Critics argue that these fees:

- Create a [conflict of interest](../c/conflict_of_interest.md) by incentivizing brokers to recommend funds with higher 12b-1 fees over lower-cost alternatives.
- Often do not provide a clear and tangible benefit to the investors who are paying them.
- Are outdated, given the shift towards more direct-investment platforms and away from traditional brokerage models.

### Regulation and Reforms

Criticisms of 12b-1 fees have led to discussions about regulatory reforms. The SEC has considered proposals to reform or even eliminate 12b-1 fees entirely. Advocates for reform argue that modern technology and [distribution](../d/distribution.md) methods have rendered the original justification for these fees obsolete.

### Practical Considerations for Investors

When selecting a [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md), investors should:

- Carefully review the [fund](../f/fund.md)’s [prospectus](../p/prospectus.md) to understand any 12b-1 fees being charged.
- Consider the overall [expense ratio](../e/expense_ratio.md) of the [fund](../f/fund.md), which usually includes the 12b-1 fees.
- Compare funds across different platforms to find those with lower or no 12b-1 fees.

### Current Examples and Alternatives

Several [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md) companies have chosen different approaches regarding 12b-1 fees:

- **[Fidelity Investments](../f/fidelity_investments.md)** [Fidelity Investments](https://www.fidelity.com): Fidelity offers many no-[load](../l/load.md) funds that do not charge 12b-1 fees.
- **Vanguard** [Vanguard](https://www.vanguard.com): Vanguard is known for its low-cost funds that typically avoid 12b-1 fees.
- **[Charles Schwab](../c/charles_schwab.md)** [Charles Schwab](https://www.schwab.com): Schwab provides a variety of low-cost mutual funds and ETFs that aim to minimize fees, including 12b-1 fees.

### Conclusion

12b-1 fees are a significant consideration in the cost structure of mutual funds. While designed to support [fund](../f/fund.md) growth and [distribution](../d/distribution.md), they have sparked considerable debate over their fairness and effectiveness. Investors need to be vigilant about understanding these fees and how they can impact their investment returns. As the financial landscape continues to evolve, ongoing scrutiny and potential regulatory changes may further shape the role of 12b-1 fees in the [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md) [industry](../i/industry.md).

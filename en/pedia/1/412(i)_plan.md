# 412(i) Plan

## Introduction
The 412(i) Plan is a type of defined benefit [pension plan](../p/pension_plan.md) specifically designed for small businesses. This retirement plan is governed by the rules of Section 412(i) of the Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Code. Unlike traditional defined benefit plans, which are funded based on an actuarial calculation, a 412(i) plan requires funding exclusively through fixed annuities or a combination of fixed annuities and [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) contracts. These contracts must be guaranteed by an [insurance](../i/insurance.md) company and meet other specific criteria to qualify under the 412(i) plan's provisions.

## Key Features of 412(i) Plans

### Guaranteed Return

One of the standout features of a 412(i) plan is the guarantee of [return](../r/return.md) on investment. Since the plan is funded through [insurance](../i/insurance.md) products with fixed returns, the employer knows exactly how much [will](../w/will.md) be paid out upon the employeeâ€™s retirement. This eliminates the investment [risk](../r/risk.md) typically associated with [retirement planning](../r/retirement_planning.md).

### Eligibility

A 412(i) plan is suited primarily for small [business](../b/business.md) owners, professionals (such as doctors, lawyers, and consultants), and companies with a small number of highly compensated employees. Generally, businesses that benefit most from a 412(i) plan have stable, predictable annual [earnings](../e/earnings.md) and want to provide a high level of retirement benefits to their key employees.

### Funding Requirements

The plan must be fully funded according to the premiums specified in the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) contracts. The [business](../b/business.md) owner must contribute the required premiums every year without [fail](../f/fail.md). Failure to meet these requirements can result in penalties and the loss of tax benefits.

### Tax Advantages

412(i) plans [offer](../o/offer.md) significant tax advantages. Employer contributions are tax-deductible, and the growth of the annuity within the plan grows [tax-deferred](../t/tax_deferred.md). Additionally, upon [distribution](../d/distribution.md), the benefits are typically taxed as [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md).

## Annuity and Life Insurance Requirements

For a retirement plan to qualify as a 412(i) plan, it must meet several stringent requirements:

- **Annuities:** All plan contributions must be used to purchase annuity contracts, which guarantee a specified retirement benefit.
- **[Life Insurance](../l/life_insurance.md):** The plan can include [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policies, but the [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) must be incidental to the primary purpose of providing retirement benefits.
- **Guaranteed Benefits:** The annuities and [insurance](../i/insurance.md) contracts must provide guaranteed benefits, with no provisions allowing for [market](../m/market.md) [variability](../v/variability.md) or employer discretion.

## Contribution Limits

A significant advantage of 412(i) plans is the high contribution limits compared to other retirement plans like 401(k)s or traditional defined benefit plans. The contribution limits are not predefined but are based on the amount necessary to purchase the annuities and [insurance](../i/insurance.md) required to [fund](../f/fund.md) the guaranteed retirement benefit.

## Vesting

The [vesting](../v/vesting.md) schedule for a 412(i) plan is often more flexible than other types of retirement plans. Businesses can design the [vesting](../v/vesting.md) schedule to meet both the needs of the company and its employees.

## Special Considerations

### Professional Advice

Setting up a 412(i) plan is more complex than other types of retirement plans. It usually requires the expertise of financial advisors, actuaries, and legal professionals to ensure the plan is compliant with IRS regulations and suits the [business](../b/business.md)'s needs.

### Regular Audits

Due to its complexity and the high level of contributions, a 412(i) plan may be subject to regular audits by the IRS or the Department of Labor. Employers should maintain meticulous records and ensure compliance with all regulations.

### Plan Termination

Terminating a 412(i) plan is also a complicated process. If the plan is terminated before the [maturity](../m/maturity.md) of the annuity contracts, there may be significant financial penalties and tax consequences.

## Companies Specializing in 412(i) Plans

While many financial institutions provide services to set up and manage 412(i) plans, a few companies specialize in this niche. Some of these companies include:

- [Northwestern Mutual](https://www.northwesternmutual.com): Provides comprehensive [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md) services, including 412(i) retirement plan setup and management.

## Conclusion

A 412(i) plan can be a powerful retirement and [tax planning](../t/tax_planning.md) tool for small [business](../b/business.md) owners and key employees. It offers guaranteed returns, significant tax advantages, and high contribution limits. However, its complexity requires careful planning and professional advice to ensure it meets all regulatory requirements and effectively serves the [business](../b/business.md)'s and employees' retirement goals.

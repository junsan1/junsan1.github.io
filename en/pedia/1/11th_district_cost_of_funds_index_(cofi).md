# 11th District Cost of Funds Index (COFI)

The 11th District Cost of Funds [Index](../i/index.md) (COFI) is a regional [economic indicator](../e/economic_indicator.md) that primarily affects the lending [economy](../e/economy.md), particularly in the western United States. This [index](../i/index.md) represents the [weighted average](../w/weighted_average.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) rates paid by savings institutions on deposits and advances. It's issued by the Federal [Home](../h/home.md) [Loan](../l/loan.md) [Bank](../b/bank.md) of San Francisco (FHLBSF). COFI is used extensively in the calculation of [interest](../i/interest.md) rates for adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), thereby influencing [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) payments for a significant number of households.

## Background and Definition

### What is COFI?
COFI stands for the 11th District Cost of Funds [Index](../i/index.md). It was developed to provide a standardized measure of the cost of funds for lending institutions within the 11th Federal [Home](../h/home.md) [Loan](../l/loan.md) [Bank](../b/bank.md) District. This district includes the states of Arizona, California, and Nevada. The [index](../i/index.md) is designed to reflect the [interest](../i/interest.md) costs incurred by these institutions on the funds they utilize for lending purposes.

### Origin of COFI
The [index](../i/index.md) was initiated by the Federal [Home](../h/home.md) [Loan](../l/loan.md) [Bank](../b/bank.md) of San Francisco in 1981. It was aimed at providing a regional [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) that would help in the standardized calculation of adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs). By [offering](../o/offering.md) a consistent and reliable measure, COFI aids financial institutions in the effective pricing of ARMs.

### Composition
COFI is calculated based on the [weighted average](../w/weighted_average.md) of [interest](../i/interest.md) rates paid by member financial institutions on various categories of deposits and borrowings. This includes:
- Savings deposits
- Time deposits
- Advances from the Federal [Home](../h/home.md) [Loan](../l/loan.md) [Bank](../b/bank.md)
- Other borrowings

These components reflect the [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md) for a blend of funds, providing a comprehensive picture of funding costs for the institutions involved.

## Methodology

### Data Collection
The data used to calculate COFI is derived from monthly reports submitted by savings institutions to the Federal [Home](../h/home.md) [Loan](../l/loan.md) [Bank](../b/bank.md) of San Francisco. These institutions report the actual [interest](../i/interest.md) expenses incurred on their deposits, as well as other [interest](../i/interest.md)-bearing liabilities.

### Weighting
Each type of [deposit](../d/deposit.md) or borrowing is [weighted](../w/weighted.md) according to its percentage share of the total funds. For instance, if savings deposits constitute 50% of the total funds, then the [interest](../i/interest.md) paid on savings deposits [will](../w/will.md) account for half of the [index](../i/index.md) calculation.

### Calculation
The [index](../i/index.md) is calculated monthly and released approximately 30 days after the end of the reporting period. The formula for calculating COFI can be simplified as:

\[ \text{COFI} = \frac{\sum(\text{[Interest Expense](../i/interest_expense.md)}_i \times \text{Weight}_i)}{\sum \text{Total Funds}} \]

where:
- \( \text{[Interest Expense](../i/interest_expense.md)}_i \) is the total [interest](../i/interest.md) paid on a particular category of funds
- \( \text{Weight}_i \) is the proportion of that category in the total funds

This calculation ensures that the [index](../i/index.md) accurately reflects the [weighted average](../w/weighted_average.md) cost of funds.

## Applications

### Adjustable-Rate Mortgages (ARMs)
One of the primary applications of COFI is in the adjustment of [interest](../i/interest.md) rates for adjustable-rate mortgages. In these [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) contracts, the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) is periodically adjusted based on the [value](../v/value.md) of a specific [index](../i/index.md), commonly COFI. [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) lenders use COFI to adjust the [interest](../i/interest.md) rates on loans, which subsequently impacts the monthly [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) payments of borrowers.

### Financial Institutions
Financial institutions use COFI to evaluate their own cost structures and to [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) against other institutions. By analyzing COFI trends, banks and savings institutions can make informed decisions about their [loan](../l/loan.md) pricing, [deposit](../d/deposit.md) rates, and overall financial strategies.

### Economic Indicators
COFI is also a valuable [economic indicator](../e/economic_indicator.md) that reflects the broader trends in the cost of funds within the 11th District. [Market](../m/market.md) analysts and economists closely watch COFI as it can provide insights into the health of the lending [market](../m/market.md), and by extension, the [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) [market](../m/market.md) in the region.

## Impact and Reliability

### Regional Influence
COFI primarily influences financial activities within the 11th Federal [Home](../h/home.md) [Loan](../l/loan.md) [Bank](../b/bank.md) District. However, due to its role in [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) pricing, its effects can be seen beyond these borders, especially in cases where lenders operate nationwide but base their [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) products on COFI.

### Reliability and Stability
One of the strengths of COFI is its reliability and stability. It tends to be less volatile compared to other indices like the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). This stability makes COFI particularly appealing for long-term financial products such as mortgages.

### Criticisms
Despite its benefits, COFI is not without criticism. Some argue that it may not fully capture rapid changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates due to its method of averaging over various types of funds. Consequently, it may lag in reflecting the immediate cost conditions faced by lending institutions.

## Recent Trends

### Historical Performance
COFI has shown various trends over the years, often reflecting broader economic scenarios such as [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rates, [Federal Reserve policies](../f/federal_reserve_policies.md), and regional [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md). During periods of rising [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, COFI tends to increase, leading to higher [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) rates for borrowers.

### Current Trends
As of recent years, COFI has been influenced by the overall low-[interest](../i/interest.md)-rate environment, largely stemming from [Federal Reserve policies](../f/federal_reserve_policies.md) aimed at stimulating the [economy](../e/economy.md). This has resulted in relatively low COFI values, which has benefited borrowers with adjustable-rate mortgages tied to COFI.

### Future Outlook
Looking ahead, the future trajectory of COFI [will](../w/will.md) likely be influenced by macroeconomic policies, particularly those enacted by the Federal Reserve. Changes in [inflation](../i/inflation.md) expectations, [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md), and [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) [will](../w/will.md) all play a crucial role in determining COFI's direction.

## Conclusion

The 11th District Cost of Funds [Index](../i/index.md) (COFI) is a critical tool in the [financial sector](../f/financial_sector.md), particularly within the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [market](../m/market.md). By providing a standardized measure of the costs incurred by savings institutions on their deposits and borrowings, COFI plays a vital role in the pricing of adjustable-rate mortgages. Its influence extends to both financial institutions and borrowers, making it a significant [economic indicator](../e/economic_indicator.md) in the western United States.

Detailed understanding and monitoring of COFI are essential for stakeholders in the [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) and [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). As [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md) evolve, COFI [will](../w/will.md) continue to serve as a vital [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) in assessing and managing financial costs and risks.

# 3-Year Treasury Note

A 3-Year Treasury Note (T-Note) is a debt security issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury that has a maturity of three years. Investors purchase these notes at auction or on the secondary market, and they pay interest every six months until the note matures. At maturity, the investor is paid the face value of the note. Treasury notes are popular for their liquidity, safety, and the semiannual interest payments they provide.

## Characteristics of the 3-Year Treasury Note

### Interest Payments

The 3-Year Treasury Note pays interest, known as the coupon, semiannually. The coupon rate is established at the auction, determined by competitive bidding, and remains fixed throughout the life of the note.

### Maturity

The 3-Year Treasury Note has a fixed maturity of three years from the date of issuance. At the end of this period, the face value, also referred to as the principal, is returned to the investor.

### Issuance

3-Year Treasury Notes are issued regularly through the Treasury Auction system. The Treasury Department holds a public auction where institutions and individuals can submit bids. There are two types of bids: competitive and non-competitive. Competitive bidders specify the yield they are willing to accept, and non-competitive bidders accept the yield determined at auction.

### Secondary Market Trading

Although 3-Year Treasury Notes can be purchased directly from Treasury auctions, they are also actively traded on the secondary market. This secondary market ensures liquidity, allowing investors to buy and sell these notes before they mature.

### Safety and Credit Quality

Like all U.S. Treasury securities, the 3-Year Treasury Note is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, making it one of the safest investment vehicles available. This high level of safety is reflected in its credit rating, which is typically AAA, the highest rating assigned by credit rating agencies.

## How to Purchase 3-Year Treasury Notes

### TreasuryDirect

Investors can purchase 3-Year Treasury Notes directly through the U.S. Treasury’s online platform, TreasuryDirect. TreasuryDirect allows investors to buy, manage, and redeem U.S. government securities online.

### Financial Institutions

Brokerage firms and banks also facilitate the purchase of 3-Year Treasury Notes. These institutions buy notes at auction and sell them to individual investors, often charging a commission for their services.

### Secondary Market

As previously mentioned, 3-Year Treasury Notes can also be purchased on the secondary market, where they trade similarly to other fixed-income securities.

## Yield and Price

### Yield

The yield on a 3-Year Treasury Note represents the return an investor can expect to earn if the note is held until maturity. It is expressed as an annual percentage rate. The yield is influenced by factors such as:

- **Supply and Demand:** Fluctuations in the supply of and demand for Treasury Notes affect their yield.
- **Inflation:** Expectations of inflation often influence interest rates, with higher inflation expectations leading to higher yields.
- **Monetary Policy:** The Federal Reserve's policy decisions, such as changes to the federal funds rate, directly affect Treasury yields.
- **Economic Conditions:** The overall economic environment, including factors like GDP growth and employment levels, impacts investor sentiment and, consequently, yields.

### Price

The price of a 3-Year Treasury Note can fluctuate due to changes in interest rates and other market conditions. When interest rates rise, the price of existing notes typically falls, and vice versa. The note can trade at a premium (above face value) or at a discount (below face value) depending on the prevailing market interest rates relative to the note’s coupon rate.

## Importance for Investors

Treasury Notes, including the 3-Year variant, are essential components of a diversified investment portfolio for several reasons:

### Risk Management

Given their low default risk, Treasury Notes serve as a safe haven during periods of economic [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) and market volatility. They can help mitigate the risks associated with more volatile assets like stocks.

### Regular Income

The semiannual interest payments provide a predictable income stream, which can be particularly appealing for retirees or those seeking steady cash flow.

### Capital Preservation

With direct backing by the U.S. government, the principal invested in 3-Year Treasury Notes is secure, provided the investor holds the notes to maturity.

### Diversification

Incorporating Treasury Notes into a broader portfolio adds diversification, helping manage risk and balance more aggressive investments.

## Comparison with Other Treasury Securities

### Treasury Bills (T-Bills)

Treasury Bills are short-term securities with maturities ranging from a few days to one year. Unlike Treasury Notes, they do not pay periodic interest but are sold at a discount to their face value, with the investor receiving the full face value at maturity. T-Bills are suitable for those needing shorter-term investment options.

### Treasury Bonds (T-Bonds)

Treasury Bonds have longer maturities, typically ranging from 20 to 30 years. They also pay interest semiannually but are more susceptible to interest rate risk due to their longer duration. T-Bonds are suitable for investors seeking long-term investment opportunities with higher yields compared to shorter-term securities.

### Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)

TIPS are similar to Treasury Notes and Bonds but with an added feature: their principal value adjusts based on changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). This characteristic provides protection against inflation. TIPS are suitable for investors looking to maintain purchasing power in inflationary environments.

### Floating Rate Notes (FRNs)

FRNs are securities with interest payments that adjust based on changes in a specified short-term interest rate, typically the 13-week Treasury Bill rate. This floating rate feature helps reduce interest rate risk.

## Tax Treatment

Interest income from 3-Year Treasury Notes is subject to federal income tax but exempt from state and local taxes. This favorable tax treatment makes them attractive for investors in states with high income tax rates.

## Role in Monetary Policy and Economic Indicators

The yield on the 3-Year Treasury Note is monitored closely by economists and analysts as an economic indicator. It often reflects expectations for future interest rates, inflation, and overall economic conditions.

### Yield Curve

The 3-Year Treasury Note is a part of the U.S. Treasury [yield curve](../y/yield_curve.md), which plots the yields of Treasury securities across different maturities. The shape of the [yield curve](../y/yield_curve.md) is a critical economic indicator. For example, an inverted [yield curve](../y/yield_curve.md), where short-term yields are higher than long-term yields, can signal an upcoming recession.

### Monetary Policy Implications

The Federal Reserve monitors Treasury yields when making policy decisions. Changes in the yield on the 3-Year Treasury Note can influence the Fed’s decisions regarding interest rate changes and other monetary policy tools.

## Conclusion

The 3-Year Treasury Note is a vital instrument in the U.S. fixed-income market. It offers a blend of safety, liquidity, and periodic income, appealing to a wide range of investors. Its role as an economic indicator and its influence on monetary policy further highlight its importance in the financial landscape.

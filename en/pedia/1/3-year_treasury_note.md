# 3-Year Treasury Note

A 3-Year Treasury [Note](../n/note.md) (T-[Note](../n/note.md)) is a [debt security](../d/debt_security.md) issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury that has a [maturity](../m/maturity.md) of three years. Investors purchase these notes at auction or on the [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md), and they pay [interest](../i/interest.md) every six months until the [note](../n/note.md) matures. At [maturity](../m/maturity.md), the [investor](../i/investor.md) is paid the [face value](../f/face_value.md) of the [note](../n/note.md). [Treasury notes](../t/treasury_notes.md) are popular for their [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), safety, and the semiannual [interest](../i/interest.md) payments they provide.

## Characteristics of the 3-Year Treasury Note

### Interest Payments

The 3-Year Treasury [Note](../n/note.md) pays [interest](../i/interest.md), known as the coupon, semiannually. The [coupon rate](../c/coupon_rate.md) is established at the auction, determined by competitive bidding, and remains fixed throughout the life of the [note](../n/note.md).

### Maturity

The 3-Year Treasury [Note](../n/note.md) has a fixed [maturity](../m/maturity.md) of three years from the date of issuance. At the end of this period, the [face value](../f/face_value.md), also referred to as the [principal](../p/principal.md), is returned to the [investor](../i/investor.md).

### Issuance

3-Year [Treasury Notes](../t/treasury_notes.md) are issued regularly through the Treasury Auction system. The Treasury Department holds a public auction where institutions and individuals can submit bids. There are two types of bids: competitive and non-competitive. Competitive bidders specify the [yield](../y/yield.md) they are willing to accept, and non-competitive bidders accept the [yield](../y/yield.md) determined at auction.

### Secondary Market Trading

Although 3-Year [Treasury Notes](../t/treasury_notes.md) can be purchased directly from Treasury auctions, they are also actively traded on the [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md). This [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md) ensures [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), allowing investors to buy and sell these notes before they mature.

### Safety and Credit Quality

Like all [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) securities, the 3-Year Treasury [Note](../n/note.md) is backed by the full faith and [credit](../c/credit.md) of the U.S. government, making it one of the safest investment vehicles available. This high level of safety is reflected in its [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md), which is typically [AAA](../a/aaa.md), the highest [rating](../r/rating.md) assigned by [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) agencies.

## How to Purchase 3-Year Treasury Notes

### TreasuryDirect

Investors can purchase 3-Year [Treasury Notes](../t/treasury_notes.md) directly through the [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md)’s online platform, TreasuryDirect. TreasuryDirect allows investors to buy, manage, and redeem U.S. government securities online.

### Financial Institutions

Brokerage firms and banks also facilitate the purchase of 3-Year [Treasury Notes](../t/treasury_notes.md). These institutions buy notes at auction and sell them to individual investors, often charging a [commission](../c/commission.md) for their services.

### Secondary Market

As previously mentioned, 3-Year [Treasury Notes](../t/treasury_notes.md) can also be purchased on the [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md), where they [trade](../t/trade.md) similarly to other fixed-[income](../i/income.md) securities.

## Yield and Price

### Yield

The [yield](../y/yield.md) on a 3-Year Treasury [Note](../n/note.md) represents the [return](../r/return.md) an [investor](../i/investor.md) can expect to earn if the [note](../n/note.md) is held until [maturity](../m/maturity.md). It is expressed as an annual percentage rate. The [yield](../y/yield.md) is influenced by factors such as:

- **[Supply](../s/supply.md) and [Demand](../d/demand.md):** Fluctuations in the [supply](../s/supply.md) of and [demand](../d/demand.md) for [Treasury Notes](../t/treasury_notes.md) affect their [yield](../y/yield.md).
- **[Inflation](../i/inflation.md):** Expectations of [inflation](../i/inflation.md) often influence [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, with higher [inflation](../i/inflation.md) expectations leading to higher yields.
- **[Monetary Policy](../m/monetary_policy.md):** The Federal Reserve's policy decisions, such as changes to the [federal funds rate](../f/federal_funds_rate.md), directly affect Treasury yields.
- **[Economic Conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md):** The overall economic environment, including factors like GDP growth and employment levels, impacts [investor](../i/investor.md) sentiment and, consequently, yields.

### Price

The price of a 3-Year Treasury [Note](../n/note.md) can fluctuate due to changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and other [market](../m/market.md) conditions. When [interest](../i/interest.md) rates rise, the price of existing notes typically falls, and vice versa. The [note](../n/note.md) can [trade](../t/trade.md) at a [premium](../p/premium.md) (above [face value](../f/face_value.md)) or at a [discount](../d/discount.md) (below [face value](../f/face_value.md)) depending on the prevailing [market](../m/market.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) rates relative to the [note](../n/note.md)’s [coupon rate](../c/coupon_rate.md).

## Importance for Investors

[Treasury Notes](../t/treasury_notes.md), including the 3-Year variant, are essential components of a diversified investment portfolio for several reasons:

### Risk Management

Given their low [default risk](../d/default_risk.md), [Treasury Notes](../t/treasury_notes.md) serve as a [safe haven](../s/safe_haven.md) during periods of economic [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) and [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md). They can help mitigate the risks associated with more volatile assets like [stocks](../s/stock.md).

### Regular Income

The semiannual [interest](../i/interest.md) payments provide a predictable [income](../i/income.md) stream, which can be particularly appealing for retirees or those seeking steady [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md).

### Capital Preservation

With direct backing by the U.S. government, the [principal](../p/principal.md) invested in 3-Year [Treasury Notes](../t/treasury_notes.md) is secure, provided the [investor](../i/investor.md) holds the notes to [maturity](../m/maturity.md).

### Diversification

Incorporating [Treasury Notes](../t/treasury_notes.md) into a broader portfolio adds [diversification](../d/diversification.md), helping manage [risk](../r/risk.md) and balance more aggressive investments.

## Comparison with Other Treasury Securities

### Treasury Bills (T-Bills)

Treasury Bills are short-term securities with maturities ranging from a few days to one year. Unlike [Treasury Notes](../t/treasury_notes.md), they do not pay periodic [interest](../i/interest.md) but are sold at a [discount](../d/discount.md) to their [face value](../f/face_value.md), with the [investor](../i/investor.md) receiving the full [face value](../f/face_value.md) at [maturity](../m/maturity.md). T-Bills are suitable for those needing shorter-term investment [options](../o/options.md).

### Treasury Bonds (T-Bonds)

Treasury Bonds have longer maturities, typically ranging from 20 to 30 years. They also pay [interest](../i/interest.md) semiannually but are more susceptible to [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md) due to their longer [duration](../d/duration.md). T-Bonds are suitable for investors seeking long-term investment opportunities with higher yields compared to shorter-term securities.

### Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)

TIPS are similar to [Treasury Notes](../t/treasury_notes.md) and Bonds but with an added feature: their [principal](../p/principal.md) [value](../v/value.md) adjusts based on changes in the Consumer Price [Index](../i/index.md) (CPI). This characteristic provides protection against [inflation](../i/inflation.md). TIPS are suitable for investors looking to maintain [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) in inflationary environments.

### Floating Rate Notes (FRNs)

FRNs are securities with [interest](../i/interest.md) payments that adjust based on changes in a specified short-term [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md), typically the 13-week Treasury Bill rate. This floating rate feature helps reduce [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md).

## Tax Treatment

[Interest](../i/interest.md) [income](../i/income.md) from 3-Year [Treasury Notes](../t/treasury_notes.md) is subject to [federal income](../f/federal_income.md) tax but exempt from state and local [taxes](../t/taxes.md). This favorable tax treatment makes them attractive for investors in states with high [income tax](../i/income_tax.md) rates.

## Role in Monetary Policy and Economic Indicators

The [yield](../y/yield.md) on the 3-Year Treasury [Note](../n/note.md) is monitored closely by economists and analysts as an [economic indicator](../e/economic_indicator.md). It often reflects expectations for future [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, [inflation](../i/inflation.md), and overall [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md).

### Yield Curve

The 3-Year Treasury [Note](../n/note.md) is a part of the [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) [yield curve](../y/yield_curve.md), which plots the yields of Treasury securities across different maturities. The shape of the [yield curve](../y/yield_curve.md) is a critical [economic indicator](../e/economic_indicator.md). For example, an inverted [yield curve](../y/yield_curve.md), where short-term yields are higher than long-term yields, can signal an upcoming [recession](../r/recession.md).

### Monetary Policy Implications

The Federal Reserve monitors Treasury yields when making policy decisions. Changes in the [yield](../y/yield.md) on the 3-Year Treasury [Note](../n/note.md) can influence the Fed’s decisions regarding [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) changes and other [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) tools.

## Conclusion

The 3-Year Treasury [Note](../n/note.md) is a vital instrument in the U.S. fixed-[income](../i/income.md) [market](../m/market.md). It offers a blend of safety, [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), and periodic [income](../i/income.md), appealing to a wide [range](../r/range.md) of investors. Its role as an [economic indicator](../e/economic_indicator.md) and its influence on [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) further highlight its importance in the financial landscape.

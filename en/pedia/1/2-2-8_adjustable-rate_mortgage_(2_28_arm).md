# 2-2-8 Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (2/28 ARM)

A 2-2-8 Adjustable-Rate [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) (ARM), often known as a 2/28 ARM, is a type of [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) that combines aspects of both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages. It is structured in a way that provides initial [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) stability followed by periodic adjustments that reflect prevailing [market](../m/market.md) conditions. This [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) product is appealing for certain types of borrowers who expect to either sell the property or [refinance](../r/refinance.md) before the adjustable rate period begins. To fully understand how a 2/28 ARM works, it's essential to dive into the specifics of its structure, benefits, risks, and scenarios where it might be advantageous or disadvantageous for borrowers.

## Structure and Terms

A 2/28 ARM typically consists of two distinct phases:

1. **Initial Fixed-Rate Period (2 years):** For the first two years of the [loan](../l/loan.md), the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) is fixed. This means that the monthly payments remain constant regardless of changes in broader [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

2. **Adjustable-Rate Period (28 years):** Following the initial fixed period, the [loan](../l/loan.md) transitions into an adjustable-rate [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) for the remaining 28 years. During this phase, the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) can change periodically based on the terms specified in the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) agreement, usually aligning with a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md) plus a [margin](../m/margin.md).

### Benchmark Index and Margin

The adjustable-rate portion of the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) is typically indexed to a financial [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md), such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or the 11th District Cost of Funds [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (COFI). The specific rate the borrower pays is calculated as the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) rate plus a [margin](../m/margin.md). For example, if the agreed [margin](../m/margin.md) is 2% and the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) rate is currently at 3%, the borrower's new [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) for that period would be 5%.

## Mechanics of the Adjustment

The [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) adjustments usually occur annually, although the frequency can vary. Each adjustment is capped to protect the borrower from dramatic increases. Commonly, there are caps on how much the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) can increase during each adjustment period and over the life of the [loan](../l/loan.md), known as periodic and lifetime caps, respectively.

### Periodic Cap

A periodic cap limits the amount the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) can increase from one adjustment period to the next. For instance, if an ARM has a 2% periodic cap, and the current rate is 5%, the new rate cannot exceed 7% even if the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md) rises sharply.

### Lifetime Cap

A lifetime cap limits the total increase over the life of the [loan](../l/loan.md). If a [loan](../l/loan.md) has a 5% lifetime cap starting from an initial rate of 4%, the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) can never exceed 9%, regardless of how high the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md) moves.

## Benefits of a 2/28 ARM

### Lower Initial Payments

One of the primary advantages of a 2/28 ARM is the lower initial [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) compared to a traditional [fixed-rate mortgage](../f/fixed-rate_mortgage.md). This can make the monthly payments more affordable during the initial two-year fixed period, which may be beneficial for borrowers expecting a rise in [income](../i/income.md) or planning to sell or [refinance](../r/refinance.md) the property before the adjustable period takes effect.

### Potential to Qualify for a Larger Loan

The lower initial payments can also enable borrowers to qualify for a larger [loan](../l/loan.md) amount than they might with a [fixed-rate mortgage](../f/fixed-rate_mortgage.md), because the initial lower payments make the [debt](../d/debt.md)-to-[income](../i/income.md) ratio more favorable.

### Flexibility for Long-Term Plans

A 2/28 ARM can be a strategic choice for individuals who have a clear plan regarding their housing situation, such as those who anticipate relocating within a few years or who plan to [refinance](../r/refinance.md) before the initial fixed-rate period ends.

## Risks and Considerations

### Payment Shock

One of the significant risks of a 2/28 ARM is the potential for [payment](../p/payment.md) shock. Borrowers need to be prepared for the possibility that their payments could increase substantially once the [loan](../l/loan.md) transitions to the adjustable-rate period. If the [interest](../i/interest.md) rates have risen significantly, the adjustment can lead to much higher monthly payments, which can be challenging for borrowers who have not adequately prepared.

### Uncertainty

The adjustable-rate nature of the [loan](../l/loan.md) introduces an element of [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md). Predicting future [interest](../i/interest.md) rates is inherently difficult, and [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md) can lead to rates climbing higher than initially anticipated, leading to higher costs over the life of the [loan](../l/loan.md).

### Need for Contingency Plans

Given the potential risks, borrowers considering a 2/28 ARM should have [contingency](../c/contingency.md) plans. For example, they should be prepared to [refinance](../r/refinance.md) into a fixed-rate [loan](../l/loan.md) if [interest](../i/interest.md) rates appear to be on the rise as the adjustable period approaches. This requires maintaining [good credit](../g/good_credit.md) and potentially dealing with the cost of refinancing.

## Comparison to Other Mortgage Products

### Fixed-Rate Mortgage

A [fixed-rate mortgage](../f/fixed-rate_mortgage.md) keeps the same [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) for the entire term of the [loan](../l/loan.md), [offering](../o/offering.md) stability and predictability in monthly payments. This can be advantageous for borrowers who [value](../v/value.md) long-term stability and plan to stay in their [home](../h/home.md) for an extended period. 

### Other ARM Products

Other ARMs, such as the 5/1 ARM, which has a fixed rate for the first five years followed by annual adjustments, might provide better initial [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) stability for a longer period compared to a 2/28 ARM. However, borrowers must weigh this against their specific financial situation and expectations about future [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) movements.

## Suitability and Scenarios

The suitability of a 2/28 ARM depends largely on an individualâ€™s financial situation, goals, [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md), and expectations about future [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. Here are scenarios where a 2/28 ARM might be particularly advantageous or disadvantageous:

### Advantageous Scenarios

- **Short-term Homeownership Plans:** If a borrower plans to sell the property within the initial fixed-rate period, they can benefit from the lower initial [interest](../i/interest.md) rates without ever facing the [risk](../r/risk.md) of rate adjustments.
- **Anticipated [Income](../i/income.md) Growth:** Borrowers expecting a significant increase in [income](../i/income.md) might be willing to accept the [risk](../r/risk.md) of future rate adjustments, knowing they [will](../w/will.md) be better positioned to [handle](../h/handle.md) higher payments.
- **Refinancing Plans:** If the borrower intends to [refinance](../r/refinance.md) before the adjustable-rate period begins, the initial lower rate can be beneficial, provided they have a clear strategy for refinancing.

### Disadvantageous Scenarios

- **Long-term Ownership with Uncertain [Income](../i/income.md):** Borrowers who plan to remain in the [home](../h/home.md) long-term but are uncertain about future [income](../i/income.md) increases may find the potential for increased payments unsettling.
- **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Aversion:** Individuals who prefer the predictability of fixed payments and are uncomfortable with [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) fluctuations may find a 2/28 ARM too risky.

## Conclusion

A 2/28 ARM can be a viable option for certain borrowers, particularly those who have clear, short-term plans for their homeownership or strong expectations of [income](../i/income.md) growth and refinancing opportunities. The lower initial [interest](../i/interest.md) rates make the [loan](../l/loan.md) more affordable in the short term, but the transition to adjustable rates introduces potential for significant [payment](../p/payment.md) increases. Therefore, it is crucial for borrowers to carefully assess their financial situation, future plans, and [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) before committing to a 2/28 ARM. Understanding the mechanics of the [loan](../l/loan.md), including the terms of adjustments, caps, and the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md), is key to making an informed decision.

# 5-Year Treasury Note

The 5-Year Treasury [Note](../n/note.md) (T-[Note](../n/note.md)) is a [debt security](../d/debt_security.md) issued by the United States Department of the Treasury that matures in five years. It is a part of the broader spectrum of [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) securities which include Treasury bills, [Treasury notes](../t/treasury_notes.md), and Treasury bonds. These securities are used to [finance](../f/finance.md) the public [debt](../d/debt.md) and regulate the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md).

## Characteristics of the 5-Year Treasury Note

### Interest and Yield
The 5-Year Treasury [Note](../n/note.md) pays [interest](../i/interest.md) every six months until [maturity](../m/maturity.md). The [yield](../y/yield.md) on the T-[Note](../n/note.md) is the [return](../r/return.md) investors can expect if they [hold](../h/hold.md) it until [maturity](../m/maturity.md), and is generally considered a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for other [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. The [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md), or [coupon rate](../c/coupon_rate.md), is determined at auction and remains fixed throughout the life of the [note](../n/note.md).

### Auctions
The [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) issues new 5-Year T-Notes through auctions, which can be either competitive or non-competitive:
- **Non-Competitive Bidding**: In a non-competitive auction, investors agree to accept the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) determined at auction. This type of bidding is often used by individual investors.
- **Competitive Bidding**: In a competitive auction, investors specify the [yield](../y/yield.md) they are willing to accept. Competitive bidders include large financial institutions, mutual funds, and foreign governments.

### Secondary Market
After the initial issuance, 5-Year T-Notes can be bought and sold in the [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md). This provides [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) to investors who may need to sell their notes before [maturity](../m/maturity.md). Prices in the [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md) fluctuate based on changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, [inflation](../i/inflation.md) expectations, and overall [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md).

## Role in the Economy

### Benchmark Rates
The 5-Year Treasury [Note](../n/note.md) serves as an important [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). Its [yield](../y/yield.md) is often used as a [reference rate](../r/reference_rate.md) for various types of loans and fixed-[income](../i/income.md) securities, including mortgages, corporate bonds, and [municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md). Movements in the 5-Year T-[Note](../n/note.md) [yield](../y/yield.md) can signal [investor](../i/investor.md) sentiment about future [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md).

### Monetary Policy
The Federal Reserve monitors the yields on Treasury securities, including the 5-Year T-[Note](../n/note.md), as part of its [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) operations. Changes in the [yield curve](../y/yield_curve.md)—the plot of yields across different maturities of Treasury securities—can indicate future economic prospects and influence Federal Reserve decisions on [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

## Investment Considerations

### Safety and Risk
5-Year [Treasury Notes](../t/treasury_notes.md) are considered one of the safest investments because they are backed by the full faith and [credit](../c/credit.md) of the U.S. government. The primary [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with 5-Year T-Notes is [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md). If [interest](../i/interest.md) rates rise after purchase, the [market value](../m/market_value.md) of the [note](../n/note.md) may decline.

### Inflation Protection
The [return](../r/return.md) on a 5-Year T-[Note](../n/note.md) can be eroded by [inflation](../i/inflation.md). To mitigate this [risk](../r/risk.md), investors can consider Treasury [Inflation-Protected Securities](../i/inflation-protected_securities.md) (TIPS), which adjust their [principal](../p/principal.md) [value](../v/value.md) based on changes in the Consumer Price [Index](../i/index.md) (CPI).

## Historical Performance
### Yield Trends
[Yield](../y/yield.md) on the 5-Year Treasury [Note](../n/note.md) has varied considerably over time, influenced by [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md), Federal Reserve policy, and global events. Historical data on yields can provide insight into how these factors impact short to intermediate-term [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

### Notable Periods
- **The 1980s**: A period of high [inflation](../i/inflation.md) and high-[interest](../i/interest.md) rates when the [yield](../y/yield.md) on the 5-Year T-[Note](../n/note.md) reached double digits.
- **[Financial Crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) of 2007-2008**: Yields fell sharply as investors sought the safety of [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) securities.
- **COVID-19 Pandemic**: Yields dropped to near historic lows as the Federal Reserve cut [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and implemented [quantitative easing](../q/quantitative_easing.md) measures.

## Conclusion
The 5-Year Treasury [Note](../n/note.md) is a fundamental component of the U.S. [financial system](../f/financial_system.md), serving as a safe investment option and an important [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for other [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. Its [yield](../y/yield.md) reflects [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md) and [investor](../i/investor.md) expectations, making it a critical [indicator](../i/indicator.md) for policymakers and [market](../m/market.md) participants alike.

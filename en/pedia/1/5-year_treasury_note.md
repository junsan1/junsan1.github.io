# 5-Year Treasury Note

The 5-Year Treasury Note (T-Note) is a debt security issued by the United States Department of the Treasury that matures in five years. It is a part of the broader spectrum of U.S. Treasury securities which include Treasury bills, Treasury notes, and Treasury bonds. These securities are used to finance the public debt and regulate the money supply.

## Characteristics of the 5-Year Treasury Note

### Interest and Yield
The 5-Year Treasury Note pays interest every six months until maturity. The yield on the T-Note is the return investors can expect if they hold it until maturity, and is generally considered a benchmark for other interest rates. The interest rate, or coupon rate, is determined at auction and remains fixed throughout the life of the note.

### Auctions
The U.S. Treasury issues new 5-Year T-Notes through auctions, which can be either competitive or non-competitive:
- **Non-Competitive Bidding**: In a non-competitive auction, investors agree to accept the interest rate determined at auction. This type of bidding is often used by individual investors.
- **Competitive Bidding**: In a competitive auction, investors specify the yield they are willing to accept. Competitive bidders include large financial institutions, mutual funds, and foreign governments.

### Secondary Market
After the initial issuance, 5-Year T-Notes can be bought and sold in the secondary market. This provides liquidity to investors who may need to sell their notes before maturity. Prices in the secondary market fluctuate based on changes in interest rates, inflation expectations, and overall economic conditions.

## Role in the Economy

### Benchmark Rates
The 5-Year Treasury Note serves as an important benchmark for financial markets. Its yield is often used as a reference rate for various types of loans and fixed-income securities, including mortgages, corporate bonds, and [municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md). Movements in the 5-Year T-Note yield can signal investor sentiment about future interest rates and economic growth.

### Monetary Policy
The Federal Reserve monitors the yields on Treasury securities, including the 5-Year T-Note, as part of its monetary policy operations. Changes in the [yield curve](../y/yield_curve.md)—the plot of yields across different maturities of Treasury securities—can indicate future economic prospects and influence Federal Reserve decisions on interest rates.

## Investment Considerations

### Safety and Risk
5-Year Treasury Notes are considered one of the safest investments because they are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. The primary risk associated with 5-Year T-Notes is interest rate risk. If interest rates rise after purchase, the market value of the note may decline.

### Inflation Protection
The return on a 5-Year T-Note can be eroded by inflation. To mitigate this risk, investors can consider Treasury [Inflation-Protected Securities](../i/inflation-protected_securities.md) (TIPS), which adjust their principal value based on changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

## Historical Performance

# 83(b) Election

The 83(b) election is a [provision](../p/provision.md) of the Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Code (IRC) that gives an employee or [startup](../s/startup.md) founder the option to pay [taxes](../t/taxes.md) on the total fair [market value](../m/market_value.md) of [restricted stock](../r/restricted_stock.md) at the time of granting, as opposed to the time of [vesting](../v/vesting.md). Named after Section 83(b) of the IRC, this election can significantly affect the tax [obligations](../o/obligation.md) of individuals who receive [equity compensation](../e/equity_compensation.md). Understanding the 83(b) election is crucial for those involved in startups or early-stage companies, where [equity](../e/equity.md) is often a key component of compensation packages.

## What is the 83(b) Election?

Under typical circumstances, when an employee receives [restricted stock](../r/restricted_stock.md), they are taxed as the stock vests. The [value](../v/value.md) of the stock is considered [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md), and it is taxed at the current fair [market value](../m/market_value.md). However, with an 83(b) election, the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) can choose to be taxed on the [value](../v/value.md) of the stock at the time it is granted, even if it has not yet vested.

### The Importance of Fair Market Value

The fair [market value](../m/market_value.md) (FMV) plays a central role in the 83(b) election. The FMV is the price that the stock would sell for on the [open market](../o/open_market.md). By paying [taxes](../t/taxes.md) on the FMV at the time of [grant](../g/grant.md), an individual can potentially save [money](../m/money.md) if the company’s stock appreciates significantly before it vests. The main objective is to lock in the current lower [value](../v/value.md) for tax purposes, in the hope that the stock [will](../w/will.md) increase in [value](../v/value.md) by the time it vests, thus avoiding higher [taxes](../t/taxes.md) later.

## How Does the 83(b) Election Work?

### Steps to File an 83(b) Election

1. **Notification**: The initial step involves notifying the IRS of your intent to make the 83(b) election. This must be done within 30 days of the stock [grant](../g/grant.md).
2. **Letter Submission**: You must send a letter to the IRS that includes information such as your name, address, [social security](../s/social_security.md) number, and details of the stock [grant](../g/grant.md).
3. **Employee’s Copy**: A copy of this letter should be provided to the employer.
4. **Save a Copy**: Always keep a copy for your personal records.
   
Below is a sample of the information that could be included in the 83(b) election letter:

```
Pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Code, the undersigned hereby elects to include in [gross income](../g/gross_income.md) the excess, if any, of the fair [market value](../m/market_value.md) of the property described below over the amount paid for such property.

1. The [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md)'s name, address, and [social security](../s/social_security.md) number.
2. A description of the property with respect to which the election is being made.
3. The date on which the property was transferred and the taxable year for which such election is being made.
4. The nature of the restriction to which the property is subject.
5. The fair [market value](../m/market_value.md) at the time of transfer.
6. The amount paid for the property.
7. Any other information required by the Treasury Regulations applicable to the tax year in which the property was transferred.

Dated: [date]
```

### Example Calculation

Imagine an employee named Jane receives 1,000 [shares](../s/shares.md) of her company's [restricted stock](../r/restricted_stock.md) when the FMV is $1 per share. Without an 83(b) election, she'll be taxed on the FMV of the stock as it vests. Suppose it vests at $5 per share in the future; she would owe [taxes](../t/taxes.md) on $5,000 (1,000 [shares](../s/shares.md) x $5).

If Jane decides to file an 83(b) election, she'll pay [taxes](../t/taxes.md) on the $1,000 [value](../v/value.md) now (1,000 [shares](../s/shares.md) x $1), regardless of the future FMV when the stock vests. This could result in a lower tax obligation.

## Risks and Benefits

The 83(b) election is not without risks, and weighing the benefits against potential downsides is essential.

### Benefits

- **Tax Savings**: By paying [taxes](../t/taxes.md) on the current lower [value](../v/value.md), potential tax savings can be significant if the stock appreciates.
- **[Capital](../c/capital.md) Gains**: Future appreciation can be taxed at the lower long-term [capital](../c/capital.md) gains rate instead of the higher [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md) rate.

### Risks

- **Loss of [Value](../v/value.md)**: If the stock's [value](../v/value.md) decreases, you might end up paying more in [taxes](../t/taxes.md) than you would have without the election.
- **Forfeiture**: If you leave the company before the stock vests, you cannot recover the [taxes](../t/taxes.md) already paid.
- **[Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md)**: Paying [taxes](../t/taxes.md) upfront can impact [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md), especially for [startup](../s/startup.md) employees who might not have the [liquid](../l/liquid.md) resources to pay these [taxes](../t/taxes.md).

## Practical Considerations

### Consulting with an Expert

Because of the complexities and potential risks involved, consulting with a tax advisor or [financial planner](../f/financial_planner.md) is strongly recommended. They can help evaluate whether an 83(b) election is the right choice based on individual circumstances, anticipated stock growth, and overall financial plans.

### Employer Policies

Understanding employer-specific policies is also crucial. Some companies might have specific instructions or additional requirements for making an 83(b) election. Always [check](../c/check.md) with the employer’s HR or stock plan administrator to ensure compliance.

### IRS Complications

Mistakes in filing the election or late submissions can result in missed opportunities and potential penalties. Ensuring that the filing is correct and timely is imperative.

## Current Trends and Technological Support

### Technological Tools

Several technological tools and platforms now [offer](../o/offer.md) assistance with filing 83(b) elections. These may include automated filing services, tax calculators, and software to track [equity compensation](../e/equity_compensation.md). Popular platforms like Carta (https://carta.com/) and Shareworks by Morgan Stanley (https://www.shareworks.com/) provide comprehensive [equity](../e/equity.md) management solutions that can facilitate the process.

### Increasing Awareness

There has been a growing awareness of the 83(b) election among [startup](../s/startup.md) communities and tech companies. Workshops, webinars, and online resources are increasingly available to help employees and founders understand the implications.

## Case Studies

### Example 1: Tech Startup

In a tech [startup](../s/startup.md) scenario, a programmer named Alex receives 5,000 [shares](../s/shares.md) at a $1 FMV per share when joining the company. He files an 83(b) election and pays [taxes](../t/taxes.md) on the $1 per share. Five years later, when the stock vests, the [shares](../s/shares.md) are worth $20 each. Without the 83(b) election, Alex would owe [taxes](../t/taxes.md) on $100,000 (5,000 [shares](../s/shares.md) x $20). By electing 83(b), he avoided a high [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md) on the appreciable [value](../v/value.md).

### Example 2: Pharmaceutical Company

Nevertheless, not all scenarios turn out positive. Consider a case in a pharmaceutical [startup](../s/startup.md) where an employee named Sara files an 83(b) election for 2,000 [shares](../s/shares.md) with a $5 FMV per share, paying [taxes](../t/taxes.md) on $10,000. If the drug fails and the stock plummets to $1 per share by [vesting](../v/vesting.md) time, Sara ends up overpaying in [taxes](../t/taxes.md) since the stock depreciated.

## Conclusion

The 83(b) election is a powerful tool that can lead to significant tax savings, particularly in high-growth scenarios typical of startups. However, the decision to file an 83(b) election should never be taken lightly. Potential risks must be considered, and specialized tax advice is crucial. Understanding the financial landscape, the company's potential, and personal circumstances [will](../w/will.md) inform whether the 83(b) election is beneficial.

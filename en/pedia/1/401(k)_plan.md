# 401(k) Plan

A 401(k) plan is a retirement savings plan sponsored by an employer. It allows employees to invest a portion of their paycheck into [long-term investments](../l/long-term_investments.md) with tax advantages. The name comes from the section of the Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Code—section 401(k)—that governs the plan. Introduced in 1978, this plan has become one of the most prevalent retirement savings structures in the United States.

## Key Features of a 401(k) Plan

### Tax Advantages
One of the primary benefits of a 401(k) plan is its tax-advantageous status. Contributions made to a traditional 401(k) are [tax-deferred](../t/tax_deferred.md), meaning that employees do not pay [taxes](../t/taxes.md) on the [money](../m/money.md) until it is withdrawn. This feature can be particularly beneficial during peak earning years, as it allows contributors to defer paying [taxes](../t/taxes.md) until retirement, when they may be in a lower tax bracket. Some 401(k) plans also [offer](../o/offer.md) a Roth option, wherein contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but [earnings](../e/earnings.md) and withdrawals are [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md).

### Employer Matches
Many employers opt to match a portion of employee contributions to the 401(k) plan, effectively providing "free [money](../m/money.md)" to bolster retirement savings. The specifics of employer matches can vary widely, but a typical format may involve the employer matching 50 cents for every dollar contributed by the employee, up to a certain percentage of their salary, often 5-6%.

### Contribution Limits
The IRS sets annual limits on how much an individual can contribute to a 401(k). For example, in 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 for those under 50 and an additional "catch-up" contribution of $7,500 for those aged 50 and above. These limits are periodically adjusted for [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

### Investment Options
Employers typically [offer](../o/offer.md) a variety of investment [options](../o/options.md) within a 401(k) plan, including mutual funds, [stocks](../s/stock.md), and bonds. Participants can generally choose their own [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) according to their [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) and financial goals. Some plans also [offer](../o/offer.md) target-date funds, which automatically adjust the [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) based on the participant's age and expected retirement date.

## How to Manage a 401(k) Plan

### Diversification
[Diversification](../d/diversification.md) involves spreading investments across different [asset](../a/asset.md) classes to reduce [risk](../r/risk.md). Since 401(k) plans [offer](../o/offer.md) a [range](../r/range.md) of investment [options](../o/options.md), employees have the opportunity to diversify their portfolios. This strategy can help mitigate the [risk](../r/risk.md) of losing [money](../m/money.md) if a single investment performs poorly.

### Regular Review
It's essential to review the 401(k) plan at least annually to ensure that the investment choices still align with your long-term retirement goals. [Market](../m/market.md) conditions change, and so do individual circumstances; periodic review and adjustment can help maintain an optimal [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md).

### Rebalancing
Over time, some investments may perform better than others, causing the allocation to drift away from the initial plan. [Rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) involves realigning the proportions of different assets to maintain the desired level of [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md). This is usually done annually or semi-annually.

### Fees
401(k) plans come with various fees, such as administrative, [investment management](../i/investment_management.md), and individual service fees. While fees are a necessary aspect of maintaining the plan, it's crucial to understand and manage them as they can significantly impact long-term returns. Participants should look out for [fee](../f/fee.md) disclosures in their plan documentation and aim to select lower-cost [options](../o/options.md) when available.

## Regulatory Considerations

### ERISA Compliance
401(k) plans must comply with the Employee Retirement [Income](../i/income.md) [Security](../s/security.md) Act (ERISA) of 1974. ERISA sets minimum standards to ensure that plans are managed in the best interests of participants. It requires fiduciaries to act responsibly and provides participants with the right to sue for benefits and breaches of fiduciary duty.

### IRS Regulations
The Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Service (IRS) has specific requirements that 401(k) plans must follow, including nondiscrimination testing to ensure that the plan benefits all employees fairly and Contribution Limits regulations. Plans must file annual reports (Form 5500) to the IRS and Department of Labor (DOL).

### Distributions
Participants are generally required to begin taking distributions from their 401(k) at age 72 (recently increased from age 70½). These distributions are subject to [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md). There are also provisions for required minimum distributions (RMDs) and specific rules for early withdrawals, including potential penalties for withdrawals before age 59½.

## Technology and 401(k)

### Digital Platforms
In the digital age, several platforms and financial technology companies have developed tools to help manage 401(k) plans. Online portals provide real-time access to account balances, [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md), and [transaction](../t/transaction.md) histories. Many platforms [offer](../o/offer.md) educational resources to help participants make informed investment decisions.

### Robo-Advisors
Some 401(k) plans now incorporate robo-advisors, which use algorithms to manage investments. These automated advisors can create a diversified portfolio based on an individual's [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) and financial goals, often at a lower cost than human advisors. Companies like Betterment and Wealthfront [offer](../o/offer.md) such services.

### Mobile Access
Many 401(k) providers [offer](../o/offer.md) mobile apps that allow participants to manage their accounts on the go. These apps often include features like balance checking, contribution adjustments, and even educational content. The convenience of mobile access helps participants stay engaged with their [retirement planning](../r/retirement_planning.md).

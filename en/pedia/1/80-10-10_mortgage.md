# 80-10-10 Mortgage

An 80-10-10 [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) is a [loan](../l/loan.md) option that enables homebuyers to [finance](../f/finance.md) their [home](../h/home.md) purchases with an 80% [first mortgage](../f/first_mortgage.md), a 10% second [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md), and a 10% [down payment](../d/down_payment.md). This arrangement can be particularly advantageous for those seeking to avoid private [mortgage insurance](../m/mortgage_insurance.md) (PMI) or those who may not have the means to put down a larger [deposit](../d/deposit.md).

## Structure of the 80-10-10 Mortgage

The 80-10-10 [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) is made up of three components:

1. **[First Mortgage](../f/first_mortgage.md) (80%)**: This is the primary [loan](../l/loan.md), typically a [conventional mortgage](../c/conventional_mortgage.md), covering 80% of the [home](../h/home.md)'s purchase price.
2. **Second [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) (10%)**: Often referred to as a piggyback [loan](../l/loan.md), this [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) covers 10% of the purchase price. The second [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) can take the form of a [home equity](../h/home_equity.md) [loan](../l/loan.md) or a [home equity](../h/home_equity.md) line of [credit](../c/credit.md) (HELOC).
3. **[Down Payment](../d/down_payment.md) (10%)**: The homebuyer contributes 10% of the [home](../h/home.md)'s purchase price as a [down payment](../d/down_payment.md) from their own funds.

### Example

For a [home](../h/home.md) priced at $500,000:
- **[First Mortgage](../f/first_mortgage.md) (80%)**: $400,000
- **Second [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) (10%)**: $50,000
- **[Down Payment](../d/down_payment.md) (10%)**: $50,000

## Advantages

### Avoiding PMI

One of the primary benefits of an 80-10-10 [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) is the avoidance of private [mortgage insurance](../m/mortgage_insurance.md) (PMI). PMI is typically required for conventional loans where the [down payment](../d/down_payment.md) is less than 20% of the [home](../h/home.md)'s [value](../v/value.md). For buyers unable to make a 20% [down payment](../d/down_payment.md) but wanting to avoid the additional cost of PMI, this layered [financing](../f/financing.md) option is ideal.

### Lower Initial Cash Outlay

An 80-10-10 [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) can also make [home](../h/home.md) ownership more accessible by reducing the amount of cash needed upfront. By dividing the [financing](../f/financing.md), homebuyers are required to put down only 10%, rather than the traditional 20%.

### Possible Tax Benefits

The [interest](../i/interest.md) on both the [first mortgage](../f/first_mortgage.md) and the second [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) may be tax-deductible, although it's always advisable to consult with a tax professional regarding specific details.

### Financial Flexibility

The structure of the 80-10-10 [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) boosts financial flexibility. For instance, in situations of rising property values or increased [personal income](../p/personal_income.md), homeowners can always pay off the second [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) earlier without immediate pressure.

## Disadvantages

### Higher Interest Rates on Second Mortgage

The [interest](../i/interest.md) rates for the second [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) are generally higher compared to the primary [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md), which can increase overall borrowing costs. It is crucial to consider this when opting for an 80-10-10 [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md).

### Complexity and Additional Fees

Managing two mortgages can be more complex and might involve extra fees. Borrowers should be prepared for potentially higher costs due to closing costs for two separate loans and additional administrative fees.

### Potential for Negative Amortization

In cases where the second [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) is a HELOC with a [variable interest rate](../v/variable_interest_rate.md), there is the [risk](../r/risk.md) of [negative amortization](../n/negative_amortization.md), where the owed amount to the [lender](../l/lender.md) increases regardless of payments made. This situation arises if the payments do not cover the accruing [interest](../i/interest.md).

## Key Considerations

### Type of Second Mortgage

The second 10% [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) can be either a fixed-rate [home equity](../h/home_equity.md) [loan](../l/loan.md) or a variable-rate [home equity](../h/home_equity.md) line of [credit](../c/credit.md) (HELOC). Borrowers need to thoroughly evaluate which option fits their financial strategy and [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md).

### Loan Terms and Conditions

It is imperative to scrutinize the terms and conditions of both the first and second mortgages. Factors to consider include [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, [repayment](../r/repayment.md) periods, closing costs, and potential [prepayment](../p/prepayment.md) penalties.

### Financial Long-Term Goals

Borrowers should assess their long-term financial goals, including future [income](../i/income.md) expectations and plans for the property. Considering these aspects [will](../w/will.md) ensure that the 80-10-10 [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) aligns well with personal financial trajectories.

### Lender Choice

Choosing the right [lender](../l/lender.md) is crucial. Not all lenders [offer](../o/offer.md) 80-10-10 mortgages, and terms can vary significantly. Homebuyers should relentlessly compare offerings from different financial institutions before making a decision.

One such financial institution that provides various [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) products, including second [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [options](../o/options.md), is **Morton [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)**. More information can be found on their official website: [Morton Mortgage](https://mortonmortgage.net/).

## Conclusion

An 80-10-10 [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) can serve as an effective [home](../h/home.md) [financing](../f/financing.md) solution, especially for those aiming to avoid PMI and manage a more affordable [down payment](../d/down_payment.md). However, potential borrowers should carefully weigh the benefits against the complexities and costs. By doing thorough research, consulting with financial advisors, and evaluating personal financial situations, homebuyers can [leverage](../l/leverage.md) this [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) structure to make informed and beneficial choices in their [home](../h/home.md) purchasing journey.

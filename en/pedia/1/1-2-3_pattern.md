# 1-2-3 Pattern

The 1-2-3 pattern is a well-known and simple yet powerful [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) tool used by traders, particularly in the realm of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). This pattern is often employed to identify potential [trend](../t/trend.md) reversals in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). It consists of three distinct points forming either a pattern signifying a potential bullish or bearish [reversal](../r/reversal.md). Despite its simplicity, itâ€™s a favorite among traders due to its effectiveness in recognizing turning points in price movement.

### Anatomy of the 1-2-3 Pattern

A 1-2-3 pattern can be classified as bullish or bearish, depending on its formation:

- **Bullish 1-2-3 Pattern:** This pattern indicates a potential [reversal](../r/reversal.md) from a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md) to an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md).
- **Bearish 1-2-3 Pattern:** This pattern indicates a potential [reversal](../r/reversal.md) from an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md) to a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md).

#### Bullish 1-2-3 Pattern
1. **Point 1: The lowest low of the recent [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md).**
2. **Point 2: A subsequent high (higher than Point 1).**
3. **Point 3: A higher low that stays above Point 1 but below Point 2.**

Once Point 3 has been formed, a break above Point 2 signals a bullish [reversal](../r/reversal.md) confirmation.

```markdown
              Point 2
                /\
               /  \
Point 3      /     \ 
  \        /         \
   \      /           \
    \    /             Point 1
```

#### Bearish 1-2-3 Pattern
1. **Point 1: The highest high of the recent [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md).**
2. **Point 2: A subsequent low (lower than Point 1).**
3. **Point 3: A lower high that stays below Point 1 but above Point 2.**

Once Point 3 has been formed, a break below Point 2 signals a bearish [reversal](../r/reversal.md) confirmation.

```markdown
 Point 1
     /\
    /  \
   /    \
  /      \
 /        \      Point 3
/          \    /
           \/  /            
            \/  
            Point 2
```

### Steps to Identify the 1-2-3 Pattern

1. **Identify the [Trend](../t/trend.md):** First, confirm the existing [trend](../t/trend.md). For a bullish 1-2-3 pattern, there should be an existing [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md), and for a bearish 1-2-3 pattern, there should be an existing [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md).
2. **Locate Point 1:** Identify the lowest low in a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md) for a bullish pattern or the highest high in an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md) for a bearish pattern.
3. **Identify Point 2:** Look for a subsequent high in a bullish pattern (higher than Point 1) or a subsequent low in a bearish pattern (lower than Point 1).
4. **Identify Point 3:** Find a higher low (above Point 1 but below Point 2) for a bullish pattern or a lower high (below Point 1 but above Point 2) for a bearish pattern.
5. **Confirm the [Breakout](../b/breakout.md):** The pattern is confirmed when the price breaks above Point 2 in a bullish pattern or below Point 2 in a bearish pattern.

### Application in Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), or algo-trading, involves using automated [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) to execute trades based on predefined algorithms and rules. The 1-2-3 pattern can be scripted into an [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) strategy to exploit potential [trend](../t/trend.md) reversals.

Here's how the 1-2-3 pattern can be incorporated into an algo-[trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md):

1. **Define Parameters:** Set parameters to identify Points 1, 2, and 3 based on historical price data.
2. **Integrate with [Technical Indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md):** Combine the 1-2-3 pattern with [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) (like moving averages, RSI, MACD) to enhance the accuracy of [trend reversal](../t/trend_reversal.md) signals.
3. **Develop Entry and Exit Rules:** Write algorithms to execute buy orders once the price breaks above Point 2 (for a bullish signal) or sell orders once the price breaks below Point 2 (for a bearish signal).
4. **Backtest the Strategy:** Perform rigorous [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) against historical price data to ensure the strategy's robustness and effectiveness.
5. **Implement [Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md):** Incorporate stop-loss and take-[profit](../p/profit.md) levels to manage [risk](../r/risk.md) and protect against significant losses.

### Example of Algorithm for 1-2-3 Pattern in Python (Pseudocode)

```python
[import](../i/import.md) pandas as pd
[import](../i/import.md) numpy as np

def identify_123_pattern(data):
    data['High'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=5).max()
    data['Low'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=5).min()
    data.dropna(inplace=True)
    
    points = []
    
    for i in [range](../r/range.md)(len(data)):
        if i > 5 and i < len(data) - 5:
            
            Point_1 = data['Low'][i-5:i].min()
            Point_2 = data['High'][i-5:i].max()
            Point_3 = data['Low'][i-3:i].min()
            
            if Point_1 < Point_3 < Point_2:
                pattern = 'Bullish'
                points.append({'Point_1': Point_1, 'Point_2': Point_2, 'Point_3': Point_3, 'Type': pattern})
                
            elif Point_1 > Point_3 > Point_2:
                pattern = 'Bearish'
                points.append({'Point_1': Point_1, 'Point_2': Point_2, 'Point_3': Point_3, 'Type': pattern})

    [return](../r/return.md) points

# Example usage:
data = pd.read_csv('historical_data.csv')
patterns = identify_123_pattern(data)
print(patterns)
```

### Considerations and Challenges

1. **[False Signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md):** The 1-2-3 pattern can generate [false signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md), particularly in a choppy or sideways [market](../m/market.md) environment. It is crucial to combine the pattern with other confirmation tools.
2. **[Market](../m/market.md) Conditions:** The [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) of the 1-2-3 pattern can vary depending on [market](../m/market.md) conditions. It may work better in trending markets than in ranging markets.
3. **Algorithm Complexity:** While identifying the 1-2-3 pattern may seem simple, implementing it as part of an algorithmic strategy requires consideration of different [market](../m/market.md) scenarios, [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), and [optimization](../o/optimization.md) techniques.

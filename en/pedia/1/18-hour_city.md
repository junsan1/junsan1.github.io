# 18-Hour City

The term "18-hour city" refers to an urban area that is vibrant and active for 18 hours a day, compared to traditional "24-hour cities" like New York and London, which are known for being bustling around the clock.

Typically, 18-hour cities combine robust economic growth, significant cultural attractions, and increasingly attractive real estate markets.

# 408(k) Plan

## Introduction

The world of retirement savings can be complex, given the variety of [options](../o/options.md) available to both employers and employees. Among these [options](../o/options.md) are the well-known 401(k) plans, and the less frequently discussed 408(k) plans. While 401(k) plans are standard in the corporate world, 408(k) plans, often known as Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) plans, are particularly beneficial for small [business](../b/business.md) owners and self-employed individuals. This document provides a thorough understanding of the 408(k) plan, its workings, and how it compares to the more common [401(k) plan](../1/401(k)_plan.md).

## What is a 408(k) Plan?

A 408(k) plan, commonly referred to as a SEP (Simplified Employee Pension) plan, is a retirement savings plan that allows small [business](../b/business.md) owners and self-employed individuals to make contributions toward their employees' retirement as well as their own. This type of plan is established under section 408(k) of the Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Code.

### Key Characteristics of a 408(k) Plan

- **Simplicity**: SEP plans are less complex compared to other retirement savings plans, making them easier to set up and maintain. They do not require annual filings with the IRS, unlike other pension plans.
- **Contribution Limits**: Contributions to a SEP plan are more flexible and can be substantial. Employers can contribute up to 25% of each employee's compensation, with a cap of $66,000 for the year 2023.
- **Employer Contributions Only**: Unlike a 401(k), where both employees and employers contribute, in a 408(k) plan, only employers make contributions.
- **Eligibility**: Any employer, including self-employed individuals, can set up a SEP plan. Employees must be at least 21 years old, have worked for the employer for three of the last five years, and received at least $750 in compensation for the year (as of 2023).
- **Investments**: Funds in a SEP plan can be invested in a variety of [options](../o/options.md), including [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, and mutual funds, similar to other retirement accounts.

## How a 408(k) Plan Works

### Establishing a SEP Plan

To establish a SEP plan, an employer must take the following steps:

1. **Execute a Formal Written Agreement**: This can usually be done by filling out IRS Form 5305-SEP or using a pre-approved SEP prototype from a financial institution or pension consultant.
2. **Provide Eligible Employees With Information About the SEP**: Employers must inform their employees about the plan, how it works, and how contributions [will](../w/will.md) be determined.
3. **Set Up Individual SEP-IRAs for Each Employee**: Each eligible employee must have an individual SEP-IRA account where the employer's contributions [will](../w/will.md) be deposited.

### Making Contributions

Only employers can make contributions to a SEP plan. The contribution rate must be the same for all eligible employees, meaning if the employer contributes 10% of compensation to one employee’s SEP-IRA, they must do the same for all employees.

### Tax Treatment

SEP contributions are tax-deductible for employers, and they are not included in the employee’s [gross income](../g/gross_income.md). However, they are subject to [Social Security](../s/social_security.md), Medicare, and federal [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) (FUTA) [taxes](../t/taxes.md).

### Withdrawal Rules

Employees can withdraw funds from their SEP-IRAs at any time. However, withdrawals are subject to regular [income tax](../i/income_tax.md) and, if the employee is under 59½, an additional 10% early [withdrawal penalty](../w/withdrawal_penalty.md) may apply.

## Comparing 408(k) Plans to 401(k) Plans

### Employer Contributions

- **[401(k) Plan](../1/401(k)_plan.md)**: Both employers and employees can contribute to a [401(k) plan](../1/401(k)_plan.md). Employers often match employee contributions, up to a certain percentage.
- **408(k) Plan**: Only employers contribute to a SEP plan. There are no employee contributions.

### Contribution Limits

- **[401(k) Plan](../1/401(k)_plan.md)**: Employees can contribute up to $22,500 (as of 2023) with an additional catch-up contribution of $7,500 for those aged 50 and over.
- **408(k) Plan**: Employers can contribute up to 25% of each employee's compensation, with a cap at $66,000 for 2023.

### Administrative Burden

- **[401(k) Plan](../1/401(k)_plan.md)**: Requires detailed annual filings with the IRS. Plan administrators must also undergo several compliance tests to ensure that the plan meets IRS requirements.
- **408(k) Plan**: Does not require annual filings with the IRS, and the paperwork is straightforward. No compliance tests are needed.

### Plan Complexity

- **[401(k) Plan](../1/401(k)_plan.md)**: More complex to set up and maintain, often requiring the help of financial and legal advisors.
- **408(k) Plan**: Easier to establish and operate, which makes it ideal for small businesses and self-employed individuals.

### Flexibility and Control

- **[401(k) Plan](../1/401(k)_plan.md)**: Employees have greater control over their retirement savings and investments.
- **408(k) Plan**: Primarily controlled by employers, as they are the sole contributors.

## Pros and Cons of SEP Plans

### Pros

1. **Simplicity and Ease of Setup**: The SEP plan is notably simpler to establish compared to a 401(k). It doesn’t involve the complicated administrative procedures and compliance tests that other retirement plans require.
2. **High Contribution Limits**: SEP plans allow for larger contributions than many other retirement savings plans, making them attractive for high-earning small [business](../b/business.md) owners and self-employed individuals.
3. **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are tax-deductible for the employer, which can significantly reduce [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md).
4. **Flexibility**: Employers can decide whether to make contributions each year. Contributions can vary, and there is no requirement to make them every year.

### Cons

1. **Employer-Only Contributions**: In SEP plans, only employers can contribute. This can be a disadvantage if employees prefer to contribute a portion of their salary themselves.
2. **Uniform Contribution Rate**: Employers must contribute the same percentage of compensation for every eligible employee, which might be costly for businesses with many employees.
3. **Immediate [Vesting](../v/vesting.md)**: Contributions to a SEP plan are immediately vested, meaning employees own the funds right away. This can be a drawback if the employer's aim is to use retirement benefits as a long-term employee retention tool.
4. **Early [Withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) Penalties**: Withdrawals before the age of 59½ are subject to a 10% early [withdrawal penalty](../w/withdrawal_penalty.md), along with regular [income tax](../i/income_tax.md).
 
## 408(k) Plan Employer Use Cases

### Considerations for Small Businesses and Self-Employed Individuals

For small [business](../b/business.md) owners and self-employed individuals, the SEP plan can be an efficient way to save for retirement while benefiting from sizable tax deductions. Here are a few scenarios where a SEP plan might be particularly advantageous:

1. **Consistent High [Earnings](../e/earnings.md)**: A small [business](../b/business.md) with stable and high [earnings](../e/earnings.md) may want to maximize retirement contributions, thus reducing [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md). Given the high contribution limits, SEP plans are suitable for such businesses.
2. **Simplicity Preferred**: Businesses that lack the resources to manage complex retirement plans may prefer the straightforward nature of SEP plans. The minimal administrative burden can free the [business](../b/business.md) owner to concentrate on other aspects of the [business](../b/business.md).
3. **Solo Entrepreneurs**: Self-employed individuals with no employees can establish a SEP plan to take advantage of the high contribution limits without the need to manage contributions for other employees.

## Conclusion

The 408(k) SEP plan stands out as a [robust](../r/robust.md) and flexible retirement savings option, particularly tailored to meet the needs of small businesses and self-employed individuals. Its simplicity, ease of setup, high contribution limits, and considerable tax benefits make it a compelling choice for employers who may find the complexity and administrative burden of traditional 401(k) plans overwhelming. However, its employer-only contribution structure and the requirement for uniform percentage contributions are notable considerations that businesses must keep in mind.

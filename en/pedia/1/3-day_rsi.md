# 3-Day RSI

The 3-Day [Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (RSI) is a [momentum](../m/momentum.md) [oscillator](../o/oscillator.md) that measures the speed and change of price movements over a 3-day period. RSI oscillates between zero and 100 and is typically used to identify [overbought](../o/overbought.md) or [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions in a traded [security](../s/security.md). When applied to a 3-day time frame, it becomes a more short-term [indicator](../i/indicator.md) compared to the more traditional 14-day RSI. This shorter [duration](../d/duration.md) can help traders take faster action in response to [market](../m/market.md) events.

## Calculation of 3-Day RSI

The RSI is calculated using the following formula:

```
RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))

Where RS ([Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md)) = Average [Gain](../g/gain.md) of last N periods / Average Loss of last N periods
```

For the 3-Day RSI, N is set to 3. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step calculation breakdown:

1. **Average [Gain](../g/gain.md)** - Sum of all the positive gains in the last 3 days divided by 3.
2. **Average Loss** - Sum of all the losses in the last 3 days divided by 3.
3. **[Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) (RS)** - The ratio of the average [gain](../g/gain.md) to the average loss.
4. **RSI Calculation** - Utilize the RSI formula to get the final [value](../v/value.md).

## Interpretation of 3-Day RSI

### Overbought and Oversold Conditions

Like its 14-day counterpart, the 3-day RSI can identify [overbought](../o/overbought.md) or [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions:

- **[Overbought](../o/overbought.md)**: RSI above 70 typically indicates that the [asset](../a/asset.md) might be [overbought](../o/overbought.md) and due for a price [correction](../c/correction.md) or a [pullback](../p/pullback.md).
- **[Oversold](../o/oversold.md)**: RSI below 30 typically indicates that the [asset](../a/asset.md) might be [oversold](../o/oversold.md) and due for a bounce or a [rally](../r/rally.md).

### Divergence

[Divergence](../d/divergence.md) occurs when the price of the [security](../s/security.md) is moving in the opposite direction of the RSI. This can be a powerful signal that a [reversal](../r/reversal.md) might be imminent. There are two types of [divergence](../d/divergence.md):

- **[Bullish Divergence](../b/bullish_divergence.md)**: When the price makes a new low while the RSI makes a higher low, it may indicate an upcoming price increase.
- **[Bearish Divergence](../b/bearish_divergence.md)**: When the price makes a new high while the RSI makes a lower high, it may signal an upcoming price decrease.

### RSI Trendlines

Just as price trendlines can be drawn on price charts, trendlines can also be drawn on the RSI. This technique can help identify potential reversals or continuations in the [trend](../t/trend.md).

## Strategies Using 3-Day RSI

### RSI Crossover Strategy

One of the simplest strategies is the RSI crossover strategy where traders look for the RSI to cross above or below certain levels (typically 30 and 70) to make buy or sell decisions.

- **Buy Signal**: When the 3-day RSI crosses above 30, it may indicate a buying opportunity.
- **Sell Signal**: When the 3-day RSI crosses below 70, it may indicate a selling opportunity.

### RSI Swing Rejection

This strategy involves looking for RSI to re-enter a certain threshold:

- **Bullish Rejection**: RSI drops below 30 (indicating [oversold](../o/oversold.md)), rallies back above 30, pulls back, but stays above 30, and then moves higher.
- **Bearish Rejection**: RSI rises above 70 (indicating [overbought](../o/overbought.md)), drops back below 70, rallies back but stays below 70, and then moves lower.

### Combining with Other Indicators

The 3-Day RSI can be combined with other [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) like moving averages, MACD, or [Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md) to create more [robust](../r/robust.md) [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). For example, one might look for an RSI signal in combination with a moving average cross to confirm a [trade](../t/trade.md).

## Limitations of 3-Day RSI

While the 3-Day RSI can be a useful tool, it is not without its limitations:

- **[False Signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md)**: The shorter time frame makes it more sensitive to price movements, which can result in more [false signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md).
- **[Lagging Indicator](../l/lagging_indicator.md)**: Like all RSI calculations, it is based on past price data and may lag behind the actual price movement.
- **[Market](../m/market.md) Conditions**: It may not perform well in certain [market](../m/market.md) conditions, such as during strong trends where the price can remain [overbought](../o/overbought.md) or [oversold](../o/oversold.md) for extended periods.

## Conclusion

The 3-Day RSI is a valuable tool for traders looking for a more responsive and shorter-term [momentum](../m/momentum.md) [indicator](../i/indicator.md). By measuring the [relative strength](../r/relative_strength.md) over a 3-day period, it can provide timely signals for potential entry and exit points. However, as with any [indicator](../i/indicator.md), it should be used in conjunction with other analysis techniques to confirm signals and mitigate the [risk](../r/risk.md) of false positives.

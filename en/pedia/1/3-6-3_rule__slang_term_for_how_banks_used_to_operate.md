# 3-6-3 Rule: Slang Term for How Banks Used to Operate

In the mid-20th century era of banking, the term "3-6-3 rule" was coined as a colloquial explanation of how traditional banks operated. This rule encapsulated the simplicity and perceived profitability of banking during a time when the industry was less competitive and more regulated. Specifically, the 3-6-3 rule implied the following: banks would offer depositors an interest rate of 3%, loan out money at an interest rate of 6%, and the bankers would be on the golf course by 3 PM. Although said humorously, this rule highlighted the straightforward nature of banking at the time, focusing on wide interest margins and the lack of financial innovation and aggressive competition that characterize the modern banking landscape.

## The Foundations of the 3-6-3 Rule

The 3-6-3 rule emerged in a period marked by relatively limited banking services and less intense competition among financial institutions. Here is a closer examination of the rule's components:

### 3% on Deposits
Banks would traditionally offer a modest interest rate of 3% to attract deposits. This rate was stable and considered attractive enough for customers to entrust their savings to the bank. The simplicity of this approach was underpinned by regulatory frameworks that ensured interest rates remained within a certain band, reducing the likelihood of aggressive rate wars among banks.

### 6% on Loans
The 6% interest rate on loans was a reflection of the calculated risk banks assumed when lending out money. The relatively higher rate compared to what they offered on deposits allowed banks to maintain a healthy spread, ensuring profitability. Given the limited competition, banks were not compelled to lower their loan rates aggressively, which would impact their margin.

### 3 PM Golf Course
The phrase that bankers would be on the golf course by 3 PM symbolized the laid-back and less stressful nature of banking in that era. It implied that banking was such a straightforward and profitable business that bankers could afford to take the afternoon off, enjoying leisure activities with little concern about aggressive market competition or regulatory pressures.

## Historical Context and Regulation

This idyllic picture of banking was possible due to various factors, including regulatory frameworks and the economic environment of the time. The Glass-Steagall Act, introduced in 1933, played a substantial role in shaping the banking industry, particularly by separating commercial banking from investment banking. This regulation helped maintain a more stable and predictable environment for banks to operate within.

Moreover, during the mid-20th century, the U.S. economy experienced significant growth and stability. Post-World War II, the economic boom led to increased savings rates, higher disposable incomes, and a growing middle class, all of which contributed to the relatively predictable and stable banking environment that is encapsulated in the 3-6-3 rule.

## Transition to Modern Banking Practices

The financial landscape began to shift dramatically from the late 20th century onwards, leading to the eventual obsolescence of the 3-6-3 rule. Several key changes influenced this transition:

### Deregulation
The deregulation of banking practices, particularly during the 1980s and 1990s, eliminated many of the constraints that had previously governed banks' operations. Interest rate restrictions were lifted, geographic restrictions on banking were removed, and new financial instruments and practices were introduced. This increased competition significantly and reduced the straightforwardness formerly described by the 3-6-3 rule.

### Technological Advancements
The advent of technology transformed how banks operated. Automation of processes, the introduction of online banking, and innovations like ATMs and electronic funds transfers made banking more efficient but also more complex. This required banks to be more adaptive and competitive.

### Financial Innovation
Financial innovation led to the development of new products such as derivatives, securitized assets, and various structured investment vehicles. These products offered higher returns but also introduced higher levels of risk, fundamentally changing the risk-reward landscape for banks.

### Competition from Non-Bank Entities
Non-bank financial institutions began offering services that were traditionally within the purview of banks. Peer-to-peer lending platforms, fintech companies, and investment firms started to encroach on what was once considered the stable territory of commercial banking.

## The Legacy of the 3-6-3 Rule

Despite its obsolescence, the 3-6-3 rule serves as a nostalgic reference to a period when banking was perceived as being simpler and more predictable. It highlights how significantly the banking industry has evolved over the past few decades. Modern bankers operate in a far more competitive, regulated, and complex environment, where profitability margins are thinner, and the pace of change is relentless.

The 3-6-3 rule also underscores the significant impact of deregulation and technological advancement on the banking sector. It serves as a reminder of the critical balance that needs to be struck between maintaining profitability and managing risk in a highly dynamic financial ecosystem.

## Conclusion

In summary, the 3-6-3 rule is a slang term that humorously encapsulates the simplicity and perceived ease of profitability in mid-20th century banking. It reflects a time when the regulatory environment, limited competition, and economic stability allowed banks to operate with generous interest margins while engaging in leisurely activities. Today, the banking landscape has undergone profound changes driven by deregulation, technological advancements, financial innovation, and increased competition, making the era of the 3-6-3 rule a nostalgic memory rather than a current reality.

# 51% Attack

In the context of [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) and cryptocurrency, a 51% attack is an eminent threat where a group of miners or entities controls more than half of the network's [mining](../m/mining.md) [hash](../h/hash.md) rate or computational power. This type of attack compromises the decentralized nature of [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology and can lead to several damaging consequences, such as double spending, network disruption, and halting of transactions.

## What is a 51% Attack?
A 51% attack, also known as a majority attack, occurs when an attacker, or a colluding group of attackers, gains control over 50% of a [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) network's [hash](../h/hash.md) rate. This majority enables them to create, validate, and manipulate [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) entries. The attacker can potentially reverse transactions, prevent new transactions from confirming, and double-spend coins.

## How it Works
The [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) relies on a consensus mechanism to validate and record transactions. In most cases, Proof of Work (PoW) is the primary consensus method. Miners solve complex mathematical puzzles to add new transactions to the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md). A 51% attack unfolds as follows:

1. **[Gain](../g/gain.md) Control:** The attacker amasses more than 50% of the [mining](../m/mining.md) power or stakes, depending on the consensus mechanism.
2. **Private Chain Formation:** The attacker can start [mining](../m/mining.md) blocks privately, faster than the rest of the network.
3. **Double Spending:** The attacker spends their cryptocurrency in the public chain, while simultaneously spending it in their private chain.
4. **Chain [Reorganization](../r/reorganization.md):** Once the attacker has mined a sufficient number of blocks, they release the private, longer chain to the network.
5. **Longest Chain Rule:** The [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) protocol favors the longest chain, resulting in the public chain being overridden by the attacker's chain.
6. **[Transaction](../t/transaction.md) [Reversal](../r/reversal.md):** The previously confirmed transactions on the ousted shorter chain, including the legitimate spend, become invalid, allowing the attacker to reclaim their original coins plus any goods or services received in the public chain.

## Potential Consequences
A 51% attack presents several adverse effects for the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) and its participants:

1. **Double Spending:** The attacker can spend the same cryptocurrency [multiple](../m/multiple.md) times.
2. **[Transaction](../t/transaction.md) Exclusion:** The attacker can prevent specific transactions or the entire block from being included in the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md).
3. **Network Instability:** Frequent successful attacks undermine [trust](../t/trust.md) in the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md), leading to decreased [value](../v/value.md) and user exodus.
4. **Reduced Miner Incentives:** As [trust](../t/trust.md) and usage decline, legitimate miners may find the network unprofitable and cease operations.

## Examples of 51% Attacks
Several blockchains have faced successful 51% attacks, including:

1. **[Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) Gold (BTG):** In May 2018, [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) Gold experienced a 51% attack where attackers double-spent 388,000 BTG, roughly worth $18 million.
2. **[Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) Classic (ETC):** In January 2019, [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) Classic suffered a series of 51% attacks, leading to [double-spending](../d/double-spending.md) of ETC tokens.
3. **Verge (XVG):** Verge saw [multiple](../m/multiple.md) 51% attacks in 2018, resulting in significant financial losses and questioning its [security](../s/security.md).

## Preventive Measures
Preventive measures can mitigate 51% attacks, though complete eradication remains challenging. Some strategies include:

1. **Increased [Hash](../h/hash.md) Rate:** A higher [hash](../h/hash.md) rate makes it expensive and impractical for attackers to [gain](../g/gain.md) control.
2. **Network Decentralization:** Distributing [mining](../m/mining.md) power among numerous miners reduces the chances of [collusion](../c/collusion.md).
3. **Alternative Consensus Methods:** Adopting Proof of Stake (PoS) or other mechanisms can reduce susceptibility.
4. **Checkpointing:** Implementing frequent and irreversible checkpoints in the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) to prevent [reorganization](../r/reorganization.md).
5. **Chain Locks:** Techniques like ChainLocks (used by Dash) deter [double-spending](../d/double-spending.md) by instantly locking confirmed blocks.

## Case Study: GHash.io and Bitcoin
GHash.io was one of the largest [Bitcoin mining](../b/bitcoin_mining.md) pools in history. During July 2014, GHash.io briefly controlled over 51% of the [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) network's [hash](../h/hash.md) rate, sparking 51% attack fears. In response, the community urged decentralization efforts and miners left the pool to distribute the [hash](../h/hash.md) rate more evenly, reducing GHash.io's dominance.

## Conclusion
The 51% attack represents a significant [security](../s/security.md) [risk](../r/risk.md) in [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology. While complete elimination of this threat is difficult, a combination of strategic measures and community vigilance can mitigate the [risk](../r/risk.md) and protect the network's integrity. As the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) ecosystem evolves, continuous assessment and adaptation of [security](../s/security.md) practices [will](../w/will.md) remain crucial to maintaining decentralized [trust](../t/trust.md).

# 30-Day RSI

The [Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (RSI) is a [momentum](../m/momentum.md) [oscillator](../o/oscillator.md) that measures the speed and change of price movements. Considered one of the most popular [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) tools, it was developed by J. Welles Wilder. The RSI oscillates between 0 and 100. Traditionally, an RSI reading above 70 is considered [overbought](../o/overbought.md), while an RSI reading below 30 is considered [oversold](../o/oversold.md). The 30-Day RSI is a specific application of this [indicator](../i/indicator.md) where the calculation considers the past 30 days of data.

## Formula and Calculation

The RSI is calculated using the following formula:

\[ RSI = 100 - \left( \frac{100}{1 + RS} \right) \]

where RS ([Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md)) is the average of 'n' days' up closes divided by the average of 'n' days' down closes:

\[ RS = \frac{\text{Average [Gain](../g/gain.md)}}{\text{Average Loss}} \]

For a 30-Day RSI, the calculation includes the past 30 days of trading data. Here’s a step-by-step guide to calculating the 30-Day RSI:

1. **Determine the Gains and Losses**:
   - Calculate the closing price changes from one day to the next.
   - If the closing price is higher than the previous day, the difference is considered a [gain](../g/gain.md).
   - If the closing price is lower than the previous day, the difference is considered a loss.

2. **Calculate the Average Gains and Losses**:
   - Sum the gains over the past 30 days and divide by 30.
   - Sum the losses over the past 30 days and divide by 30.

3. **Calculate the [Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) (RS)**:
   - Divide the 30-day average [gain](../g/gain.md) by the 30-day average loss.

4. **Calculate the RSI**:
   - Use the formula above to compute the RSI [value](../v/value.md).

## Interpretation of 30-Day RSI

The 30-Day RSI, being a longer-term [indicator](../i/indicator.md) compared to the more commonly used 14-Day RSI, is less sensitive to short-term price movements but provides a smoothed understanding of the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s [price momentum](../p/price_momentum.md). 

### Overbought and Oversold Conditions

- **[Overbought](../o/overbought.md) Condition**: If the RSI is above 70, the [asset](../a/asset.md) is generally considered [overbought](../o/overbought.md). This could be a signal that the [asset](../a/asset.md) is [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md) and might be due for a price [correction](../c/correction.md) or [pullback](../p/pullback.md).
- **[Oversold](../o/oversold.md) Condition**: If the RSI is below 30, the [asset](../a/asset.md) is considered [oversold](../o/oversold.md). This might indicate that the [asset](../a/asset.md) is [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) and could be due for a price rebound.

### Divergences

Divergences between the RSI and the price movement of the [asset](../a/asset.md) can also serve as a signal for potential price reversals. For instance:
- **[Bullish Divergence](../b/bullish_divergence.md)**: Occurs when the price makes a new low but the RSI makes a higher low. This might indicate weakening downward [momentum](../m/momentum.md) and a potential upcoming upward [reversal](../r/reversal.md).
- **[Bearish Divergence](../b/bearish_divergence.md)**: Occurs when the price makes a new high but the RSI makes a lower high. This might indicate weakening upward [momentum](../m/momentum.md) and a potential upcoming downward [reversal](../r/reversal.md).

### Trend Identification 

The RSI can also be useful in identifying the overall [trend](../t/trend.md) of the [asset](../a/asset.md):
- An RSI that consistently stays above 50 in a 30-day period might indicate a strong bullish [trend](../t/trend.md).
- Conversely, an RSI that consistently stays below 50 might indicate a strong bearish [trend](../t/trend.md).

## Practical Applications and Trading Strategies

The 30-Day RSI can be used in various [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). Some traders use it as a standalone [indicator](../i/indicator.md), while others combine it with other [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) tools to confirm their [trading signals](../t/trading_signals.md).

### RSI Swing Rejections

This strategy involves looking for instances when the RSI moves into an [overbought](../o/overbought.md) or [oversold](../o/oversold.md) territory and then swiftly exits. For a bullish signal:
- The RSI moves into the [oversold](../o/oversold.md) zone (<30).
- The RSI crosses back above 30.
- The RSI then pulls back, but does not hit [oversold](../o/oversold.md) levels again.
- The RSI then makes a new high (without crossing into [overbought](../o/overbought.md) territory).

A similar but opposite approach is used for bearish signals.

### RSI with Support and Resistance Levels

Another common strategy involves combining the RSI with [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels:
- Traders look for confluence where the RSI enters [overbought](../o/overbought.md) or [oversold](../o/oversold.md) territory near significant support or resistance levels.

### RSI with Moving Averages

Some traders combine the 30-Day RSI with moving averages to validate trends:
- For instance, if the RSI is above 50 and the price is above a key moving average (such as the 50-day or [200-day moving average](../1/200-day_moving_average.md)), it could affirm a bullish [trend](../t/trend.md).

### RSI and Chart Patterns

RSI can be used in conjunction with [chart patterns](../c/chart_patterns.md), such as head and shoulders, triangles, and flags. When an RSI signal coincides with a [breakout](../b/breakout.md) from a key chart pattern, it can provide stronger confirmation for entry or exit points.

## Limitations of 30-Day RSI

While the 30-Day RSI is a powerful tool, it is not without limitations:
- **[Lagging Indicator](../l/lagging_indicator.md)**: Being a [momentum](../m/momentum.md) [oscillator](../o/oscillator.md), the RSI can give signals that lag price movements. Thus, it might not always provide timely signals.
- **[False Signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md)**: In highly volatile or erratic markets, the RSI can produce [false signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md), leading to potential losses if not used with other confirmation tools.
- **Doesn't Consider Fundamental Factors**: RSI is purely technical and does not take into account fundamental factors affecting an [asset](../a/asset.md)’s price.

## Conclusion

The 30-Day RSI is a valuable tool for long-term traders looking to filter out short-term [noise](../n/noise.md) and focus on broader [price momentum](../p/price_momentum.md) trends. By understanding the calculations, interpretations, and various [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) involving the RSI, traders can better utilize this [indicator](../i/indicator.md) in their trading arsenal. However, it’s crucial to remember that no single [indicator](../i/indicator.md) should be relied upon solely, and the RSI is most effective when used in conjunction with other [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) tools and considerations.

# 529 Savings Plan

A 529 savings plan is a [tax-advantaged](../t/tax-advantaged.md) [investment vehicle](../i/investment_vehicle.md) designed to encourage saving for future education costs. These plans, named after Section 529 of the Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Code, have become a popular method for families to save for the education expenses of their children and other beneficiaries. This detailed overview [will](../w/will.md) explore various aspects of [529 plans](../1/529_plan.md), including their types, benefits, limitations, investment [options](../o/options.md), tax advantages, state-specific features, and financial aid impact.

## Types of 529 Plans

There are two main types of [529 plans](../1/529_plan.md):

### 1. College Savings Plans

College savings plans are investment accounts that grow based on the performance of [underlying](../u/underlying.md) investments, such as mutual funds and [exchange](../e/exchange.md)-traded funds (ETFs). They [offer](../o/offer.md) flexibility in terms of where the [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md) can use the funds, which can be applied to a variety of educational institutions and qualified educational expenses.

### 2. Prepaid Tuition Plans

Prepaid tuition plans allow account holders to purchase units or credits at participating colleges and universities, locking in current tuition rates to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against future tuition increases. These plans are typically limited to in-state public institutions, although some states [offer](../o/offer.md) [options](../o/options.md) for private and out-of-state institutions through consortium agreements.

## Benefits of 529 Plans

### 1. Tax Advantages

- **[Tax-Free](../t/tax_free.md) Growth**: Investments in a 529 plan grow free from [federal income](../f/federal_income.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md).
- **[Tax-Free](../t/tax_free.md) Withdrawals**: Withdrawals for qualified educational expenses are also exempt from federal [taxes](../t/taxes.md).
- **State Tax Benefits**: Many states [offer](../o/offer.md) tax deductions or credits on contributions to their state’s [529 plans](../1/529_plan.md).

### 2. High Contribution Limits

Unlike other [tax-advantaged](../t/tax-advantaged.md) accounts like IRAs or Coverdell ESAs, [529 plans](../1/529_plan.md) typically have high contribution limits, often exceeding $300,000 per [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md) over the lifetime of the account.

### 3. Low Impact on Financial Aid

[529 plans](../1/529_plan.md) owned by parents are considered parental assets for federal financial aid purposes, which generally results in a lower impact on the [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md)'s financial aid eligibility compared to student-owned assets.

### 4. Control Over Funds

The account owner retains control over the account, including the ability to change beneficiaries or make strategic decisions regarding investment choices.

### 5. Investment Options

[529 plans](../1/529_plan.md) typically [offer](../o/offer.md) a [range](../r/range.md) of investment [options](../o/options.md), including age-based portfolios that automatically adjust the investment mix as the [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md) approaches college age.

## Limitations and Considerations

### 1. Penalties for Non-Qualified Withdrawals

Withdrawals that are not used for qualified education expenses are subject to [federal income](../f/federal_income.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) and a 10% penalty on the [earnings](../e/earnings.md) portion of the [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md).

### 2. Limited Investment Options

Investment [options](../o/options.md) are limited to the offerings of the plan, which may restrict investors who prefer a broader [range](../r/range.md) of choices.

### 3. State-Specific Variability

Each state operates its 529 plan, and benefits, fees, and investment [options](../o/options.md) can vary significantly between plans. It’s important to research and compare plans to find one that aligns with your savings goals.

## Qualified Educational Expenses

### 1. Tuition and Fees

This includes costs for tuition and mandatory fees at eligible institutions.

### 2. Room and Board

For students enrolled at least half-time, 529 plan funds can be used for room and board, subject to the limits published by the educational institution.

### 3. Books, Supplies, and Equipment

Expenses for textbooks, supplies, and equipment required for courses are covered.

### 4. Computers and Technology

Computers, software, and internet access used primarily for educational purposes can be paid for with 529 plan funds.

### 5. K-12 Tuition

Following the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, up to $10,000 per year can be used for private, public, or religious K-12 tuition.

## Tax Advantages in Detail

### 1. Federal Tax Benefits

The primary federal [tax benefit](../t/tax_benefit.md) of a 529 plan is [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md) growth and [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md) withdrawals for qualified expenses. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but the account grows [tax-deferred](../t/tax_deferred.md).

### 2. State Tax Benefits

State tax benefits vary, with many states [offering](../o/offering.md) tax deductions or credits to residents who contribute to their state’s [529 plans](../1/529_plan.md). Some states provide tax [parity](../p/parity.md), allowing deductions for contributions to any state’s plan.

### 3. Gift Tax Benefits

Contributions to [529 plans](../1/529_plan.md) qualify for the annual [gift tax](../g/gift_tax.md) exclusion, which currently is $15,000 per year per [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md) (as of 2021). Superfunding provisions allow up to five years of contributions to be made in a single year without incurring gift [taxes](../t/taxes.md).

## Investment Options

### 1. Age-Based Portfolios

These portfolios automatically adjust the [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) to become more conservative as the [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md) approaches college age.

### 2. Static Portfolios

Investors can choose a fixed [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) that does not change over time, providing more control over investment choices.

### 3. Individual Investment Options

Some plans [offer](../o/offer.md) individual mutual funds and ETFs for those who prefer to create a custom investment mix.

## State-Specific Features

### 1. In-State Benefits

States often provide additional benefits for in-state residents, including tax deductions, matching grants, or scholarships.

### 2. Fees and Expenses

Fees and expenses can vary widely between state plans, affecting the overall [return](../r/return.md) on investment. It’s important to review and compare these costs.

### 3. Residency Requirements

While anyone can invest in most state [529 plans](../1/529_plan.md), some benefits may be restricted to state residents.

## Impact on Financial Aid

### 1. Federal Methodology (FAFSA)

[529 plans](../1/529_plan.md) owned by parents reduce financial aid eligibility by up to 5.64% of the account [value](../v/value.md), unlike student-owned accounts, which reduce aid eligibility by 20%.

### 2. Institutional Methodology (CSS Profile)

Some private institutions use the CSS Profile, which may have different rules regarding [asset](../a/asset.md) consideration.

## Choosing a 529 Plan

### 1. Evaluate State Options

Consider both your [home](../h/home.md) state’s plan and plans from other states that may [offer](../o/offer.md) lower fees or better investment [options](../o/options.md).

### 2. Compare Fees

Analyze the plan’s [fee](../f/fee.md) structure, including administrative fees, program management fees, and investment [expense](../e/expense.md) ratios.

### 3. Review Investment Options

Ensure the plan offers an appropriate [range](../r/range.md) of investment [options](../o/options.md) that align with your [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) and [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md).

### 4. Assess Performance

Look at historical performance data for the plan’s investment [options](../o/options.md), keeping in mind that past performance is not indicative of future results.

### 5. Check State Benefits

Review any state-specific benefits, such as tax deductions or matching [grant](../g/grant.md) programs, which can add significant [value](../v/value.md) to your savings efforts.

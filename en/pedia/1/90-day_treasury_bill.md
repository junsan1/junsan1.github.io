# 90-Day Treasury Bill

The 90-Day Treasury Bill (T-Bill) is a short-term debt obligation backed by the U.S. government with a maturity of 90 days. As a cornerstone instrument in the money markets, it provides numerous advantages and insights into economic conditions, especially in the context of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). Here, we delve into the intricate details of the 90-Day T-Bill, its workings, implications, and significance in the realm of algotrading.

### Understanding Treasury Bills

**Treasury Bills (T-Bills)** are one of the safest investments available and a key fixture of the U.S. financial infrastructure. These are short-term securities with maturities ranging from a few days to 52 weeks. T-Bills are sold at a discount to face value (par) and do not provide periodic interest payments; the interest is implied in the difference between the purchase price and the par value paid at maturity.

### Key Characteristics of 90-Day T-Bills

1. **Maturity**: As the name suggests, a 90-Day T-Bill matures in 90 days from the issue date.
2. **Auction Process**: These T-Bills are sold through a competitive bidding process conducted by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Auctions are frequent, typically every week.
3. **Yield Calculation**: The yield of a 90-Day T-Bill is determined by the difference between its purchase price and the amount received at maturity.
4. **Liquidity**: 90-Day T-Bills are highly liquid, making them an ideal vehicle for short-term parking of funds.
5. **Risk**: Given their backing by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, 90-Day T-Bills are considered virtually risk-free with no default risk.

### Importance in Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) (algotrading) refers to the use of computer algorithms to execute [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) at speeds and frequencies infeasible for human traders. T-Bills, including the 90-Day T-Bill, play a critical role in this space due to several reasons:

1. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Algotrading strategies often require managing large sums of money where [capital preservation](../c/capital_preservation.md) is crucial. The stability and security of 90-Day T-Bills make them a safe haven asset for temporary cash storage.
2. **Benchmark Rates**: The yield on 90-Day T-Bills serves as a benchmark interest rate for various other financial instruments. It is often used as a risk-free rate in financial models, providing a foundation for pricing [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) and assessing the risk premiums of other securities.
3. **Market Sentiment Indicator**: The demand for T-Bills can be an indicator of market sentiment. High demand for 90-Day T-Bills may indicate a flight to safety by investors, suggesting an increase in market volatility or economic [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md). Algorithms can be designed to interpret these signals and adjust [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) accordingly.
4. **Interest Rate Predictions**: Movements in the yields of 90-Day T-Bills can help in predicting the future trajectory of interest rates. This is invaluable for algotrading strategies that are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations.

### Auction Mechanism

**Non-Competitive Bids**: Non-competitive bids are guaranteed to be filled and allow smaller investors to participate without specifying the yield they are willing to accept. The rate received is the average rate of all the competitive bids accepted.

**Competitive Bids**: Institutional investors and sophisticated traders typically place competitive bids, specifying the discount rate they are willing to accept. T-Bills are then awarded starting from the lowest discount rate until the entire issue amount is allocated.

### Calculating Yield on 90-Day T-Bills

The yield on a T-Bill can be calculated using the following formula:

\[ \text{Yield} = \left( \frac{\text{Face Value} - \text{Purchase Price}}{\text{Purchase Price}} \right) \times \left( \frac{365}{\text{Days to Maturity}} \right) \]

For a 90-Day T-Bill:
\[ \text{Yield} = \left( \frac{\$10,000 - \$9,900}{\$9,900} \right) \times \left( \frac{365}{90} \right) \approx 4.05\% \]

### Historical Performance and Analysis

Over the decades, the yield on 90-Day T-Bills has fluctuated significantly, reflecting varying economic conditions and [Federal Reserve policies](../f/federal_reserve_policies.md). For instance:

- **1980s**: Periods of high inflation saw T-Bill yields surge.
- **Early 2000s**: Yields plummeted following the dot-com bubble burst and 9/11 attacks.
- **2008 Financial Crisis**: Yields dropped near zero as investors flocked to safety amidst unprecedented market turbulence.
- **Recent Trends**: Yields remain relatively low but have witnessed increases following policy rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.

### Integrating T-Bills in Algotrading Strategies

1. **[Pairs Trading](../p/pairs_trading.md)**: Utilize the predictability and stability of T-Bill yields in [pairs trading](../p/pairs_trading.md) strategies by coupling them with more volatile assets.
2. **Rate Spread [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**: Leverage the spreads between different T-Bill maturities to implement [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategies.
3. **Hedging**: Use 90-Day T-Bills as a hedge against uncertain market conditions or specific portfolio exposures.
4. **[Yield Curve](../y/yield_curve.md) Analysis**: Incorporate [yield curve](../y/yield_curve.md) data into machine learning models to predict [economic cycles](../e/economic_cycles.md) and adjust [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) accordingly.

### Conclusion

The 90-Day Treasury Bill is a fundamental asset that offers both safety and strategic value, especially in a highly automated [trading environment](../t/trading_environment.md). Its attributes, historical significance, and role in interest rate mechanisms make it a vital tool for [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), market analysis, and trading strategy formulation.

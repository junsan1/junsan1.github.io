# 10-Day RSI

The 10-Day Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements over a 10-day period. Developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr., RSI is one of the most widely used [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) in trading. The RSI provides signals indicating overbought or oversold conditions in a market, helping traders make entry and exit decisions.

## Calculation of 10-Day RSI

The RSI is calculated using the following formula:

\[ \text{RSI} = 100 - \frac{100}{1 + RS} \]

where:

\[ RS = \frac{\text{Average Gain}}{\text{Average Loss}} \]

For a 10-Day RSI:

1. Compute the daily price changes.
2. Separate the changes into gains and losses.
3. Calculate the average gain and average loss over the first 10 periods.
4. For subsequent periods, use a smoothed average that incorporates the previous dayâ€™s results.

Mathematically, the smoothed averages can be represented as:

\[ \text{Average Gain} = \frac{(\text{Previous Average Gain} \times 9) + \text{Current Gain}}{10} \]

\[ \text{Average Loss} = \frac{(\text{Previous Average Loss} \times 9) + \text{Current Loss}}{10} \]

## Interpretation of RSI Values

RSI values range from 0 to 100 and can typically be interpreted as follows:

- **Above 70**: The asset is considered overbought, signaling a potential pullback or correction.
- **Below 30**: The asset is considered oversold, indicating a potential upward correction.
- **Between 30 and 70**: The asset is likely to be in a stable trading range.

However, traders often adjust these thresholds based on the asset's history and market conditions.

## Applications in Algo-Trading

In [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), the 10-Day RSI can be used in the development of automated [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). These strategies might involve:

1. **[Trend Following](../t/trend_following.md)**: Using RSI to identify the strength of a trend and enter trades aligned with that trend.
2. **[Mean Reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md)**: Entering trades when RSI indicates overbought or oversold conditions, anticipating that the price will revert to the mean.
3. **Divergence Trading**: Identifying divergences between RSI and price movements to signal potential reversals.

### Example Strategy

A simple RSI-based trading strategy might be as follows:

- **Buy Signal**: When the 10-Day RSI crosses above 30.
- **Sell Signal**: When the 10-Day RSI crosses below 70.

Many platforms and programming languages, such as Python with the `pandas` and `ta-lib` libraries, allow traders to backtest and execute such strategies.

## Combining RSI with Other Indicators

RSI is often used in conjunction with other indicators to improve the robustness of [trading signals](../t/trading_signals.md). Common combinations include:

- **Moving Averages (MA)**: To confirm trends signaled by the RSI.
- **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**: To provide additional confirmation of buy/sell signals.
- **[Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md)**: To identify overbought/oversold conditions in conjunction with RSI.

## Platforms for RSI-Based Algo-Trading

Several platforms and software offer tools for implementing and [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) RSI-based strategies:

- **MetaTrader 4/5**: A popular trading platform that supports automated trading through Expert Advisors (EAs).
- **[NinjaTrader](../n/ninjatrader.md)**: Offers advanced charting and [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) capabilities.
- **[QuantConnect](../q/quantconnect.md)**: A cloud-based platform allowing [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) in multiple languages, including Python.
- **[TradingView](../t/tradingview.md)**: Provides scripting tools (Pine Script) for creating and testing custom RSI strategies.

## Real-World Usage

Major hedge funds and trading firms utilize RSI in their algorithmic strategies, although they often combine it with more complex algorithms and machine learning models.

For example, Renaissance Technologies, one of the most successful hedge funds, is known for using sophisticated algorithms that likely combine multiple [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md), including RSI. More about Renaissance Technologies can be found [here](https://www.rentec.com/).

## Conclusion

The 10-Day RSI is a versatile and widely-used technical indicator in both manual and [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). Its ability to signal overbought and oversold conditions makes it a valuable tool for various [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). By combining RSI with other indicators and using modern trading platforms, traders can enhance their decision-making process and potentially improve their trading outcomes.

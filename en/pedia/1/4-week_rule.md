# 4-Week Rule

The 4-Week Rule is a [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) often used in the realm of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). Formulated by Richard Donchian, a pioneer in the field of [managed futures](../m/managed_futures.md), the 4-Week Rule is an easy-to-understand method for identifying potential breakouts in the [market](../m/market.md). This trading rule is often employed by traders looking to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on [market](../m/market.md) [momentum](../m/momentum.md) and signifies a basic [trend](../t/trend.md)-following methodology. 

## Fundamental Concepts

### Breakout Trading
The core idea behind the 4-Week Rule is [breakout trading](../b/breakout_trading.md). A [breakout](../b/breakout.md) occurs when the price of an [asset](../a/asset.md) moves outside a defined support or resistance level with increased [volume](../v/volume.md). According to this strategy, if the price of a [security](../s/security.md) moves to a 4-week high, it is likely to continue rising, and if it moves to a 4-week low, it is likely to continue falling. 

### Time Frame
The rule utilizes a 4-week period, i.e., 20 trading days, to determine breakouts. This period is optimal enough to filter out short-term [noise](../n/noise.md) and small price movements while capturing medium-term trends.

## Strategy Mechanics

### Buy Signal
The 4-Week Rule generates a buy signal when the closing price of a [security](../s/security.md) exceeds the highest high of the previous 4 weeks. To execute this, the following criteria must be met:
1. Identify the highest high over the past 4 weeks.
2. If the current closing price is above this high, enter a long position.

### Sell Signal
Conversely, the rule generates a sell signal when the closing price of a [security](../s/security.md) drops below the lowest low of the past 4 weeks. The criteria for a sell signal are:
1. Identify the lowest low over the past 4 weeks.
2. If the current closing price is below this low, enter a short position.

## Practical Application

While the 4-Week Rule is relatively simple to apply, its effectiveness can be enhanced by integrating it into a more comprehensive trading framework. This often involves incorporating [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices, such as [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md) and [position sizing](../p/position_sizing.md), and possibly combining it with other [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) for additional confirmation.

### Example Code (Python)

To implement the 4-Week Rule in a Python-based [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) environment, you can use the following code:

```python
[import](../i/import.md) pandas as pd

def four_week_rule(data):
    """
    Implement the 4 Week Rule for [breakout trading](../b/breakout_trading.md).
    
    Params:
    data - A pandas DataFrame containing 'Close' prices with a datetime [index](../i/index.md).
    
    Returns:
    buy_signals, sell_signals - Boolean Series indicating buy and sell signals.
    """
    # Rolling window for 4 weeks (20 trading days)
    highest_high = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).max()
    lowest_low = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).min()
    
    # Buy signal
    buy_signals = data['Close'] > highest_high.shift(1)
    
    # Sell signal
    sell_signals = data['Close'] < lowest_low.shift(1)
    
    [return](../r/return.md) buy_signals, sell_signals

# Example usage
data = pd.read_csv('historical_prices.csv', index_col='Date', parse_dates=True)
buy_signals, sell_signals = four_week_rule(data)
```

### Industry Practice and Considerations

Many professional trading firms and individual traders employ variations of the 4-Week Rule. Adapting the rule to different [market](../m/market.md) conditions and time frames can significantly improve its effectiveness. However, it is essential to backtest any strategy with historical data to understand its performance characteristics and potential drawdowns.

### Strategy Evaluation

#### Pros
1. **Simplicity**: The 4-Week Rule is straightforward to implement and understand.
2. **[Trend Following](../t/trend_following.md)**: It effectively captures medium-term trends, allowing traders to ride significant price movements.
3. **Objective**: The rules are clear-cut, eliminating most of the ambiguity that can accompany [discretionary trading](../d/discretionary_trading.md).

#### Cons
1. **Whipsaws**: The strategy can generate [false signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md) in choppy or sideways markets, leading to potential losses.
2. **[Lagging Indicator](../l/lagging_indicator.md)**: Like many [trend](../t/trend.md)-following methods, the 4-Week Rule can be slow to react to rapidly changing [market](../m/market.md) conditions.
3. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: The rule does not inherently include [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices, so traders must implement their measures to protect their [capital](../c/capital.md).

## Conclusion

The 4-Week Rule remains a popular and effective [trend](../t/trend.md)-following strategy in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). Its simplicity and ease of use have made it a staple for many [trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md). However, success with this strategy hinges on proper implementation, including supplementary [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) techniques and perhaps combining it with other indicators or methods to filter out [false signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md).

For more advanced implementations, many traders look to platforms like [QuantConnect](https://www.quantconnect.com) or [Alpaca](https://alpaca.markets) to backtest and deploy [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) based on the 4-Week Rule among other strategies.

By effectively utilizing the principles of [breakout trading](../b/breakout_trading.md) encapsulated in the 4-Week Rule, traders can potentially enhance their returns and [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on significant [market](../m/market.md) trends.

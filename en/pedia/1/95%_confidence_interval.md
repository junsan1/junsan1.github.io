# 95% Confidence Interval

A 95% [confidence interval](../c/confidence_interval.md) (CI) is a statistical concept widely used in various fields including [finance](../f/finance.md), particularly in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). It provides a [range](../r/range.md) of values which is likely to contain the population parameter with a specified level of confidence â€“ in this case, 95%. This means that if we were to take 100 different samples and compute a [confidence interval](../c/confidence_interval.md) for each sample, then approximately 95 of those intervals would contain the true population parameter.

## Understanding Confidence Intervals

### The Basics

The [confidence interval](../c/confidence_interval.md) is typically expressed in the form:

\[ \bar{X} \pm Z_{\[alpha](../a/alpha.md)/2} \left( \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \right) \]

where:
- \(\bar{X}\) is the sample mean
- \(Z_{\[alpha](../a/alpha.md)/2}\) is the [Z-value](../z/z-value_in_trading.md) from the standard [normal distribution](../n/normal_distribution_in_trading.md) corresponding to the desired confidence level (for 95%, it is 1.96)
- \(\sigma\) is the [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) of the population
- \(n\) is the sample size

### More About Z-values

In the context of a 95% [confidence interval](../c/confidence_interval.md), the [Z-value](../z/z-value_in_trading.md) (also known as the critical [value](../v/value.md)) is a [factor](../f/factor.md) that is derived from the standard [normal distribution](../n/normal_distribution_in_trading.md). For a 95% [confidence interval](../c/confidence_interval.md), the [Z-value](../z/z-value_in_trading.md) is approximately 1.96. This [value](../v/value.md) is derived from the fact that:

- 95% of the data lies within 1.96 standard deviations from the mean in a standard [normal distribution](../n/normal_distribution_in_trading.md).

### Common Misunderstandings

One common misunderstanding about [confidence intervals](../c/confidence_intervals.md) is that there is a 95% probability that the population parameter lies within the interval calculated from a single sample. This is incorrect. The true interpretation is that if we were to draw numerous samples and calculate the CI for each, 95% of these intervals would capture the true parameter.

## Application in Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) involves utilizing computer algorithms to automate [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). These algorithms rely heavily on statistical methods to make predictions and decisions. [Confidence intervals](../c/confidence_intervals.md) play a crucial role in assessing the reliability and stability of these predictions.

### Estimating Expected Returns and Risks

Algorithmic traders often have to estimate expected returns and associated risks for various assets. The 95% [confidence interval](../c/confidence_interval.md) can be used to determine the [range](../r/range.md) within which the true [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) of an [asset](../a/asset.md) is likely to lie based on historical data. For example, if an algorithm is designed to [trade](../t/trade.md) based on the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) of a stock, the [confidence interval](../c/confidence_interval.md) can provide boundaries within which the [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md) are reliable.

### Backtesting Trading Strategies

[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) is a method used to test a [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) on historical data to see how it would have performed in the past. [Confidence intervals](../c/confidence_intervals.md) are used in [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) to determine the robustness of a [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md). For instance, the [average return](../a/average_return.md) of the strategy might be useful, but understanding the [confidence interval](../c/confidence_interval.md) around this [return](../r/return.md) can provide insights into the [variability](../v/variability.md) and reliability of the strategy.

### Risk Management

In [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), understanding and managing [risk](../r/risk.md) is critical. [Confidence intervals](../c/confidence_intervals.md) can be used to estimate the [Value](../v/value.md) at [Risk](../r/risk.md) (VaR) and Conditional [Value](../v/value.md) at [Risk](../r/risk.md) (CVaR) for a portfolio. These [risk measures](../r/risk_measures.md) are essential for determining the potential loss in [value](../v/value.md) of assets in a [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) under normal [market](../m/market.md) conditions, which helps in making informed decisions about [risk management](../r/risk_management.md).

## Calculating a 95% Confidence Interval

To calculate a 95% [confidence interval](../c/confidence_interval.md) for the population mean when the population [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) is known, the following steps are generally followed:

1. **Calculate the Sample Mean (\(\bar{X}\))**: Sum all the observations and divide by the number of observations.
  
2. **Determine the Population [Standard Deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) (\(\sigma\))**: If this is not known, it [will](../w/will.md) have to be estimated from the sample.
  
3. **Find the [Z-value](../z/z-value_in_trading.md) (\(Z_{\[alpha](../a/alpha.md)/2}\))**: For a 95% [confidence interval](../c/confidence_interval.md), the [Z-value](../z/z-value_in_trading.md) is 1.96.
  
4. **Compute the [Margin](../m/margin.md) of Error (ME)**:
   \[ ME = Z_{\[alpha](../a/alpha.md)/2} \left( \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \right) \]

5. **Determine the [Confidence Interval](../c/confidence_interval.md)**:
   \[ \text{CI} = \bar{X} \pm ME \]

### Example Calculation

Suppose an algorithmic [trader](../t/trader.md) wants to estimate the average daily [return](../r/return.md) of a particular stock. Based on a sample of 50 trading days, the sample mean (\(\bar{X}\)) is 0.0012, and the population [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) (\(\sigma\)) is estimated to be 0.002.

1. **Sample Mean (\(\bar{X}\))**: 0.0012

2. **Population [Standard Deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) (\(\sigma\))**: 0.002

3. **[Z-value](../z/z-value_in_trading.md) for 95% CI**: 1.96

4. **Sample Size (n)**: 50

5. **[Margin](../m/margin.md) of Error (ME)**: 
   \[ ME = 1.96 \left( \frac{0.002}{\sqrt{50}} \right) = 1.96 \left( 0.000283 \right) \approx 0.000555 \]

6. **95% [Confidence Interval](../c/confidence_interval.md)**: 
   \[ CI = 0.0012 \pm 0.000555 \]
   \[ CI = (0.000645, 0.001755) \]

Thus, the [trader](../t/trader.md) can be 95% confident that the true average daily [return](../r/return.md) of the stock lies between 0.000645 and 0.001755.

# 90/10 Strategy

The 90/10 strategy in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) is a sophisticated approach that aims to optimize the performance of [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) by allocating 90% of the trading strategy's capital to low-risk, high-certainty trades, and 10% to high-risk, high-reward trades. This strategy strikes a balance between steady profits and the potential for high earnings from occasional, higher-risk trades.

## Introduction to Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), also known as algo-trading or black-box trading, involves using computer algorithms to automate trading decisions and strategies. These algorithms are designed to follow specific instructions (such as timing, price, or volume) and can execute trades at speeds and frequencies far greater than human traders.

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) is used by institutional investors and large brokerage firms to manage portfolios. However, the advancements in technology have made it accessible for retail traders as well. The key benefits of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) include reduced transaction costs, increased trading efficiency, and removal of human emotions from trading decisions.

## Core Principles of the 90/10 Strategy

The 90/10 strategy hinges on two core principles: [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) and diversification. By dividing the capital into two distinct pools, traders can manage risks more effectively while still allowing room for significant gains.

### 1. The 90% Allocation: Low-Risk Trades

- **Nature of Low-Risk Trades**: These are trades that involve lower volatility, more predictable assets, and shorter time frames. Examples may include high-grade corporate bonds, blue-chip stocks, or trades based on market-moving news backed by strong data.
- **Execution**: Algorithms for these trades might employ mean-reversion strategies, [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) opportunities, or trend-following methods based on robust statistical models.
- **Objective**: The primary goal is to ensure steady, consistent returns with minimal drawdowns. This portion of the strategy focuses on safeguarding the bulk of the capital and compounding modest gains over time.

### 2. The 10% Allocation: High-Risk Trades

- **Nature of High-Risk Trades**: These are speculative trades that involve higher volatility, riskier assets, and longer time frames. Examples include small-cap stocks, cryptocurrencies, or leveraged positions.
- **Execution**: Algorithms for these trades can use strategies like [swing trading](../s/swing_trading.md), position trading, or options trading based on [predictive models](../p/predictive_models_in_trading.md) that identify high-reward opportunities.
- **Objective**: The aim is to achieve significant gains from a small portion of the capital, accepting the higher risk involved. This part of the strategy leverages the potential for high returns to boost the overall performance of the portfolio.

## Development and Implementation of the 90/10 Strategy

Creating a 90/10 strategy involves multiple steps, including designing, [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md), optimizing, and deploying the algorithms.

### 1. Designing the Strategy

- **Market Analysis**: Understand the market dynamics and identify low-risk and high-risk opportunities.
- **[Algorithm Design](../a/algorithm_design.md)**: Develop algorithms tailored to different market conditions and risk profiles.

### 2. Backtesting

- **Historical Data**: Use historical market data to simulate trading and assess the strategy's performance.
- **Metrics Evaluation**: Analyze key [performance indicators](../p/performance_indicators.md) (KPIs) such as [Sharpe ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md), maximum drawdown, and annualized return to ensure the strategy's robustness.

### 3. Optimization

- **Parameter Tuning**: Adjust the algorithm parameters to improve [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md).
- **[Stress Testing](../s/stress_testing_in_trading.md)**: Test the strategy under various market conditions to identify potential weaknesses.

### 4. Deployment

- **Live Trading**: Deploy the algorithms in a real [trading environment](../t/trading_environment.md) using a reliable trading platform.
- **Monitoring and Adjustment**: Continuously monitor the performance and make necessary adjustments to the strategy.

## Risk Management in the 90/10 Strategy

Effective [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) is crucial for the success of the 90/10 strategy. Key [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices include:

### 1. Position Sizing

- **Fixed Fractional Method**: Determine the position size as a fixed percentage of the total capital.
- **Volatility-Based [Position Sizing](../p/position_sizing.md)**: Adjust position sizes based on the asset's volatility to protect against large losses.

### 2. Stop-Loss Orders

- **Automated Stop-Loss**: Set predefined stop-loss levels to automatically exit trades that move against the position.
- **Trailing Stop-Loss**: Use trailing [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md) to lock in profits as the trade moves in favor.

### 3. Diversification

- **Cross-Asset Diversification**: Spread investments across different asset classes to mitigate risk.
- **Time Diversification**: Operate algorithms that capitalize on different time frames to balance short-term and long-term risks.

## Examples and Case Studies

### Example 1: QuantInsti's 90/10 Strategy

QuantInsti offers educational resources and strategies for [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), including the 90/10 strategy. They emphasize the importance of data analysis, algorithmic design, and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) in executing successful 90/10 strategies. More details can be found on their [website](https://www.quantinsti.com/).

### Example 2: Proprietary Trading Firms

[Proprietary trading](../p/proprietary_trading.md) firms often use the 90/10 strategy to hedge their portfolios. They focus on market-neutral strategies for the 90% allocation and high-beta strategies for the 10%. These firms leverage their advanced technology and market access to optimize their [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

## Conclusion

The 90/10 strategy in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) offers a balanced approach to risk and reward. By allocating 90% of the capital to low-risk, high-certainty trades and 10% to high-risk, high-reward trades, traders can achieve consistent returns while still capturing significant gains from speculative opportunities. Effective implementation of this strategy requires robust [algorithm design](../a/algorithm_design.md), rigorous [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md), and proactive [risk management](../r/risk_management.md).

The evolution of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) and advancements in AI and machine learning continue to enhance the success of strategies like the 90/10 approach. As traders and firms adapt to changing market conditions, the 90/10 strategy remains an essential part of the [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) toolkit.

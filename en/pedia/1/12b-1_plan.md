# 12B-1 Plan

The 12B-1 Plan, under the [Investment Company Act of 1940](../i/investment_company_act_of_1940.md), allows mutual funds to charge shareholders for [distribution](../d/distribution.md) and [marketing](../m/marketing.md) expenses. Named after the section of the statute that permits them, these fees are designed to cover the costs of advertising, promotion, and selling [shares](../s/shares.md) of the [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md), including compensating brokers and others who sell [fund](../f/fund.md) [shares](../s/shares.md). Though these fees can be beneficial in certain contexts, they remain a controversial aspect of [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md) management due to their impact on [investor](../i/investor.md) returns.

## Origins and Regulatory Framework

The plan was introduced by the U.S. Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) in 1980, when mutual funds were in a nascent stage of their development. The introduction of [12B-1 fees](../1/12b-1_fees.md) aimed to provide additional revenues and, in theory, help mutual funds grow and deliver better returns through scale. The rule permitted mutual funds to deduct expenses related to [distribution](../d/distribution.md) directly from the assets of the [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md).

## Types of 12B-1 Fees

### Distribution Fees

[Distribution](../d/distribution.md) fees, often referred to as “[12B-1 fees](../1/12b-1_fees.md)” colloquially, involve costs that go towards [marketing](../m/marketing.md) and selling [fund](../f/fund.md) [shares](../s/shares.md). These fees can be used for mailings, advertising, and compensating brokers who sell the [fund](../f/fund.md) to new investors.

### Service Fees

Service fees are used to compensate brokers or other entities for providing ongoing services to [fund](../f/fund.md) shareholders. This includes activities such as answering inquiries and providing information to investors.

## Fee Structure

[12B-1 fees](../1/12b-1_fees.md) are typically charged as a percentage of a [fund](../f/fund.md)'s assets, and the SEC limits these fees to 1% of a [fund](../f/fund.md)’s average net assets per year. These fees are further broken down into:

- **[Marketing](../m/marketing.md) and [Distribution](../d/distribution.md) Fees**: Limited to 0.75% of the [fund](../f/fund.md)’s assets annually.
- **Service Fees**: Limited to 0.25% of the [fund](../f/fund.md)’s assets annually.

## Share Classes and 12B-1 Fees

Many mutual funds [offer](../o/offer.md) various share classes, each with different [fee](../f/fee.md) structures:

- **Class A [shares](../s/shares.md)**: Typically have a [front-end load](../f/front-end_load.md) but lower [12B-1 fees](../1/12b-1_fees.md).
- **Class B [shares](../s/shares.md)**: Often have higher [12B-1 fees](../1/12b-1_fees.md) and contingent deferred sales charges.
- **Class C [shares](../s/shares.md)**: Might have the highest [12B-1 fees](../1/12b-1_fees.md) but no [front-end load](../f/front-end_load.md).

## Criticism and Controversy

The primary criticism of [12B-1 fees](../1/12b-1_fees.md) revolves around the argument that they often do not result in increased [investor](../i/investor.md) returns. Critics argue that these fees effectively reduce the net returns to investors and mainly work to benefit [fund](../f/fund.md) managers and brokers. Various studies have shown that mutual funds with high [12B-1 fees](../1/12b-1_fees.md) do not necessarily perform better than those with lower or no [12B-1 fees](../1/12b-1_fees.md).

## Alternatives to 12B-1 Fees

### No-Load Funds

No-[load](../l/load.md) mutual funds do not charge [12B-1 fees](../1/12b-1_fees.md). These funds usually have lower expenses and can be an attractive option for cost-conscious investors.

### Advisor Fees

Some investors choose to work with [fee](../f/fee.md)-only financial advisors, who charge flat fees rather than commissions, thereby avoiding potential conflicts of [interest](../i/interest.md).

## Regulatory Reforms

Given the controversy around [12B-1 fees](../1/12b-1_fees.md), the SEC has considered various reforms over the years. In 2010, it proposed significant changes to the [12B-1 fee](../1/12b-1_fee.md) structure, although the rule has not been significantly altered as of the latest regulatory updates.

## Conclusion

The 12B-1 Plan remains a significant component of [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md) [fee](../f/fee.md) structures, having both potential benefits and drawbacks. Investors should be aware of these fees when selecting mutual funds and consider whether the benefits justify the costs. Being an informed [investor](../i/investor.md) entails scrutinizing these and other fees to make educated decisions that align with one's financial goals.

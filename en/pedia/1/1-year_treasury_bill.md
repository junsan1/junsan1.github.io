# 1-Year Treasury Bill

A 1-Year Treasury Bill (T-Bill) represents a [short-term debt](../s/short-term_debt.md) obligation backed by the U.S. government with a [maturity](../m/maturity.md) of one year or less. These instruments are crucial components of what is often referred to as the [money market](../m/money_market.md), a segment of the financial [market](../m/market.md) where short-term financial instruments are traded. 1-Year T-Bills are known for their safety, [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), and predictability, making them a preferred investment choice for both individual and institutional investors. This document [will](../w/will.md) exhaustively describe the various dimensions of 1-Year Treasury Bills, including their characteristics, operational mechanisms, [market](../m/market.md) participants, pricing, [yield](../y/yield.md) calculation, investment strategies, risks, and advantages.

## Characteristics of 1-Year Treasury Bills

### Issuance and Availability
1-Year Treasury Bills are issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. They are typically sold via auction, which occurs regularlyâ€”usually weekly. These auctions ensure a steady [supply](../s/supply.md) of T-Bills to meet the demands of investors. 

### Denominations
1-Year T-Bills are available in various denominations, typically starting as low as $1,000 and going up in multiples of $1,000. This makes them accessible to a broad [range](../r/range.md) of investors.

### Zero-Coupon Nature
One of the key features of T-Bills, including the 1-Year variant, is their zero-coupon nature. This means that they are sold at a [discount](../d/discount.md) to their [face value](../f/face_value.md) and do not pay periodic [interest](../i/interest.md). Instead, the difference between the purchase price and the [face value](../f/face_value.md) at [maturity](../m/maturity.md) constitutes the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s [return](../r/return.md).

### Maturity Date
As the name suggests, 1-Year T-Bills have a [maturity](../m/maturity.md) period of one year. Upon reaching [maturity](../m/maturity.md), the U.S. government repays the [face value](../f/face_value.md) to the holder, regardless of the purchase price.

## The Auction Mechanism

### Non-Competitive Bidding
In a non-competitive [bid](../b/bid.md), an [investor](../i/investor.md) agrees to accept the [yield](../y/yield.md) determined at auction. This guarantees that the [investor](../i/investor.md) [will](../w/will.md) receive the full amount of the [face value](../f/face_value.md) of the T-Bill, but it does not guarantee a specific [yield](../y/yield.md). This type of bidding is generally preferred by retail investors and smaller institutions due to its simplicity and the [assurance](../a/assurance.md) of [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md).

### Competitive Bidding
In a competitive [bid](../b/bid.md), the [investor](../i/investor.md) specifies the [yield](../y/yield.md) or [discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md) they are willing to accept. If the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s specified [yield](../y/yield.md) matches or is above the auction's determined [yield](../y/yield.md), the [bid](../b/bid.md) is accepted. Competitive bidding is generally reserved for large institutional investors who can afford to be more sophisticated in their investment strategies.

## Pricing and Yield Calculation

### Discount Rate
The [discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md) is a key determinant of the T-Bill's price and [yield](../y/yield.md). This rate expresses the [security](../s/security.md)'s [return](../r/return.md) as an annualized percentage, calculated based on the difference between the purchase price and the [face value](../f/face_value.md) at [maturity](../m/maturity.md).

\[ \text{[Discount Rate](../d/discount_rate.md)} = \left( \frac{\text{[Face Value](../f/face_value.md)} - \text{Purchase Price}}{\text{[Face Value](../f/face_value.md)}} \right) \times \frac{360}{\text{Days to [Maturity](../m/maturity.md)}} \]

The reason for using 360 days rather than 365 is due to the convention used in [money](../m/money.md) markets.

### Yield Calculation
[Yield](../y/yield.md), the [return](../r/return.md) an [investor](../i/investor.md) receives on a T-Bill, can be calculated in two primary ways: the [Bank](../b/bank.md) [Discount Yield](../d/discount_yield.md) and the Investment [Yield](../y/yield.md).

```math
\text{[Bank](../b/bank.md) [Discount Yield](../d/discount_yield.md)} = \left( \frac{\text{[Discount](../d/discount.md) Amount}}{\text{[Face Value](../f/face_value.md)}} \right) \times \frac{360}{\text{Days to [Maturity](../m/maturity.md)}}
```

```math
\text{Investment [Yield](../y/yield.md)} = \left( \frac{\text{[Discount](../d/discount.md) Amount}}{\text{Purchase Price}} \right) \times \frac{365}{\text{Days to [Maturity](../m/maturity.md)}}
```

### Yield Curve Implications
The [yield curve](../y/yield_curve.md), which plots the yields of Treasury securities of varying maturities, plays a significant role in the context of 1-Year T-Bills. Typically, shorter maturities like the 1-Year T-Bill [yield](../y/yield.md) less than longer maturities due to lower [risk](../r/risk.md) and shorter [duration](../d/duration.md).

## Market Participants

### Individual Investors
Individual investors often turn to 1-Year T-Bills for their relative safety and predictability. These investors can participate in auctions via the TreasuryDirect website.

### Institutional Investors
Large financial institutions, mutual funds, and [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies also invest heavily in 1-Year T-Bills due to their [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and low-[risk](../r/risk.md) profile. Institutions usually prefer competitive bidding to manage large portfolios effectively.

### Foreign Governments
Foreign governments and central banks often [hold](../h/hold.md) T-Bills as part of their [foreign exchange reserves](../f/foreign_exchange_reserves.md). The stability and reliability of U.S. [debt](../d/debt.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md) make them attractive for preserving [capital](../c/capital.md).

## Investment Strategies

### Buy-and-Hold Strategy
A straightforward strategy where the [investor](../i/investor.md) holds the T-Bill until [maturity](../m/maturity.md) to capture the full [discount](../d/discount.md). This approach is low-[risk](../r/risk.md) and simple.

### Laddering
An [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) where an [investor](../i/investor.md) purchases T-Bills of varying maturities. This strategy helps manage [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md) and provides consistent [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md).

### Rolling Over
Investors may choose to reinvest the proceeds from maturing T-Bills into new ones. This roll-over strategy helps to maintain a low-[risk](../r/risk.md) profile while staying invested in short-term securities.

## Risks Involved

### Interest Rate Risk
While 1-Year T-Bills are less sensitive to [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) changes compared to longer-term bonds, they are not entirely immune. An increase in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates could lead to lower prices for existing T-Bills.

### Inflation Risk
Since T-Bills [offer](../o/offer.md) fixed returns, rising [inflation](../i/inflation.md) can erode their real [return](../r/return.md). In an inflationary environment, the [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) of the [maturity](../m/maturity.md) payoff may be less than anticipated.

### Liquidity Risk
Although T-Bills are highly [liquid](../l/liquid.md), selling them before [maturity](../m/maturity.md) could result in transactions at less favorable prices than those of newly issued T-Bills. This could lead to a less than optimal [yield](../y/yield.md).

## Advantages

### Safety of Principal
One of the most compelling features of 1-Year T-Bills is the virtually negligible [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md), given they are backed by the full faith and [credit](../c/credit.md) of the U.S. government. 

### Tax Advantages
[Interest](../i/interest.md) earned on 1-Year T-Bills is subject to [federal income](../f/federal_income.md) tax but exempt from state and local [taxes](../t/taxes.md). This can be an important consideration for investors in high-tax states.

### Market Liquidity
The highly [liquid](../l/liquid.md) nature of T-Bills makes them attractive for both trading and investment purposes. The [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md) is highly active, ensuring ease of buying and selling.

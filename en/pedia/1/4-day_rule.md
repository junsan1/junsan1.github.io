# 4-Day Rule

The "4-Day Rule," also known as the "Pattern Day Trader (PDT) Rule," is a regulation established by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ([FINRA](../f/finra.md)) in the United States. This rule mandates that a trader who makes more than three day trades within a rolling five-business-day period is classified as a Pattern Day Trader. This classification has significant implications for the trader's account, primarily pertaining to margin requirements and minimum equity.

## Definition and Importance

### What is a Day Trade?

A day trade pertains to any trade in which a security is bought and then sold (or sold short and then repurchased) within the same trading day. This definition includes all types of securities, such as stocks, options, and ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds).

### Roll of the 4-Day Rule

The 4-Day Rule specifically refers to monitoring the number of day trades within a consecutive five-day period. According to [FINRA](../f/finra.md):
- If a trader executes four or more day trades within five trading days, they are deemed a Pattern Day Trader.
- A Pattern Day Trader must maintain a minimum equity of $25,000 in their trading account.
- This equity must be in cash or eligible securities and must be in the account prior to engaging in any day-trading activities.

## Regulatory Background

The PDT rule was implemented as part of broader efforts to ensure that investors engaged in frequent trading possess sufficient capital to bear the corresponding risks. While this rule aims to protect retail investors from margin calls and other financial difficulties, it also affects individual [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) and algorithms used in trading.

## Implications for Algorithmic Trading

### Capital Requirements

For algorithmic traders, the 4-Day Rule necessitates a higher initial capital outlay. When deploying algorithms designed for [day trading](../d/day_trading.md), traders must ensure their accounts meet the $25,000 minimum equity requirement to comply with the PDT rule. Failure to meet these requirements can result in margin calls or restrictions from [day trading](../d/day_trading.md).

### Strategy Adjustments

Algorithmic strategies must consider the restrictions imposed by the Pattern Day Trader classification. Some common adjustments include:
- **Limiting the number of day trades**: By programming algorithms to restrict day trades to three or fewer within five days, traders can avoid PDT classification.
- **Utilizing larger accounts**: Ensuring the trading account meets or exceeds the $25,000 requirement allows greater flexibility in [day trading](../d/day_trading.md).
- **Switching to [swing trading](../s/swing_trading.md)**: Adjusting algorithms to focus on trades held for more than one day, thereby avoiding rapid buy-sell actions within the same trading period.

## Enforcement and Consequences

[FINRA](../f/finra.md) enforces the 4-Day Rule rigorously. Brokerages must track and report [day trading](../d/day_trading.md) activities to ensure compliance. The consequences for violating this rule can include:
- **Restrictions on trading activity**: Accounts not meeting the minimum equity requirement may be limited to closing transactions only.
- **Suspension of account**: Repeated violations can lead to temporary or permanent suspension from [day trading](../d/day_trading.md) activities under certain brokerages.

## Brokerages and Tools

Various brokerages provide tools and platforms to assist traders in complying with the 4-Day Rule. Examples include:

## Conclusion

The 4-Day Rule, or Pattern Day Trader Rule, symbolizes a critical regulatory framework in the U.S. financial markets. It underscores the importance of adequate capitalization and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) for individuals engaged in frequent trading activities. For algorithmic traders, navigating these regulations requires thoughtful adjustments to [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) and close monitoring of trading activities. The rule aims to fortify market integrity while protecting retail investors from excessive risk, thereby ensuring a balanced and fair [trading environment](../t/trading_environment.md).

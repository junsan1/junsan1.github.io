# 4-Day Rule

The "4-Day Rule," also known as the "[Pattern Day Trader](../p/pattern_day_trader.md) (PDT) Rule," is a regulation established by the Financial [Industry](../i/industry.md) Regulatory Authority ([FINRA](../f/finra.md)) in the United States. This rule mandates that a [trader](../t/trader.md) who makes more than three day trades within a rolling five-[business](../b/business.md)-day period is classified as a [Pattern Day Trader](../p/pattern_day_trader.md). This classification has significant implications for the [trader](../t/trader.md)'s account, primarily pertaining to [margin](../m/margin.md) requirements and minimum [equity](../e/equity.md).

## Definition and Importance

### What is a Day Trade?

A day [trade](../t/trade.md) pertains to any [trade](../t/trade.md) in which a [security](../s/security.md) is bought and then sold (or sold short and then repurchased) within the same trading day. This definition includes all types of securities, such as [stocks](../s/stock.md), [options](../o/options.md), and ETFs ([Exchange](../e/exchange.md)-Traded Funds).

### Roll of the 4-Day Rule

The 4-Day Rule specifically refers to monitoring the number of day trades within a consecutive five-day period. According to [FINRA](../f/finra.md):
- If a [trader](../t/trader.md) executes four or more day trades within five trading days, they are deemed a [Pattern Day Trader](../p/pattern_day_trader.md).
- A [Pattern Day Trader](../p/pattern_day_trader.md) must maintain a minimum [equity](../e/equity.md) of $25,000 in their [trading account](../t/trading_account.md).
- This [equity](../e/equity.md) must be in cash or eligible securities and must be in the account prior to engaging in any day-trading activities.

## Regulatory Background

The PDT rule was implemented as part of broader efforts to ensure that investors engaged in frequent trading possess sufficient [capital](../c/capital.md) to bear the corresponding risks. While this rule aims to protect retail investors from [margin](../m/margin.md) calls and other financial difficulties, it also affects individual [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) and algorithms used in trading.

## Implications for Algorithmic Trading

### Capital Requirements

For algorithmic traders, the 4-Day Rule necessitates a higher initial [capital](../c/capital.md) outlay. When deploying algorithms designed for [day trading](../d/day_trading.md), traders must ensure their accounts meet the $25,000 minimum [equity](../e/equity.md) requirement to comply with the PDT rule. Failure to meet these requirements can result in [margin](../m/margin.md) calls or restrictions from [day trading](../d/day_trading.md).

### Strategy Adjustments

Algorithmic strategies must consider the restrictions imposed by the [Pattern Day Trader](../p/pattern_day_trader.md) classification. Some common adjustments include:
- **Limiting the number of day trades**: By programming algorithms to restrict day trades to three or fewer within five days, traders can avoid PDT classification.
- **Utilizing larger accounts**: Ensuring the [trading account](../t/trading_account.md) meets or exceeds the $25,000 requirement allows greater flexibility in [day trading](../d/day_trading.md).
- **Switching to [swing trading](../s/swing_trading.md)**: Adjusting algorithms to focus on trades held for more than one day, thereby avoiding rapid buy-sell actions within the same trading period.

## Enforcement and Consequences

[FINRA](../f/finra.md) enforces the 4-Day Rule rigorously. Brokerages must track and report [day trading](../d/day_trading.md) activities to ensure compliance. The consequences for violating this rule can include:
- **Restrictions on trading activity**: Accounts not meeting the minimum [equity](../e/equity.md) requirement may be limited to closing transactions only.
- **Suspension of account**: Repeated violations can lead to temporary or permanent suspension from [day trading](../d/day_trading.md) activities under certain brokerages.

## Brokerages and Tools

Various brokerages provide tools and platforms to assist traders in complying with the 4-Day Rule. Examples include:

## Conclusion

The 4-Day Rule, or [Pattern Day Trader](../p/pattern_day_trader.md) Rule, symbolizes a critical regulatory framework in the U.S. [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). It underscores the importance of adequate [capitalization](../c/capitalization.md) and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) for individuals engaged in frequent trading activities. For algorithmic traders, navigating these regulations requires thoughtful adjustments to [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) and close monitoring of trading activities. The rule aims to fortify [market](../m/market.md) integrity while protecting retail investors from excessive [risk](../r/risk.md), thereby ensuring a balanced and fair [trading environment](../t/trading_environment.md).

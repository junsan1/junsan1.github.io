# 10-Bagger

In the realm of stock market investing, the term "10-bagger" was popularized by famed investor Peter Lynch in his seminal book, "One Up On Wall Street." A "10-bagger" is a stock that grows to be worth ten times its initial purchase price. The term borrows from baseball terminology, where a "bag" refers to a base, implying the stock has made it "ten bases" or tenfold its original value.

Investors seek 10-baggers due to their potential for significant capital appreciation. Identifying these stocks early can lead to substantial financial gains and is often considered the "holy grail" for growth investors. They are typically found in emerging industries or among companies with unique products, strong growth prospects, and effective management.

## Origins of the Term

Lynch served as the manager of the Magellan Fund at [Fidelity Investments](../f/fidelity_investments.md) between 1977 and 1990, achieving an average annual return of 29.2%. His success was largely credited to his knack for identifying high-[growth stocks](../g/growth_stocks.md) early, many of which became 10-baggers or even greater.

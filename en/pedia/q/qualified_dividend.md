# Qualified Dividend

A qualified [dividend](../d/dividend.md) is a type of [dividend](../d/dividend.md) that is taxed at the long-term [capital gains tax](../c/capital_gains_tax.md) rates rather than the [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md) tax rates. This preferential tax treatment is one of the incentives provided by the U.S. tax code to encourage investment in corporate [stocks](../s/stock.md). For a [dividend](../d/dividend.md) to be considered "qualified," it must meet specific criteria set forth by the Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Service (IRS). Understanding these criteria and the implications of qualified dividends is critical for individual investors and financial professionals alike. 

## Definition and Tax Implications

A qualified [dividend](../d/dividend.md) is a [payment](../p/payment.md) to shareholders that meets certain criteria to qualify for a lower [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md). Instead of being taxed at [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md) tax rates, which can be as high as 37% for high-[income](../i/income.md) earners as of 2023, qualified dividends are taxed at the more favorable long-term [capital gains tax](../c/capital_gains_tax.md) rates. These rates are either 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on the individual's [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md) and [filing status](../f/filing_status.md).

This preferential tax treatment significantly impacts the after-[tax return](../t/tax_return.md) on investments, making qualified dividends an attractive option for many investors.

## Criteria for Qualified Dividends

The IRS has specified two primary criteria that a [dividend](../d/dividend.md) must meet to be considered "qualified":

### 1. The Holding Period

For the dividends to qualify for the lower [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md), the [investor](../i/investor.md) must [hold](../h/hold.md) the stock for a specific period. Generally, the stock must be held for more than 60 days during the 121-day period that begins 60 days before the [ex-dividend](../e/ex-dividend.md) date. The [ex-dividend](../e/ex-dividend.md) date is the day after which any new buyers of the stock are not entitled to receive upcoming dividends.

This [holding period](../h/holding_period.md) requirement ensures that only [long-term investments](../l/long-term_investments.md) benefit from the preferential tax treatment.

### 2. Type of Payment and Source

The [dividend](../d/dividend.md) must be paid by a U.S. [corporation](../c/corporation.md) or a qualified foreign [corporation](../c/corporation.md). Furthermore, certain types of dividends are not qualified, even if they meet the [holding period](../h/holding_period.md) requirement. These include:

- Dividends paid by [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) investment trusts (REITs).
- Dividends paid by master limited partnerships (MLPs).
- Dividends paid as part of a hedging strategy.
- Payments in lieu of dividends, such as those made by brokers under certain circumstances.

## Examples of Qualified and Non-Qualified Dividends

### Qualified Dividends

- Dividends from blue-chip companies like Apple Inc. (AAPL) or Microsoft [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) (MSFT) are typically qualified, provided that the [shares](../s/shares.md) are held long enough to meet the [holding period](../h/holding_period.md) requirement.
- Dividends paid by a [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md) or an [exchange](../e/exchange.md)-traded [fund](../f/fund.md) (ETF) that invests in [stocks](../s/stock.md) that pay qualified dividends, pass through to the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s shareholders as qualified dividends.

### Non-Qualified Dividends

- Dividends from REITs such as Vanguard [Real Estate](../r/real_estate.md) ETF (VNQ) are usually non-qualified.
- [Income](../i/income.md) distributions from MLPs like Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (EPD) are treated as non-qualified dividends.

## Importance for Investors

The distinction between qualified and non-qualified dividends has a significant impact on an [investor](../i/investor.md)'s [taxes](../t/taxes.md) and overall returns. Here's why it matters:

### 1. Tax Efficiency

Qualified dividends result in lower [taxes](../t/taxes.md) compared to non-qualified dividends. This increases the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s net returns. For example, if you are in the 37% tax bracket but receive a qualified [dividend](../d/dividend.md), you would only pay a maximum of 20% tax on that [dividend](../d/dividend.md) instead of 37%.

### 2. Investment Strategy

Understanding which dividends are qualified can help investors make more informed decisions about their portfolio. For example, if an [investor](../i/investor.md) is focused on tax [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md), they may prefer to invest in companies or funds that pay qualified dividends.

### 3. Retirement Planning

For retirees who rely on dividends as a source of [income](../i/income.md), the lower [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md) on qualified dividends can make a significant difference in their [disposable income](../d/disposable_income.md). Proper planning can help retirees minimize their tax liabilities and make their retirement savings last longer.

## Qualified Dividends and Financial Planning

Financial advisors and planners often emphasize the importance of tax [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) in [portfolio management](../p/par.md). Here are some strategies that can help maximize the benefits of qualified dividends:

### 1. Dividend Growth Investing

[Investing](../i/investing.md) in companies that not only pay dividends but also have a track record of increasing their dividends can provide both [income](../i/income.md) and growth. This approach relies on identifying firms with strong fundamentals and a history of [dividend](../d/dividend.md) increases.

### 2. Tax-Loss Harvesting

This strategy involves selling investments that have lost [value](../v/value.md) to [offset](../o/offset.md) gains from qualified dividends, thereby reducing the overall tax burden.

### 3. Holdings in Tax-Advantaged Accounts

Holding [dividend](../d/dividend.md)-paying [stocks](../s/stock.md) in [tax-advantaged](../t/tax-advantaged.md) accounts such as Roth IRAs or 401(k) plans can shelter the dividends from immediate [taxation](../t/taxation.md), allowing the investments to grow more efficiently. However, care must be taken to not miss the [holding period](../h/holding_period.md) requirement; otherwise, the dividends might not qualify for favorable tax treatment.

## Case Study: Impact of Qualified vs. Non-Qualified Dividends

Let's consider a case study to illustrate the impact of qualified dividends on an [investor](../i/investor.md)'s tax situation.

### Assumptions:

- [Investor](../i/investor.md) A is in the 24% [federal income](../f/federal_income.md) tax bracket.
- [Investor](../i/investor.md) B is in the 35% [federal income](../f/federal_income.md) tax bracket.
- Both investors receive $10,000 in dividends.

#### Scenario 1: Dividends Are Non-Qualified

- [Investor](../i/investor.md) A: $10,000 x 24% = $2,400 in [taxes](../t/taxes.md)
- [Investor](../i/investor.md) B: $10,000 x 35% = $3,500 in [taxes](../t/taxes.md)

#### Scenario 2: Dividends Are Qualified

- [Investor](../i/investor.md) A: $10,000 x 15% = $1,500 in [taxes](../t/taxes.md)
- [Investor](../i/investor.md) B: $10,000 x 15% = $1,500 in [taxes](../t/taxes.md)

### Result

In this case study, [Investor](../i/investor.md) A saves $900 in [taxes](../t/taxes.md) and [Investor](../i/investor.md) B saves a substantial $2,000 due to the lower [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md) on qualified dividends. This clearly demonstrates the tax [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and financial benefit of qualified dividends.

## Conclusion

Qualified dividends, with their preferential tax treatment, [offer](../o/offer.md) significant advantages for investors looking to maximize their after-tax returns. By understanding the criteria that make a [dividend](../d/dividend.md) qualified, the tax implications, and strategies to benefit from such dividends, investors can enhance their [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md) and investment strategies. 

Investors and financial advisors should keep abreast of any changes to tax laws that may impact the status of qualified dividends and revise their strategies accordingly.

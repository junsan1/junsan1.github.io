# Quality Control Charts

[Quality Control](../q/quality_control.md) Charts, also known as control charts or process-behavior charts, are a critical tool in the [quality management](../q/quality_management.md) and improvement process. These charts provide a visual representation of how a process varies over time and help in monitoring, controlling, and enhancing the performance of the process. Introduced by Walter A. Shewhart in the early 1920s, they have since become an essential component of statistical process control (SPC).

## Overview

[Quality Control](../q/quality_control.md) Charts are utilized to determine whether a [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) or [business](../b/business.md) process is in a state of statistical control. These charts track data over time and visualize deviations from the norm, which helps in identifying whether the deviations are caused by random variations (common causes) or identifiable factors (special causes). 

There are various types of control charts, and the choice of chart depends on the type of data being analyzed and the specific quality characteristics being monitored. The two main categories of data are:

1. **Attribute Data:** Data that can be counted for recording and analysis. E.g., the number of defective items in a batch.
2. **Variable Data:** Data that can be measured on a continuous scale. E.g., the time taken to complete a task or the weight of an item.

## Types of Quality Control Charts

### 1. **P-Chart (Proportion Chart)**

The P-Chart is used for monitoring the proportion of defective items in a process. It is applicable when the data is categorical and defects can be counted.

**How it Works:**
- **Sample Proportion (p)**: The proportion of defectives in a sample.
- **Center Line (CL)**: The average proportion of defectives over all samples.
- **Control Limits**: Calculated using the average proportion and [standard error](../s/standard_error.md). They define the boundaries of common cause variation.

### 2. **NP-Chart (Number of Defective Items)**

The NP-Chart monitors the number of defective items, not the proportion, in each sampled subgroup and is suitable for a constant-sized subgroup.

**How it Works:**
- **Sample Count of Defectives (np)**: The actual number of defective items.
- **Center Line**: The average number of defective items.
- **Control Limits**: Similar to the P-Chart but applied to the total count.

### 3. **C-Chart (Count of Defects per Unit)**

The C-Chart is designed for monitoring the number of defects per unit when you can count the number of defects in a constant-size sample.

**How it Works:**
- **Sample Defect Count (c)**: The number of defects in a sample unit.
- **Center Line**: The average number of defects per unit.
- **Control Limits**: Based on the [Poisson distribution](../p/poisson_distribution_in_trading.md) due to the count nature of defects.

### 4. **U-Chart (Defects Per Unit)**

The U-Chart is similar to the C-Chart but is used where the sample size is not constant.

**How it Works:**
- **Defects per Unit (u)**: The average number of defects per unit of measure.
- **Center Line**: The average number of defects per unit.
- **Control Limits**: Takes into account [variability](../v/variability.md) due to different sample sizes.

### 5. **X-Bar and R-Chart (Mean and Range Chart)**

The X-Bar and R-Chart are used for plotting continuous data to monitor the mean (X-Bar) and [range](../r/range.md) (R) of a process when subgroup samples are small (usually n â‰¤ 10).

**How it Works:**
- **X-Bar**: The average of each subgroup.
- **R-Chart**: The [range](../r/range.md) within each subgroup.
- **Center Lines**: The average of the subgroup means and ranges, respectively.
- **Control Limits**: Based on known statistical properties of the [range](../r/range.md) and the mean.

### 6. **X-Bar and S-Chart (Mean and Standard Deviation)**

Similar to the X-Bar and R-Chart, the X-Bar and S-Chart use the [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) instead of the [range](../r/range.md) for larger subgroups.

**How it Works:**
- **X-Bar**: The average of each subgroup.
- **S-Chart**: The [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) of each subgroup.
- **Center Lines and Control Limits**: Derived from statistical properties and used to monitor process control.

## Designing a Quality Control Chart

### Selecting the Appropriate Chart

The first step in creating a control chart is selecting the appropriate chart type based on the nature of the data and the quality attribute being measured. 

1. **Attribute Data:**
   - Use a P-Chart or NP-Chart for categorical data where items are classified as defective or non-defective.
   - Use a C-Chart or U-Chart for count data, where defects are counted per item or per unit of measure.

2. **Variable Data:**
   - Use an X-Bar and R-Chart or X-Bar and S-Chart when monitoring continuous data like time, length, weight, etc.

### Data Collection and Sampling

Data collection is vital for accurately assessing the process behavior. Ensure that the samples are randomly chosen, and the sample size is consistent with the chart type requirements. 

### Creating the Chart

1. **Calculate the Center Line (CL):** Determine the average [value](../v/value.md) for the statistic being monitored.
2. **Determine the Control Limits:**
   - **Upper Control Limit (UCL):** CL + (k * [Standard Error](../s/standard_error.md))
   - **Lower Control Limit (LCL):** CL - (k * [Standard Error](../s/standard_error.md))
   - The constant 'k' is typically 3 for three standard deviations.

3. **Plot the Data:** Plot the actual data points over time.
4. **Interpret the Chart:** Analyze the chart to identify any points beyond the control limits or patterns that suggest a special cause variation.

## Interpretation and Analysis

[Quality Control](../q/quality_control.md) Charts are powerful tools for distinguishing between common cause and special cause variations.

### Common Cause Variation

Common cause variations are inherent in the process and arise from numerous, generally small factors which are always present. If all points fall within the control limits, the process is considered stable and in control.

### Special Cause Variation

Special cause variations are unusual or assignable causes not inherent to the process. These are identified when data points fall outside the control limits or there is a non-random pattern within the control limits.

### Patterns to Watch For

Certain patterns within control charts can indicate issues needing attention:

- **Single point outside control limits:** Immediate investigation needed.
- **Two out of three consecutive points near a control limit:** Potential shift in process.
- **Runs of points on one side of the center line:** Indication of a systematic [issue](../i/issue.md).
- **Cycles or systematic variation:** Could indicate external factors influencing the process.

## Applications in Modern Business and Manufacturing

Control charts are widely used in various industries due to their ability to provide immediate feedback on process performance.

### Manufacturing

In [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md), control charts help monitor process parameters such as dimensions, weights, and defect counts to ensure product quality and consistency.

### Healthcare

In healthcare, control charts can track vital signs, infection rates, and other critical metrics to ensure patient safety and [operational efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md).

### Financial Services

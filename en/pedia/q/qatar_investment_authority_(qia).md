# Qatar Investment Authority (QIA)

The Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) is the sovereign [wealth](../w/wealth.md) [fund](../f/fund.md) of the State of Qatar. Established in 2005 via Emiri decision No. (22), its purpose is to strengthen the country's [economy](../e/economy.md) by diversifying into new [asset](../a/asset.md) classes. QIA seeks to secure Qatar's financial future by minimizing reliance on [hydrocarbon](../h/hydrocarbon.md) reserves and [investing](../i/investing.md) across a diversified set of international and domestic [asset](../a/asset.md) classes. 

QIA is one of the largest sovereign [wealth](../w/wealth.md) funds globally, with an estimated $450 billion of assets under management. It plays a pivotal role in the global financial landscape by making significant [long-term investments](../l/long-term_investments.md). The [fund](../f/fund.md) operates under the highest standards of [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) and ethics, reflecting its commitment to [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and integrity.

## Mission and Strategy

QIA’s mission is to secure and sustain the economic and financial well-being of the State of Qatar. This is achieved through a global portfolio of diversified investments that provide competitive returns while minimizing [risk](../r/risk.md).

The [fund](../f/fund.md) employs a strategic [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) framework that balances growth-oriented investments with safe, stable assets. The allocation includes equities, [fixed income](../f/fixed_income.md), [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), [private equity](../p/private_equity.md), and alternative investments. It targets a mix of geography, sectors, and [asset](../a/asset.md) types to smooth out [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and capture growth opportunities.

Their [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) also takes into account Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) considerations. QIA has committed to responsible investment principles, which not only aim to achieve financial returns but also drive positive, sustainable impact.

QIA's vision can be summarized in three pillars:
1. **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md)** - Reducing reliance on [hydrocarbon](../h/hydrocarbon.md) revenues by [investing](../i/investing.md) in a broad [range](../r/range.md) of [asset](../a/asset.md) classes.
2. **Sustainability** - Ensuring investments are sustainable and socially responsible.
3. **Growth** - Focusing on long-term [value](../v/value.md) creation rather than short-term gains.

- **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: Spreading investments across various geographies, [asset](../a/asset.md) classes, and sectors to minimize idiosyncratic risks.
- **[Due Diligence](../d/due_diligence.md)**: Comprehensive evaluation of potential investments to mitigate risks associated with [market](../m/market.md), operational, and geopolitical factors.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Ongoing review and assessment of the portfolio to ensure alignment with strategic objectives and [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) levels.

## Future Outlook

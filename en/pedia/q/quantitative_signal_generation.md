# **Quantitative Signal Generation**

Quantitative signal generation is a cornerstone concept in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), where mathematical models and statistical techniques are utilized to make trading decisions. This technique involves analyzing historical data and market variables to generate signals that indicate when to buy or sell financial instruments. The adoption of quantitative strategies helps in making systematic, emotion-free decisions and can involve complex methods spanning multiple disciplines, including statistics, econometrics, machine learning, and computer science.

### Evaluation Metrics for Quantitative Signals

Evaluating the effectiveness of quantitative signals is crucial for maintaining robust [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). Some common evaluation metrics include:

1. **Accuracy**
   - The fraction of correct predictions made by the model out of all predictions.
   - Formula: Accuracy = (True Positives + True Negatives) / Total Predictions

2. **Precision**
   - The fraction of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions.
   - Formula: Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)

3. **Recall**
   - The fraction of true positive predictions out of all actual positives.

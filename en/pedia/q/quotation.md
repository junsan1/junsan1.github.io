# Quotation

A quotation in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) typically refers to the last price at which a [security](../s/security.md) or [asset](../a/asset.md) was bought or sold. In the context of trading, quotations also include a [bid](../b/bid.md) and an ask price, representing the highest price a buyer is willing to pay and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept, respectively. 

## Overview

Quotations are essential components of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), [offering](../o/offering.md) [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and insights into [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md), [supply](../s/supply.md), and [demand](../d/demand.md). They are instrumental for traders, brokers, and investors in making informed decisions. Here, we dive deeper into the nuances of quotations, their different forms, their relevance in modern trading, and how they are integral to the financial ecosystem.

## Components of a Quotation

### Bid Price

The [bid price](../b/bid_price.md) is the highest price that a buyer (bidder) is willing to pay for a [security](../s/security.md). It reflects the [demand](../d/demand.md) side of the [market](../m/market.md). A higher [bid price](../b/bid_price.md) indicates a stronger [demand](../d/demand.md) for that [security](../s/security.md).

### Ask Price

The ask price, or [offer](../o/offer.md) price, is the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept for a [security](../s/security.md). It represents the [supply](../s/supply.md) side of the [market](../m/market.md). A lower ask price signifies a readiness among sellers to part with the [security](../s/security.md) at a lower rate.

### Bid-Ask Spread

The difference between the [bid price](../b/bid_price.md) and the ask price is known as the [bid-ask spread](../b/bid-ask_spread.md). This spread is a critical [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of the [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) of a [security](../s/security.md). 

1. **Narrow Spread**: Indicates high [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), meaning there are many buyers and sellers, and the [market](../m/market.md) is highly active.
2. **Wide Spread**: Suggests low [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), meaning fewer transactions are happening, and there may be difficulties in buying or selling without affecting the price.

### Last Price

This is the last traded price of the [security](../s/security.md). It provides an immediate snapshot of the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s most recent [market value](../m/market_value.md).

## Types of Quotations

### Real-Time Quotations

Real-time quotations provide the most current price information, updating instantly as transactions occur. These are crucial for high-frequency trading (HFT) and [algorithmic trading strategies](../a/algorithmic_trading_strategies.md) that depend on millisecond accuracy.

### Delayed Quotations

Delayed quotations, often available for free on many financial news websites, show the prices from a certain number of minutes ago, typically 15-20 minutes. This lag is acceptable for long-term investors but not for day traders.

### Historical Quotations

Historical quotations are records of past prices. They are essential for [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md), where traders study price movements over time to predict future trends. Historical data is also used to backtest [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

## Quotation Systems and Platforms

### Stock Exchanges

Stock exchanges like the New York Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (NYSE), [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md), and London Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (LSE) provide quotations for the [stocks](../s/stock.md) [listed](../l/listed.md) on them. These exchanges have developed various advanced trading platforms that [offer](../o/offer.md) real-time data.

## The Role of Quotation Systems in Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) relies heavily on precise and timely quotations. In high-frequency trading (HFT), algorithms can execute thousands of trades per second based on real-time [quote](../q/quote.md) data. 

### Data Feeds

[Algorithmic trading platforms](../a/algorithmic_trading_platforms.md) need data feeds that [supply](../s/supply.md) continuous streams of [market](../m/market.md) data, including real-time quotes. These feeds use low-latency data transmission methods to ensure rapid delivery, which is paramount for exploiting [market](../m/market.md) inefficiencies.

### Execution Algorithms

[Execution algorithms](../e/execution_algorithms.md) use quotations to decide the optimal price and time to place orders. They ensure minimal [market](../m/market.md) impact and [slippage](../s/slippage.md), which can erode profits.

## Quotation and Market Microstructure

Understanding how quotations work helps in comprehending [market microstructure](../m/market_microstructure.md) - the mechanics of how trades are conducted. 

### Market Making

[Market](../m/market.md) makers provide [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) by quoting both a [bid](../b/bid.md) and an ask price. They [profit](../p/profit.md) from the [bid-ask spread](../b/bid-ask_spread.md) and help ensure that there is always a buyer and a seller for a [security](../s/security.md).

### Order Books

[Order](../o/order.md) books compile all buy and sell orders for a [security](../s/security.md), showing the quantity of [shares](../s/shares.md) at different [bid and ask](../b/bid_and_ask.md) prices. The best [bid and ask](../b/bid_and_ask.md) prices constitute the current [market](../m/market.md) quotation.

## Technological Revolution in Quotations

The advancement of technology has significantly impacted how quotations are generated, disseminated, and utilized.

### Electronic Communication Networks (ECNs)

ECNs facilitate trading of securities by matching buy and sell orders electronically. They allow investors to [trade](../t/trade.md) outside traditional [exchange](../e/exchange.md) hours and provide competitive quotations.

### Blockchain and Digital Trading Platforms

[Blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology offers [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and [security](../s/security.md) in trading. Digital platforms using [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) can provide decentralized quotations free from traditional [market](../m/market.md) disruptions.

## Regulatory Considerations

Quotations are regulated to prevent [fraud](../f/fraud.md) and ensure [transparency](../t/transparency.md).

### Market Transparency

Regulatory bodies like the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) in the US enforce rules for the proper dissemination of quotations. They mandate real-time reporting of trades to ensure [transparency](../t/transparency.md).

### Best Execution

Brokers are required to provide the best possible [execution](../e/execution.md) for their clients' orders. This requirement means striving to obtain the best quotation available at the time of the [trade](../t/trade.md).

## Conclusion

Quotations play a vital role in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), [offering](../o/offering.md) a snapshot of the current [market value](../m/market_value.md) of securities. From real-time updates for high-frequency traders to historical data for long-term investors, quotations facilitate a variety of [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). As technology continues to advance, the accuracy and application of quotations are set to evolve, further integrating into sophisticated [trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md) and platforms. Understanding the mechanics of quotations and their impact on [market microstructure](../m/market_microstructure.md) provides valuable insights for any participant in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

For professionals in the [finance](../f/finance.md) and trading [industry](../i/industry.md), leveraging the full spectrum of quotation data is essential for making informed decisions and maintaining a competitive edge.

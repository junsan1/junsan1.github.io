# Qualified Small Employer Health Reimbursement Arrangement (QSEHRA)

A Qualified Small Employer Health [Reimbursement](../r/reimbursement.md) Arrangement (QSEHRA) is a health benefit for small businesses, which was established under the 21st Century Cures Act in December 2016. It allows eligible small employers to reimburse employees for qualified medical expenses, including monthly [insurance](../i/insurance.md) premiums. This arrangement provides a more flexible and cost-effective way for small businesses to [offer](../o/offer.md) health benefits without the complexity and administrative burden of traditional [group health insurance](../g/group_health_insurance.md) plans.

## Eligibility Criteria
To qualify for a QSEHRA, a small employer must meet specific criteria:

1. **Size of the Employer**: The employer must have fewer than 50 full-time equivalent employees (FTEs). This threshold aligns with the [Affordable Care Act](../a/affordable_care_act.md)'s (ACA) requirement that businesses with 50 or more FTEs must provide [health insurance](../h/health_insurance.md) to their employees.

2. **[Health Insurance](../h/health_insurance.md) Coverage**: The employer cannot [offer](../o/offer.md) a group health plan, which means any form of [health insurance](../h/health_insurance.md) that covers two or more employees (traditional [group health insurance](../g/group_health_insurance.md) plans, Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), or self-insured health plans).

## Key Features of QSEHRA

### Reimbursement Allowance
The amount that an employer can reimburse employees for medical expenses is capped annually. For 2021, the maximum annual [reimbursement](../r/reimbursement.md) limits were $5,300 for self-only coverage and $10,700 for family coverage. These limits are subject to annual adjustments for [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

### Qualified Medical Expenses
Under QSEHRA, employees can be reimbursed for the following types of expenses:
- **[Insurance](../i/insurance.md) Premiums**: Monthly premiums for individual [health insurance](../h/health_insurance.md) policies.
- **Out-of-Pocket Medical Expenses**: Deductibles, co-pays, prescriptions, and other medical expenses defined under IRS §213(d).

### Tax Treatment
- **Employer**: Contributions to a QSEHRA are tax-deductible as a [business](../b/business.md) [expense](../e/expense.md).
- **Employee**: Reimbursements received by employees for qualified medical expenses are not considered [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md), provided they have Minimum Essential Coverage (MEC).

### Reporting Requirements
Employers are required to report the amount of the permitted benefit for each employee on the employee's Form W-2. Additionally, employees must be informed about the QSEHRA in writing, specifying the maximum annual [reimbursement](../r/reimbursement.md), the need to maintain MEC, and the possibility that reimbursements could affect their eligibility for [premium](../p/premium.md) tax credits under ACA.

## Advantages of QSEHRA

1. **[Cost Control](../c/cost_control.md)**: Employers have a predictable and controlled [budget](../b/budget.md) since they define the maximum [reimbursement](../r/reimbursement.md) limit each year.
2. **Flexibility**: Employees can choose health coverage that best suits their needs, enhancing their satisfaction and retention.
3. **Simplified Administration**: Unlike traditional [group health insurance](../g/group_health_insurance.md), QSEHRA does not require dealing with [insurance](../i/insurance.md) carriers or managing complex plan renewal processes.
4. **Employee Retention**: [Offering](../o/offering.md) a health benefit can make small businesses more competitive in attracting and retaining top talent.

## Steps to Set Up a QSEHRA
1. **Design the QSEHRA Plan**: Determine the maximum annual [reimbursement](../r/reimbursement.md) limits and which expenses [will](../w/will.md) be reimbursable.
2. **Provide Written Notice**: Employers must provide employees with a written notice at least 90 days before the start of the plan year.
3. **Set Up a [Reimbursement](../r/reimbursement.md) Process**: Establish a method for employees to submit claims and for reimbursements to be processed.
4. **Maintain Records**: Keep detailed records of all reimbursements made, as well as the employee’s proof of [insurance](../i/insurance.md) coverage.

## Impact on Employees
For employees, a QSEHRA offers financial support in managing healthcare costs. Employees have the freedom to buy [insurance](../i/insurance.md) policies that suit their personal or family needs rather than being restricted to a one-size-fits-all group plan offered by the employer. This flexibility can result in better satisfaction and potentially better health outcomes.

However, employees must ensure they have Minimum Essential Coverage to receive [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md) reimbursements. If an employee purchases a policy from the ACA marketplace, the QSEHRA benefits may affect their eligibility for [premium](../p/premium.md) tax credits.

## Regulatory Compliance
Employers must stay compliant with several regulations and reporting requirements:

- **Written Notice**: In addition to the annual notice, a QSEHRA written notice must be provided to new hires.
- **Form W-2 Reporting**: The total amount of permitted QSEHRA benefits must be reported in Box 12, using code FF.
- **Employee Documentation**: Employers should collect and retain documentation demonstrating that the employee incurred a reimbursable medical [expense](../e/expense.md), such as [receipts](../r/receipt.md) or invoices.

## Case Study: Implementing QSEHRA in a Small Business
### Background
XYZ Tech Solutions, a small technology [startup](../s/startup.md) with 30 employees, realized the burden of [offering](../o/offering.md) a traditional [group health insurance](../g/group_health_insurance.md) plan. Costs were unpredictably rising, and administrative tasks were consuming valuable resources.

### Solution
XYZ Tech Solutions decided to implement a QSEHRA. They set the annual [reimbursement](../r/reimbursement.md) limits to $4,500 for singles and $9,000 for families.

### Implementation
XYZ Tech Solutions provided the required written notice to all employees and set up a simple [reimbursement](../r/reimbursement.md) process using a third-party administrator to [handle](../h/handle.md) claims. Employees were educated about how to submit claims and the importance of maintaining Minimum Essential Coverage.

### Outcome
Employees appreciated the increased flexibility in choosing their health plans, and XYZ Tech Solutions experienced a smoother administrative process and predictable costs. Employee satisfaction and retention improved, benefiting the overall company culture and [productivity](../p/productivity.md).

## Challenges and Considerations
While QSEHRA offers significant benefits, there are some challenges and considerations:

- **Employee Education**: Employees must understand how to use the QSEHRA, the need to maintain MEC, and how reimbursements may affect their [taxes](../t/taxes.md) or other health subsidies.
- **Regulatory Changes**: Employers must stay updated with IRS guidelines and annual adjustments to [reimbursement](../r/reimbursement.md) limits.
- **Administrative Burden**: Although simpler than traditional group [insurance](../i/insurance.md), administering QSEHRA still requires managing claims, ensuring compliance, and proper record-keeping.

## Conclusion
The QSEHRA presents a viable alternative to traditional [group health insurance](../g/group_health_insurance.md) for small businesses, [offering](../o/offering.md) flexibility, [cost control](../c/cost_control.md), and potential tax benefits. By carefully implementing and managing a QSEHRA, small employers can provide meaningful health benefits to their employees, contributing to improved job satisfaction and retention.

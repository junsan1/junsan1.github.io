# QUID (Quasi Universal Intergalactic Denomination)

## Definition
QUID, short for Quasi Universal Intergalactic [Denomination](../d/denomination.md), is a space [currency](../c/currency.md) concept developed by scientists and economists. While not a [functional currency](../f/functional_currency.md), it represents a theoretical approach to interplanetary [commerce](../c/commerce.md) and financial transactions in space exploration scenarios.

## Key Characteristics

### 1. Material Composition
- Made from a polymer material, similar to many modern banknotes
- Designed to withstand extreme temperatures and cosmic radiation

### 2. Denominations
- Comes in different denominations, each with a unique shape and color
- Shapes are designed to be easily distinguishable in zero-gravity environments

### 3. Security Features
- Incorporates advanced anti-counterfeiting measures
- Includes embedded identification chips for tracking and verification

### 4. Universal Design
- Created to be recognizable and usable by various potential alien species
- Utilizes mathematical symbols and astronomical imagery instead of human-centric designs

## Conceptual Applications

### 1. Space Tourism
- Potential use in future commercial space travel
- Could serve as a souvenir or collectible item for space tourists

### 2. Interplanetary Trade
- Theoretical [medium of exchange](../m/medium_of_exchange.md) for [commerce](../c/commerce.md) between Earth and future space colonies
- Designed to facilitate transactions in various gravitational environments

### 3. Space Mission Logistics
- Potential use in compensating astronauts or settling accounts in long-term space missions
- Could serve as a standardized [value](../v/value.md) system for resource allocation in space

## Advantages

1. **Durability**: Designed to withstand extreme space conditions
2. **Universality**: Attempts to create a [currency](../c/currency.md) concept not tied to any single planet or species
3. **Innovation**: Encourages thinking about financial systems beyond Earth-bound concepts

## Limitations

1. **Theoretical Nature**: Currently exists only as a concept, not a [functional currency](../f/functional_currency.md)
2. **Earth-Centric Design**: Despite attempts at universality, still based on human understanding of [commerce](../c/commerce.md)
3. **Practicality**: Electronic or digital currencies might be more practical for actual space use

## Historical Context
- Developed in 2007 by scientists from the National Space Centre and the University of Leicester
- Part of a broader discussion on the [economics](../e/economics.md) of space exploration and potential future scenarios

## Cultural Impact
- Has been featured in discussions about future space [economics](../e/economics.md)
- Serves as an educational tool to spark [interest](../i/interest.md) in space science and [economics](../e/economics.md) among students and the public

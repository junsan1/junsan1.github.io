# Qualified Electric Vehicle

A Qualified Electric Vehicle (QEV) is a term used in the automotive and transportation sectors, particularly in the context of environmental regulations, tax incentives, and subsidies. This designation is often used by government agencies to identify electric vehicles (EVs) that meet specific standards related to emissions, energy [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md), safety, and other regulatory criteria. The concept of a Qualified Electric Vehicle encompasses various types of electric vehicles, including Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), and, in some contexts, even Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles (FCVs).

## Types of Qualified Electric Vehicles

### Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)
Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) are fully electric vehicles that rely solely on electricity stored in onboard batteries to power the electric motor(s). BEVs do not have an internal combustion engine (ICE) and produce zero tailpipe emissions. Instead, they utilize large battery packs that can be recharged via external electric power sources, such as [home](../h/home.md) charging stations or public charging points.

Common examples of BEVs include:
- Tesla Model S, Model 3, Model X, and Model Y
- Nissan Leaf
- Chevrolet Bolt EV
- Hyundai Kona Electric

### Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)
Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) combine an internal combustion engine with an electric motor and a battery pack. PHEVs can operate in both electric-only [mode](../m/mode.md) and hybrid [mode](../m/mode.md) (utilizing both the electric motor and the internal combustion engine). The battery pack of a PHEV can be recharged through external sources, similar to BEVs. This dual propulsion system extends the driving [range](../r/range.md) and offers an added level of flexibility compared to BEVs.

Common examples of PHEVs include:
- Toyota Prius Prime
- Chevrolet Volt (discontinued but still notable)
- Ford Fusion Energi
- BMW 330e

### Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles (FCVs)
Although less common, some regulatory frameworks also include Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles (FCVs) under the umbrella of Qualified Electric Vehicles. FCVs generate electricity onboard from hydrogen gas through a chemical reaction in a fuel cell. The resulting electricity powers an electric motor, and the only byproduct is water vapor, making FCVs zero-emission vehicles as well.

Common examples of FCVs include:
- Toyota Mirai
- Hyundai Nexo
- Honda Clarity Fuel Cell

## Regulatory and Incentive Frameworks

### United States
In the United States, the Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Service (IRS) provides tax credits for QEVs under the Qualified Plug-In Electric Drive Motor Vehicle [Credit](../c/credit.md) (IRC 30D). This federal [tax credit](../t/tax_credit.md) can be worth up to $7,500 depending on the capacity of the battery. However, it phases out after a manufacturer sells 200,000 qualifying vehicles.

### Europe
In Europe, various countries have introduced subsidies, tax reductions, and incentives to encourage the adoption of QEVs. In Norway, for instance, Electric Vehicles are exempt from most [taxes](../t/taxes.md), including VAT and [import](../i/import.md) duties. In Germany, buyers can get a [subsidy](../s/subsidy.md) of up to €9,000 for electric vehicles.

### China
China offers substantial incentives to purchase electric vehicles, including subsidies, reductions in the purchase tax, and registration priority. The Chinese government aims to ensure that New Energy Vehicles (NEVs), which include BEVs and PHEVs, make up at least 20% of the country's new car sales by 2025.

## Environmental Impact 

Qualified Electric Vehicles are key players in the global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. By transitioning from fossil fuel-dependent ICEs to electric and hydrogen fuel cell systems, QEVs help lower the carbon footprint of the [transportation sector](../t/transportation_sector.md). However, the overall environmental benefit also depends on the energy sources used to generate the electricity or hydrogen.

### Life Cycle Assessment 
The environmental impact of QEVs is often evaluated using [Life Cycle](../l/life_cycle.md) Assessment (LCA), which takes into account the emissions and energy consumption throughout the vehicle's lifecycle—from production to disposal. 

#### Production
The production phase for QEVs, especially BEVs, can be more energy-intensive and produce higher emissions due to the [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) of battery packs. However, advances in battery technology and recycling methods are gradually mitigating these impacts.

#### Operation
During the operation phase, BEVs have a significant advantage because they produce zero tailpipe emissions. The environmental benefit for PHEVs and FCVs, during this phase, depends on factors like the electricity grid mix and hydrogen production methods (e.g., whether the hydrogen is produced via electrolysis using renewable energy).

#### End-of-Life 
The end-of-life phase includes the recycling and potential second-life applications of battery packs. Efficient and sustainable recycling methods are essential to minimize the environmental impact linked to the disposal of battery packs.

## Technological Advancements

### Battery Technology
Advancements in battery technology—such as the development of solid-state batteries, improved energy densities, and faster charging times—are pivotal in enhancing the performance and viability of BEVs. Prominent companies in this space include:

- Tesla's Gigafactory (https://www.tesla.com/gigafactory)
- QuantumScape (https://www.quantumscape.com)
- CATL (Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited) (http://www.catl.com)

### Charging Infrastructure
The [expansion](../e/expansion.md) of charging [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) is crucial for the widespread adoption of BEVs and PHEVs. Companies and organizations are [investing](../i/investing.md) heavily in expanding reliable and fast-charging networks:

- ChargePoint (https://www.chargepoint.com)
- EVgo (https://www.evgo.com)
- Ionity (https://ionity.eu)

### Hydrogen Technology
For FCVs, advancements in hydrogen production, storage, and refueling [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) are essential. The focus is on producing green hydrogen using renewable energy sources to further reduce environmental impact. Notable entities in hydrogen technology include:

- Plug Power (https://www.plugpower.com)
- Ballard Power Systems (https://www.ballard.com)
- Nikola [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) (https://nikolamotor.com)

## Economic Considerations

### Cost of Ownership
The Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for QEVs can be lower than conventional ICE vehicles due to lower fuel and maintenance costs. However, the higher initial purchase price remains a barrier, albeit one that is gradually diminishing with advancements in technology and [economies of scale](../e/economies_of_scale.md).

### Market Trends
The [market](../m/market.md) for Qualified Electric Vehicles continues to grow rapidly as technological advancements, regulatory frameworks, and consumer [demand](../d/demand.md) drive adoption.

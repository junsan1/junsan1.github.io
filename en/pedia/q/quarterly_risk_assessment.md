# Quarterly Risk Assessment

## Introduction
**Quarterly Risk Assessment (QRA)** in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) is a crucial practice aimed at managing and mitigating risks that arise from the deployment of automated [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). This assessment is performed every quarter to identify potential vulnerabilities, evaluate the performance of [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md), ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, and make necessary adjustments to minimize financial losses. 

## Key Components of QRA

### 1. Risk Identification
Risk identification involves analyzing both internal and external factors that could negatively impact [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). It encompasses a wide range of risks, including market risk, [liquidity risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md), operational risk, compliance risk, and technology risk.

#### Market Risk
Market risk arises from changes in market prices, such as stock prices, interest rates, or foreign exchange rates. These fluctuations can lead to significant losses if the algorithms are not properly calibrated to handle such volatility.

#### Liquidity Risk
[Liquidity risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md) refers to the potential difficulty in executing trades at desired prices due to insufficient market depth. This risk is particularly relevant for algorithms trading in less liquid assets.

#### Operational Risk
Operational risk encompasses failures related to internal processes, people, and systems. In [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), this includes software bugs, hardware malfunctions, and human errors during strategy implementation.

#### Compliance Risk
Compliance risk is associated with not adhering to regulatory requirements. In [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), this could involve violating market manipulation rules or failing to maintain proper records.

#### Technology Risk
Technology risk encompasses potential issues arising from the reliance on technology infrastructure, such as system downtime, cyberattacks, and connectivity problems.

### 2. Risk Measurement
Risk measurement involves quantifying the identified risks to understand their potential impact on [trading performance](../t/trading_performance.md). Common metrics used in risk measurement include Value at Risk (VaR), Expected Shortfall (ES), and [stress testing](../s/stress_testing_in_trading.md).

#### Value at Risk (VaR)
VaR measures the maximum potential loss of a portfolio over a given time frame with a specified confidence level. It is widely used in the financial industry to gauge market risk.

#### Expected Shortfall (ES)
ES, also known as Conditional VaR, provides an estimate of the expected loss beyond the VaR threshold. It offers a more comprehensive view of [tail risk](../t/tail_risk.md).

#### Stress Testing
[Stress testing](../s/stress_testing_in_trading.md) involves simulating extreme market conditions to assess the robustness of [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md). This helps in understanding the potential impact of severe market shocks.

### 3. Risk Mitigation
Risk mitigation involves implementing strategies to reduce the identified risks. This may include diversifying [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), setting stop-loss limits, using hedge instruments, and regularly updating algorithms to adapt to changing market conditions.

#### Diversification
Diversification involves deploying a variety of [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) across different asset classes and market conditions to minimize the impact of any single adverse event.

#### Stop-Loss Limits
Setting stop-loss limits ensures that trades are automatically closed when losses reach a predetermined threshold, limiting potential losses.

#### Hedging
Hedging involves taking offsetting positions in related assets to reduce the overall risk exposure of the portfolio.

#### Algorithm Updates
Regularly updating and [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) helps ensure they remain effective under current market conditions and incorporate any new data or market trends.

### 4. Performance Evaluation
Performance evaluation assesses the effectiveness of the risk mitigation strategies and the overall performance of the [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md). This includes reviewing key [performance indicators](../p/performance_indicators.md) (KPIs), conducting attribution analysis, and comparing actual versus expected outcomes.

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
KPIs such as [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md), [Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md), and [Information Ratio](../i/information_ratio.md) are used to evaluate the risk-adjusted performance of the [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md).

#### Attribution Analysis
Attribution analysis helps in understanding the contribution of different factors to the overall performance. This includes analyzing the impact of market trends, stock selection, and [algorithm efficiency](../a/algorithm_efficiency.md).

#### Actual vs. Expected Outcomes
Comparing the actual performance with the expected outcomes helps in identifying any discrepancies and areas for improvement. This analysis is critical for refining the algorithms and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) strategies.

### 5. Compliance Review
Compliance review ensures that the trading activities adhere to regulatory standards and internal policies. This involves regular audits, maintaining proper documentation, and staying updated with regulatory changes.

#### Audits
Internal and external audits help in verifying that the trading activities are compliant with industry regulations and internal [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) policies.

#### Documentation
Maintaining comprehensive and accurate documentation of trading activities is essential for regulatory compliance and risk assessment.

#### Regulatory Updates
Staying informed about changes in regulations and implementing necessary updates to the [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) strategies is crucial for ongoing compliance.

# Qualified Professional Asset Manager (QPAM)

**Qualified Professional [Asset](../a/asset.md) Manager (QPAM)** is a designation in the financial and [asset management](../a/asset_management.md) [industry](../i/industry.md), referring to certain entities that have the experience, expertise, and regulatory approval to manage assets on behalf of clients, particularly in the context of the Employee Retirement [Income](../i/income.md) [Security](../s/security.md) Act (ERISA) of 1974 in the United States. This designation is crucial for entities managing retirement plans and other types of employee benefit plans, as it allows them to engage in transactions that might otherwise be prohibited under ERISA’s stringent rules. Below, we [will](../w/will.md) delve into the details of what a QPAM is, the regulatory background, qualifications required, benefits, and implications for [asset management](../a/asset_management.md).

## Regulatory Background

The **Employee Retirement [Income](../i/income.md) [Security](../s/security.md) Act (ERISA)** was enacted to protect the interests of participants in employee benefit plans, including retirement and health plans. Under ERISA, fiduciaries are prohibited from engaging in certain transactions that could be deemed self-dealing or conflicted. However, these rules can be overly restrictive, potentially hindering legitimate and beneficial transactions.

To address this [issue](../i/issue.md), the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) issued Prohibited [Transaction](../t/transaction.md) [Exemption](../e/exemption.md) 84-14 (PTE 84-14), commonly known as the QPAM [Exemption](../e/exemption.md). This [exemption](../e/exemption.md) allows QPAMs to engage in certain transactions on behalf of ERISA plans that would otherwise be prohibited, provided certain conditions are met. This regulatory framework aims to provide flexibility while ensuring the protection of plan participants.

## Qualifications of a QPAM

To qualify as a QPAM, [asset](../a/asset.md) managers must meet specific criteria set forth by the DOL. These criteria include:

1. **Size and Experience Requirements**: The [asset](../a/asset.md) manager must have significant assets under management and a [robust](../r/robust.md) track record. Specifically, to qualify, an [asset](../a/asset.md) manager must:
   - Manage at least $85 million in assets.
   - Maintain at least $1 million in shareholders' or partners' [equity](../e/equity.md).
2. **Independence**: The QPAM must be independent of the plan sponsor to avoid conflicts of [interest](../i/interest.md).
3. **Registration**: The entity must be registered under applicable securities laws, such as being a registered [investment advisor](../i/investment_advisor.md) under the [Investment Advisers Act of 1940](../i/investment_advisers_act_of_1940.md).
4. **Professionalism and Expertise**: The entity must have substantial experience and expertise in [asset management](../a/asset_management.md) to ensure they can act in the best interests of the plans they manage.

## Benefits of the QPAM Designation

The QPAM designation brings several advantages to both [asset](../a/asset.md) managers and the clients they serve. These include:

1. **Enhanced [Transaction](../t/transaction.md) Flexibility**: QPAMs can engage in transactions such as buying and selling assets and entering into investment contracts that would otherwise be prohibited under ERISA, allowing for more dynamic [portfolio management](../p/par.md).
2. **Credibility and [Trust](../t/trust.md)**: Being designated as a QPAM signals a high level of professionalism and regulatory compliance, enhancing [trust](../t/trust.md) with clients.
3. **Attraction of [Business](../b/business.md)**: The ability to [handle](../h/handle.md) ERISA-regulated assets broadens the client base an [asset](../a/asset.md) manager can serve, including large corporate retirement plans and other employee benefit plans.
4. **[Operational Efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md)**: The exemptions provided under PTE 84-14 streamline compliance and reduce the administrative burden for [asset](../a/asset.md) managers, allowing them to focus more on investment strategies and less on regulatory constraints.

## Implications for Asset Management

The QPAM designation has several implications for the broader [asset management](../a/asset_management.md) [industry](../i/industry.md):

### Fiduciary Standards

QPAMs are held to high fiduciary standards to ensure they act in the best interests of plan participants and beneficiaries. This involves prudent decision-making and the avoidance of conflicts of [interest](../i/interest.md). The fiduciary responsibilities of a QPAM include:

- Performing duties with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence that a prudent person familiar with such matters would use.
- Diversifying plan investments to minimize the [risk](../r/risk.md) of large losses.
- Adhering to the terms of the plan documents insofar as they are consistent with ERISA.

### Risk Management

The ability of QPAMs to engage in [exempt transactions](../e/exempt_transaction.md) under ERISA can help improve [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices by allowing for a broader [range](../r/range.md) of investment opportunities and strategies. This flexibility can lead to better diversified portfolios and enhanced [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted returns, benefiting both plan sponsors and participants.

### Market Practices

The QPAM [exemption](../e/exemption.md) has influenced [market](../m/market.md) practices by enabling the development of more sophisticated investment products and strategies tailored to ERISA plans. This includes [structured finance](../s/structured_finance.md) products, [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), and [private equity](../p/private_equity.md) investments that require careful regulatory navigation.

### Compliance and Monitoring

Compliance with QPAM requirements involves stringent monitoring and reporting to ensure ongoing adherence to the conditions of PTE 84-14. This includes maintaining detailed records of transactions and demonstrating continued compliance with size and independence criteria. Many [asset](../a/asset.md) managers invest heavily in compliance [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) and employ dedicated compliance officers to oversee these activities.

### Legal and Regulatory Developments

The landscape of regulations governing QPAMs is subject to change, with the DOL periodically reviewing and updating requirements to address new [market](../m/market.md) developments and potential risks. [Asset](../a/asset.md) managers must stay informed about legal and regulatory changes to maintain their QPAM status and avoid potential penalties.

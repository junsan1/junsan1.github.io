# Qualified Mortgage

A **Qualified [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) (QM)** refers to a category of loans that have certain, more stable features that help make it more likely that a consumer [will](../w/will.md) be able to afford their [loan](../l/loan.md). Under U.S. federal law, this concept was introduced by the [Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act](../d/dodd-frank_wall_street_reform_and_consumer_protection_act.md). [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) lenders, as mandated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), are obliged to follow specific rules when determining if a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) qualifies as a QM. These rules are designed to protect consumers from risky [loan](../l/loan.md) features and to ensure that lenders conduct a meaningful assessment of a borrower's ability to repay the [loan](../l/loan.md).

## Key Characteristics of a Qualified Mortgage

1. **[Debt](../d/debt.md)-to-[Income](../i/income.md) Ratio**: One of the [principal](../p/principal.md) features of a Qualified [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) is the limit on the borrower’s [debt](../d/debt.md)-to-[income](../i/income.md) (DTI) ratio. This ratio should generally be 43% or less for a [loan](../l/loan.md) to be considered a Qualified [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md).
2. **No Toxic [Loan](../l/loan.md) Features**:
    - **No [Interest](../i/interest.md)-Only Periods**: Loans where the borrower only pays [interest](../i/interest.md) without reducing the [loan](../l/loan.md) [principal](../p/principal.md).
    - **No [Negative Amortization](../n/negative_amortization.md)**: Loans where the [principal](../p/principal.md) amount increases over time, even when payments are made on time.
    - **No Balloon Payments**: Large, one-time payments at the end of the [loan](../l/loan.md) term are forbidden with certain exceptions.
3. **Term Limitations**: The [loan](../l/loan.md) term should not exceed 30 years.
4. **Points and Fees Limitation**: Points and fees must be below 3% of the [loan](../l/loan.md) amount for loans of $100,000 or more. Smaller loans have greater flexibility.
5. **Documentation and Verification**: Lenders must thoroughly document and verify a borrower’s [income](../i/income.md), assets, and liabilities.

## Importance of Qualified Mortgages

The primary aim of QM is to ensure that loans are more stable and secure both for consumers and the broader [financial system](../f/financial_system.md). By eliminating high-[risk](../r/risk.md) [loan](../l/loan.md) features and ensuring that lenders take [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md) in verifying a borrower’s ability to repay, QMs help mitigate the [risk](../r/risk.md) of defaults and foreclosures. This contributes to a more stable housing [market](../m/market.md) and a more resilient [financial system](../f/financial_system.md).

The concept of Qualified Mortgages underscored the broader effort of financial reforms initiated post the 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md), focusing on ensuring responsible lending practices.

## Types of Qualified Mortgages

There are several types of Qualified Mortgages, including:

1. **General QM**: General QM loans follow the guidelines set forth by the Ability-to-Repay (ATR) rule, which include the cap on DTI ratio and verification of [income](../i/income.md)/[credit](../c/credit.md) history.
2. **GSE-Eligible QM**: Loans eligible for purchase by Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) like Fannie Mae or [Freddie Mac](../f/freddie_mac.md), qualifying under their respective [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) guidelines.
3. **Small [Creditor](../c/creditor.md) QM**: This category allows certain smaller lenders who underwrite loans to retain slightly more leniencies with the [provision](../p/provision.md) that loans stay within certain limits.
4. **Seasoned QM**: A recent addition allows a non-QM [loan](../l/loan.md) to be reclassified as a QM after exhibiting a good [payment](../p/payment.md) history for a set period, usually three years.

## Legal and Regulatory Framework

The **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)** is the primary regulatory authority overseeing the implementation and compliance of Qualified [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) rules. They [issue](../i/issue.md) regular guidelines and updates to address the evolving [market](../m/market.md) conditions and to improve consumer protections. The QM rule forms part of a broader regulatory framework, which includes the Ability-to-Repay rule.

### Ability-to-Repay (ATR) Rule

The ATR rule requires lenders to make a good-faith effort to determine if a consumer can repay a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) before it’s approved. It obliges lenders to verify a borrower’s financial information and consider factors such as [income](../i/income.md), assets, debts, and [credit](../c/credit.md) history. Lenders must keep records showing they have made an ATR determination and consumers can sue lenders for failing to prove compliance with this rule.

### Dodd-Frank Act

The QM concept was introduced by the **[Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act](../d/dodd-frank_wall_street_reform_and_consumer_protection_act.md)**. The Act was enacted in response to the 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md), aiming to prevent the recurrence of such an economic breakdown. It introduced significant changes to financial regulation and [credit](../c/credit.md) requirements.

## Effect on Borrowers and Lenders

For **borrowers**, Qualified Mortgages provide [assurance](../a/assurance.md) that the [loan](../l/loan.md) terms are less risky and that the [lender](../l/lender.md) has assessed their ability to repay. This helps prevent over-borrowing and reduces the [risk](../r/risk.md) of [foreclosure](../f/foreclosure.md). 

For **lenders**, originating a QM protects them from certain legal liabilities under the ATR rule. If a [lender](../l/lender.md) makes a QM, they are given a presumption, or even a safe harbor, that they have met the ATR requirements. This reduces the chances of costly litigation.

## Challenges and Criticisms

Despite its benefits, the QM rule has faced criticisms and brought several challenges:

1. **Stringent Requirements**: The strict criteria and documentation requirements may exclude certain borrowers, particularly those who are self-employed or have non-traditional [income](../i/income.md) sources.
2. **Complexity**: The QM rules add layers of complexity and increased compliance costs for lenders.
3. **[Loan](../l/loan.md) Accessibility**: Some argue that QM rules, while protective, could make it harder for qualified borrowers to access [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [credit](../c/credit.md).

## Recent Developments

In recent years, the CFPB has considered adjustments to the QM rule to reflect changes in the housing [market](../m/market.md) and [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md). For instance, the expiration of the GSE Patch (which allowed loans eligible for purchase by Fannie Mae and [Freddie Mac](../f/freddie_mac.md) to be QM regardless of the DTI ratio) prompted discussions on adjusting the DTI threshold and other criteria. 

Additionally, the introduction of the Seasoned QM rule aims to provide a pathway for high-performing non-QM loans to [gain](../g/gain.md) QM status, thereby increasing the [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and marketability of such loans.

## Conclusion

Qualified Mortgages play a crucial role in ensuring the stability and sustainability of the residential [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [market](../m/market.md). By enforcing stringent lending standards and focusing on the borrower’s ability to repay, they mitigate risks for both borrowers and lenders. The continuous evolution of QM guidelines reflects an ongoing commitment to balancing consumer protection with [market](../m/market.md) growth and accessibility.

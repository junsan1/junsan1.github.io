# Qtum

Qtum (pronounced "Quantum") is a [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) platform that merges the reliability of [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md)'s [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) model with the back-end technology of [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md). Its primary aim is to provide a versatile, secure, and scalable solution for businesses and developers who want to [leverage](../l/leverage.md) the advantages of [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology. Launched in 2017, Qtum has gained prominence as an innovative platform that combines elements from both [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) and [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) to create a hybrid solution tailored for a wide array of decentralized applications (dApps).

## Foundation and Background

Qtum was founded by Patrick Dai, Jordan Earls, and Neil Mahi and is currently maintained by the Qtum Foundation, which is registered in Singapore. The project's mainnet was launched in September 2017 following a successful Initial Coin [Offering](../o/offering.md) (ICO) that raised $15.6 million. The platform was conceptualized to integrate the best features of the two leading [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) networks, [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) and [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md), to create a more flexible and scalable [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md).

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Underlying Technology

Qtum combines [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md)’s [UTXO](../u/utxo.md) (Unspent [Transaction](../t/transaction.md) Output) model with [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md)'s Virtual Machine (EVM). The [UTXO](../u/utxo.md) model is renowned for its simplicity and [security](../s/security.md), while the EVM facilitates smart contract [execution](../e/execution.md). This unique combination enables Qtum to support complex dApps while maintaining high [transaction](../t/transaction.md) [throughput](../t/throughput.md) and [robust](../r/robust.md) [security](../s/security.md).

### 2. Account Abstraction Layer (AAL)

The Account Abstraction Layer is a unique feature of Qtum that serves as a bridge between the [UTXO](../u/utxo.md) model and the EVM. It abstracts the complexities of these two systems, allowing developers to build applications without needing to understand the intricate details of how the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) operates. This layer also ensures that Qtum can integrate future technologies and updates from both [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) and [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) with minimal disruption.

### 3. Decentralized Governance Protocol (DGP)

Qtum incorporates a Decentralized Governance Protocol that allows for [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) parameters like block size and gas fees to be altered without the need for a hard fork. This is achieved through [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md) that adjust the parameters based on proposals and votes from the community. The DGP enhances the platform's adaptability and reduces the [risk](../r/risk.md) of network splits.

### 4. Proof-of-Stake Consensus Mechanism

Unlike [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md)’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm, Qtum uses Proof-of-Stake (PoS). This shift not only reduces the computational resources required but also enhances network [security](../s/security.md) and promotes decentralization. In PoS, the probability of validating a new block is proportional to the number of tokens a node holds and is willing to "stake" as [collateral](../c/collateral.md).

### 5. x86 Virtual Machine

In addition to EVM, Qtum is developing its x86 Virtual Machine, which aims to provide a more versatile and developer-friendly environment for [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md). The x86 VM supports [multiple](../m/multiple.md) programming languages, higher performance, and a more flexible [execution](../e/execution.md) model, which could potentially expand the ecosystem by attracting more developers.

## Use Cases

Qtum’s flexible architecture enables a wide [range](../r/range.md) of applications across various industries:

### 1. Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

Qtum supports various DeFi applications like decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending platforms, and synthetic [asset](../a/asset.md) issuance. Its compatibility with [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md)'s ERC20 tokens and [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md) makes it easier for DeFi projects to port their applications to Qtum.

### 2. Supply Chain Management

The [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md)’s [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and immutability make it ideal for [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md) management. Companies can use Qtum to track the provenance of goods, streamline [logistics](../l/logistics.md), and ensure the authenticity of products.

### 3. Internet of Things (IoT)

Qtum's scalable and low-latency network is well-suited for IoT applications. Devices can execute [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md) directly on the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md), ensuring secure and automated interactions between different IoT devices.

### 4. Governance

Qtum's DGP and smart contract capabilities make it a suitable platform for digital governance solutions. Municipalities and organizations can use Qtum to implement transparent voting systems, manage identities, and streamline bureaucratic processes.

### 5. Gaming

The platform also sees applications in the gaming [industry](../i/industry.md) for creating decentralized game economies, enabling in-game [asset](../a/asset.md) trading, and ensuring fair play through [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md).

## Strategic Partnerships

Qtum has formed several strategic partnerships to broaden its [scope](../s/scope.md) and enhance its technological capabilities:

- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: Qtum partners with AWS to provide [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md)-as-a-service (BaaS) solutions to enterprises, allowing them to develop, deploy, and manage [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) applications using AWS [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md).
- **Google Cloud**: Collaboration with Google Cloud enables Qtum to [offer](../o/offer.md) cloud-based [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) services, improving accessibility and [scalability](../s/scalability.md) for developers.
- **Baofeng Bokocloud**: Partnership with Baofeng Bokocloud to integrate Qtum’s [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology into the Baofeng entertainment ecosystem, enabling [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and [security](../s/security.md) for digital content [distribution](../d/distribution.md).

## Community and Ecosystem

Qtum has a vibrant and growing community of developers, token holders, and enthusiasts. The Qtum Foundation actively engages with the community through various channels like Telegram, Twitter, Reddit, and their official forums. They host regular meetups, hackathons, and conferences to foster engagement and innovation within the ecosystem.

### Development and Grant Programs

The Qtum Foundation runs various [grant](../g/grant.md) programs to incentivize developers and startups to build on the Qtum platform. These programs provide financial support, technical resources, and mentorship to promising projects, thereby nurturing a [robust](../r/robust.md) ecosystem.

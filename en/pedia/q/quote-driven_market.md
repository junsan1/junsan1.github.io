# Quote-Driven Market

A [quote](../q/quote.md)-driven [market](../m/market.md), also known as a [dealer market](../d/dealer_market.md), is a type of financial [market](../m/market.md) where prices are determined by dealers who [offer](../o/offer.md) buy and sell quotes for specific quantities of securities. In such a [market](../m/market.md), buyers and sellers do not directly interact with each other but instead execute trades through the dealers, who act as intermediaries. This structure contrasts with [order-driven markets](../o/order-driven_markets.md), where prices are determined by the buy and sell orders submitted by participants directly.

## Characteristics of Quote-Driven Markets

### Dealer's Role
In a [quote](../q/quote.md)-driven [market](../m/market.md), dealers (or [market](../m/market.md) makers) are pivotal. They continuously provide [bid](../b/bid.md) (buy) and ask (sell) quotes, ensuring [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) in the [market](../m/market.md). Unlike participants in [order-driven markets](../o/order-driven_markets.md) who can submit orders at any price, dealers in [quote](../q/quote.md)-driven markets are required to [quote](../q/quote.md) both a [bid](../b/bid.md) and an ask price, making a two-way [market](../m/market.md).

### Bid and Ask Spread
The difference between the [bid and ask](../b/bid_and_ask.md) price is known as the spread. The spread is a key source of [profit](../p/profit.md) for dealers because they buy from customers at the [bid price](../b/bid_price.md) and sell to them at the asking price. A narrower spread indicates a more competitive [market](../m/market.md) which benefits traders by reducing [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md).

### Liquidity
[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) in a [quote](../q/quote.md)-driven [market](../m/market.md) is primarily provided by the dealers. Their role as buyers and sellers of last resort ensures that there is always some level of [market](../m/market.md) activity. This is particularly advantageous in less [liquid](../l/liquid.md) markets, where large [gaps](../g/gap.md) between buy and sell orders could otherwise occur.

### Price Determination
Prices in [quote](../q/quote.md)-driven markets are determined by the interaction of the quotes provided by the dealers. When a [trade](../t/trade.md) is executed, the [transaction](../t/transaction.md) price is the [dealer](../d/dealer.md)'s [quoted price](../q/quoted_price.md). In contrast, in [order-driven markets](../o/order-driven_markets.md), prices are determined by the highest [bid](../b/bid.md) and the lowest ask from the [order book](../o/order_book.md).

### Transparency
[Quote](../q/quote.md)-driven markets typically have lower [transparency](../t/transparency.md) compared to [order-driven markets](../o/order-driven_markets.md). In an [order](../o/order.md)-driven [market](../m/market.md), the [order book](../o/order_book.md) displaying all the buy and sell orders is visible to participants. In a [quote](../q/quote.md)-driven [market](../m/market.md), only the quotes of the dealers are visible, which could lead to less price [transparency](../t/transparency.md) for traders.

## Examples of Quote-Driven Markets

### NASDAQ
One of the most well-known [quote](../q/quote.md)-driven markets is the [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md) [stock market](../s/stock_market.md). Initially, dealers on [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md), referred to as [market](../m/market.md) makers, were responsible for providing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and facilitating trades. They provide continuous quotes for the securities they cover, ensuring that investors can always buy or sell those securities. Although [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md) has evolved to include features of [order-driven markets](../o/order-driven_markets.md), its foundational structure remains [quote](../q/quote.md)-driven.

To understand more about how [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md) operates, you can visit their official website: [NASDAQ](https://www.nasdaq.com/).

### Foreign Exchange (Forex) Market
Another prime example of a [quote](../q/quote.md)-driven [market](../m/market.md) is the [foreign exchange](../f/foreign_exchange.md) (Forex) [market](../m/market.md), where banks and other financial institutions act as dealers. In the Forex [market](../m/market.md), [currency](../c/currency.md) pairs are traded, and the dealers provide the [bid and ask](../b/bid_and_ask.md) prices for these pairs. The Forex [market](../m/market.md) is one of the largest and most [liquid](../l/liquid.md) [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) globally, facilitated by numerous dealers operating across different time zones.

### Over-the-Counter (OTC) Markets
OTC markets, where [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), and other financial instruments are traded directly between parties, are often [quote](../q/quote.md)-driven. In these markets, dealers facilitate trades and provide quotes for the securities. OTC markets lack a centralized [exchange](../e/exchange.md), making the role of dealers crucial for providing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and [price discovery](../p/price_discovery.md).

## Advantages of Quote-Driven Markets

### Ensured Liquidity
A significant advantage of [quote](../q/quote.md)-driven markets is the guaranteed [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) provided by dealers. This is particularly beneficial for securities that do not [trade](../t/trade.md) frequently or in significant volumes.

### Price Continuity
Because dealers are required to [quote](../q/quote.md) both [bid and ask](../b/bid_and_ask.md) prices continuously, [quote](../q/quote.md)-driven markets tend to have better price continuity. This reduces the probability of sudden price jumps and improves overall [market](../m/market.md) stability.

### Facilitated Large Trades
Dealers can facilitate large trades by committing their [capital](../c/capital.md), which might be difficult to execute smoothly in an [order](../o/order.md)-driven [market](../m/market.md) due to the lack of immediate counterparties.

### Lower Price Volatility
The presence of dealers who can provide consistent [bid and ask](../b/bid_and_ask.md) quotes can help to dampen [volatility](../v/volatility.md), making the [market](../m/market.md) less susceptible to sharp price swings. This can be particularly important during periods of high [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) or low [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).

## Disadvantages of Quote-Driven Markets

### Wider Spreads
One of the biggest drawbacks of [quote](../q/quote.md)-driven markets is the potential for wider [bid](../b/bid.md)-ask [spreads](../s/spreads.md). Dealers aim to make a [profit](../p/profit.md) through the spread, which can increase [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md) for traders.

### Potential for Decreased Fairness
In [quote](../q/quote.md)-driven markets, dealers have the power to set prices, which could lead to situations where prices do not necessarily reflect the true [market value](../m/market_value.md) of the [security](../s/security.md). This contrasts with the [price discovery](../p/price_discovery.md) process in [order-driven markets](../o/order-driven_markets.md), which is more transparent and competitive.

### Conflict of Interest
Dealers, while providing a service, might also have conflicts of [interest](../i/interest.md) as they are trading for their accounts. Their quotes could be influenced by their positions, potentially leading to biased pricing.

### Transparency Issues
[Quote](../q/quote.md)-driven markets often suffer from lower [transparency](../t/transparency.md) in terms of [order](../o/order.md) flow and pricing compared to [order-driven markets](../o/order-driven_markets.md). This can lead to information asymmetry where certain participants have more information than others, potentially putting retail investors at a disadvantage.

## Algorithmic Trading in Quote-Driven Markets

### Market Making Algorithms
[Market making algorithms](../m/market_making_algorithms.md) are vital in a [quote](../q/quote.md)-driven [market](../m/market.md). These algorithms place both buy and sell orders to capture the [bid-ask spread](../b/bid-ask_spread.md), ensuring continuous [market](../m/market.md) presence and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md). They [leverage](../l/leverage.md) statistical models to predict short-term price movements and adjust quotes dynamically to manage [inventory](../i/inventory.md) [risk](../r/risk.md) and [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on price inefficiencies.

### Arbitrage Strategies
[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategies can also be effectively employed in [quote](../q/quote.md)-driven markets to exploit price discrepancies. For instance, statistical [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) involves using complex algorithms to identify and exploit small price differences between related securities or markets. This helps to maintain price [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) across markets.

### Latency Arbitrage
In fast-moving markets, latency [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategies can take advantage of the time delay between different [market](../m/market.md) centers. Algorithms can monitor quotes across different platforms and execute trades based on minor latency differences to capture [risk](../r/risk.md)-free profits.

### Liquidity Providing Algorithms
These algorithms aim to provide [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) by continuously [offering](../o/offering.md) to buy and sell securities even in volatile conditions. By adjusting quotes based on real-time [market](../m/market.md) conditions, [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)-providing algorithms help to stabilize markets and facilitate smoother trading.

## Regulatory Considerations 

### Best Execution
Regulators often impose best [execution](../e/execution.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md) to ensure that customers receive the most favorable terms. In [quote](../q/quote.md)-driven markets, dealers must ensure that their quotes are competitive and reflect fair [market value](../m/market_value.md) to comply with best [execution](../e/execution.md) norms.

### Transparency Requirements
To improve [transparency](../t/transparency.md), some regulatory bodies require dealers to disclose their quotes and [transaction](../t/transaction.md) prices. This can help to protect investors and foster [trust](../t/trust.md) in the [market](../m/market.md) but may also reduce dealers' willingness to provide [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) due to increased operational burdens.

### Surveillance and Reporting
Regular monitoring and reporting by regulators ensure that [quote](../q/quote.md)-driven markets operate fairly and transparently. This can include requirements for dealers to report transactions and maintain records that can be audited to prevent [market](../m/market.md) abuses.

## Conclusion

[Quote](../q/quote.md)-driven markets play a crucial role in financial systems by providing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and facilitating efficient trading of securities. Despite some disadvantages such as wider [spreads](../s/spreads.md) and lower [transparency](../t/transparency.md), their ability to maintain [market](../m/market.md) stability and ensure continuous [trade](../t/trade.md) flow makes them indispensable, particularly in less [liquid](../l/liquid.md) or volatile markets. As technology continues to evolve, [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) has become integral in [quote](../q/quote.md)-driven markets, optimizing [liquidity provision](../l/liquidity_provision.md), minimizing [spreads](../s/spreads.md), and enhancing overall [market efficiency](../m/market_efficiency.md). Understanding the intricacies of [quote](../q/quote.md)-driven markets is essential for anyone involved in financial trading or [market](../m/market.md) analysis, as these markets fundamentally shape the dynamics of securities trading globally.

# Quantitative Momentum Strategies

Momentum investing is a financial strategy that aims to capitalize on the continuance of existing trends in the market. This strategy is based on the premise that stocks that have performed well in the past will continue to do well in the future, and those that have performed poorly will continue to decline. [Quantitative momentum](../q/quantitative_momentum.md) strategies, in particular, leverage [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md) and statistical techniques to identify and invest in securities that exhibit strong momentum.

### Definition and Basics

Momentum in finance typically refers to the rate of acceleration of a security's price or the relative strength of a security's price. [Quantitative momentum](../q/quantitative_momentum.md) strategies specifically use historical data to identify and respond to momentum signals. Generally, these strategies involve the following steps:

1. **Data Collection:** Gathering historical price data for a broad set of securities.
2. **Signal Generation:** Computing momentum signals, such as past returns over different time horizons.
3. **Stock Selection:** Based on computed signals, selecting stocks that show strong [positive momentum](../p/positive_momentum.md).
4. **Portfolio Construction:** Allocating capital to the selected stocks while considering factors like [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) and transaction costs.
5. **Trading and Rebalancing:** Implementing buy/sell decisions and periodically rebalancing the portfolio to maintain the desired momentum exposure.

### Types of Momentum

Momentum strategies can be broadly categorized into two types:

1. **Absolute Momentum:** Also known as "time-series momentum," this strategy involves evaluating the past performance of a security and investing if its performance exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., a positive return over the past 12 months). If the past performance is below the threshold, the strategy would either short the security or move the capital to a risk-free asset.
  
2. **Relative Momentum:** Also termed "cross-sectional momentum," this strategy involves ranking a universe of securities based on their past performance and investing in the top performers. For example, if analyzing the S&P 500, the strategy might involve going long on the top 20% of stocks with the highest past returns and shorting the bottom 20%.

### Key Concepts and Metrics

1. **Look-back Period:** The time frame over which past returns are measured. Common look-back periods range from 3 to 12 months.
2. **Holding Period:** The duration for which the assets are held once selected. Many strategies rebalance monthly or quarterly.
3. **Signal Strength:** The magnitude of past returns used to rank the securities.
4. **Volatility Adjustment:** Modifying momentum signals by incorporating volatility measures to reduce the risk associated with high momentum stocks.
5. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md):** Techniques such as diversification, volatility targeting, and [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md) used to manage potential downsides.

### Empirical Evidence

Numerous academic studies support the efficacy of momentum strategies. For example, Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) showed that a strategy of buying past winners and selling past losers generated significant positive returns. Similarly, Asness, Moskowitz, and Pedersen (2013) demonstrated that momentum strategies worked across different asset classes and geographic regions.

### Practical Applications

#### Implementation in Funds

Several investment funds and ETFs incorporate momentum strategies to construct their portfolios. Examples include:

- **AQR Capital Management:** AQR offers funds such as the AQR Large Cap Momentum Style Fund, focusing on [large-cap stocks](../l/large_cap_stocks.md) exhibiting strong momentum. More details can be found at [AQR Capital Management](https://www.aqr.com/).

- **iShares Edge MSCI USA [Momentum Factor](../m/momentum_factor.md) ETF (MTUM):** This ETF aims to track an index that targets U.S. large- and mid-capitalization stocks with high momentum characteristics. More information can be found on the [iShares website](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239726/ishares-msci-usa-momentum-factor-etf).

#### Quantitative Models

Numerous [quantitative models](../q/quantitative_models.md) have been developed to optimize momentum strategies:
- **The [Dual Momentum](../d/dual_momentum.md) Model:** Developed by Gary Antonacci, this model combines absolute and relative momentum, enhancing returns while reducing risk. More details can be found in his book "[Dual Momentum](../d/dual_momentum.md) Investing" and on his website [Optimal Momentum](https://optimalmomentum.com/).

### Challenges and Considerations

1. **Turnover and Transaction Costs:** High turnover rates can lead to significant transaction costs, which may erode returns.
2. **Market Impact:** Large trades can move the market, particularly in less liquid stocks, adversely affecting the entry and exit prices.
3. **Regime Change:** Momentum strategies can suffer during market regime changes, such as sudden shifts from bull to bear markets.

### Conclusion

[Quantitative momentum](../q/quantitative_momentum.md) strategies rely on systematic approaches to harness the persistence of trends in financial markets. By integrating [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md), empirical evidence, and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) techniques, these strategies offer a compelling framework for investors seeking to leverage momentum. However, like all investment strategies, they require careful consideration of transaction costs, market impacts, and changing market conditions.

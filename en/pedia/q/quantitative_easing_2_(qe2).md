# Quantitative Easing 2 (QE2)

[Quantitative Easing](../q/quantitative_easing.md) 2 (QE2) refers to the second round of a [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) instrument called [quantitative easing](../q/quantitative_easing.md) (QE) implemented by the Federal Reserve (Fed), which is the central [bank](../b/bank.md) of the United States. QE2 was launched in November 2010 in response to the global [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) of 2007-2008 and the subsequent economic slump. The primary goal of QE2 was to stimulate [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) and reduce [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) by increasing the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) and lowering long-term [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

## What is Quantitative Easing?

[Quantitative easing](../q/quantitative_easing.md) involves the central [bank](../b/bank.md) purchasing long-term securities, such as government bonds, from the [open market](../o/open_market.md) in [order](../o/order.md) to inject [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) directly into the [economy](../e/economy.md). This process raises the prices of these securities, thereby lowering their yields and reducing long-term [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. By doing so, QE aims to encourage borrowing, investment, and consumption, ultimately fostering [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md).

Unlike traditional [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md), which typically targets short-term [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, QE focuses on long-term rates to impact the broader [economy](../e/economy.md). QE becomes particularly relevant when short-term rates are already close to zero, a situation known as the [zero lower bound](../z/zero_lower_bound.md), limiting the effectiveness of conventional policy tools.

### How QE2 Came About

The first round of [quantitative easing](../q/quantitative_easing.md) (QE1), initiated in December 2008, involved the Fed purchasing $1.75 trillion in [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-backed securities and Treasury bonds. While QE1 helped stabilize [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and prevent a deeper [recession](../r/recession.md), the [economic recovery](../e/economic_recovery.md) remained sluggish, with high [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) rates and low [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

By mid-2010, concerns grew that the U.S. [economy](../e/economy.md) was at [risk](../r/risk.md) of slipping into a deflationary spiral, characterized by falling prices and further economic [stagnation](../s/stagnation.md). In response, the Federal [Open Market](../o/open_market.md) Committee (FOMC), the policymaking arm of the Fed, decided to implement a second round of [quantitative easing](../q/quantitative_easing.md) known as QE2.

## Implementation of QE2

QE2 officially began in November 2010, when the Fed announced its plan to purchase $600 billion in long-term Treasury securities over an eight-month period, concluding in June 2011. The purchases were to be made at a rate of about $75 billion per month.

Additionally, the Fed communicated that it would reinvest the proceeds from maturing securities in its portfolio back into long-term Treasuries. This [reinvestment](../r/reinvestment.md) strategy was aimed at maintaining the overall size of the Fed's [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) and continuing to exert downward pressure on long-term [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

### Objectives of QE2

The main objectives of QE2 were:

1. **Lower Long-Term [Interest](../i/interest.md) Rates:** By purchasing long-term Treasury securities, the Fed aimed to push down long-term [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, making borrowing cheaper for businesses and individuals.
2. **Stimulate Investment and Consumption:** Lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates were expected to encourage businesses to invest in new projects and expansions, and consumers to spend more on big-ticket items such as homes and cars.
3. **Support [Financial Markets](../f/financial_market.md):** QE2 aimed to boost [financial asset](../f/financial_asset.md) prices, such as [stocks](../s/stock.md) and bonds, by increasing [demand](../d/demand.md) for these assets. Higher [asset](../a/asset.md) prices could improve household [wealth](../w/wealth.md) and confidence, further supporting consumer spending.
4. **Prevent [Deflation](../d/deflation.md):** By increasing the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md), QE2 sought to counter deflationary pressures and maintain [inflation](../i/inflation.md) at a level consistent with the Fed's long-term target of around 2%.

## Economic Impact of QE2

### Short-Term Effects

The immediate impact of QE2 was felt in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). Treasury yields fell, with the [yield](../y/yield.md) on the [10-year Treasury note](../1/10-year_treasury_note.md) declining from around 2.6% in early November 2010 to approximately 1.9% by mid-2011. Lower yields on Treasury bonds prompted investors to seek higher returns in other [asset](../a/asset.md) classes, leading to increases in stock prices and [corporate bond](../c/corporate_bond.md) prices.

Additionally, the U.S. dollar weakened relative to other major currencies, as the increase in [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) reduced its [value](../v/value.md). This [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) made U.S. exports more competitive in global markets, potentially supporting [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md).

### Medium- and Long-Term Effects

While QE2 succeeded in lowering long-term [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and boosting [asset](../a/asset.md) prices, its impact on the broader [economy](../e/economy.md) was more mixed. Some of the key outcomes included:

- **Moderate [Economic Growth](../e/economic_growth.md):** The U.S. [economy](../e/economy.md) experienced moderate growth in the years following QE2, with gross domestic product (GDP) increasing at an annual rate of around 2-3%. However, this growth was still considered below potential, and the recovery remained uneven.
- **Improved Employment:** Although the [unemployment rate](../u/unemployment_rate.md) gradually declined from its post-crisis peak of 10% in October 2009 to around 8.5% by the end of 2011, job creation remained sluggish, and many workers faced long-term [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md).
- **[Inflation](../i/inflation.md):** QE2 helped prevent [deflation](../d/deflation.md), with [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rising moderately towards the Fed's target. However, [inflation](../i/inflation.md) remained subdued and well within the Fed's comfort zone, indicating that QE2 did not lead to runaway price increases.

### Criticisms and Controversies

QE2 faced several criticisms from economists, policymakers, and [market](../m/market.md) participants. Some of the main points of contention included:

1. **Limited Effectiveness:** Critics argued that QE2 had a limited impact on the real [economy](../e/economy.md), particularly in terms of job creation and sustainable growth. They contended that the benefits of lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates were [offset](../o/offset.md) by structural issues such as weak consumer [demand](../d/demand.md) and a lack of [business](../b/business.md) confidence.
2. **[Asset](../a/asset.md) [Bubbles](../b/bubble.md):** Some analysts warned that QE2 could create [asset](../a/asset.md) [bubbles](../b/bubble.md) by artificially inflating the prices of [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, and other financial assets. They feared that these [bubbles](../b/bubble.md) could eventually burst, leading to financial instability.
3. **[Income Inequality](../i/income_inequality.md):** There were concerns that QE2 disproportionately benefited wealthy investors and financial institutions, while providing limited support to ordinary households. The increase in [asset](../a/asset.md) prices primarily benefited those who already owned financial assets, potentially exacerbating [income](../i/income.md) and [wealth](../w/wealth.md) inequality.
4. **Global Impact:** QE2 had significant spillover effects on the global [economy](../e/economy.md). The [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) of the U.S. dollar put pressure on emerging [market](../m/market.md) economies, leading to [capital](../c/capital.md) inflows and [currency](../c/currency.md) appreciation. Some countries accused the Fed of engaging in a "[currency](../c/currency.md) war" by devaluing the dollar to [gain](../g/gain.md) a [competitive advantage](../c/competitive_advantage.md) in [trade](../t/trade.md).

## Conclusion

[Quantitative Easing](../q/quantitative_easing.md) 2 (QE2) was a bold and unconventional [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) measure aimed at supporting the U.S. [economic recovery](../e/economic_recovery.md) in the aftermath of the global [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md). While QE2 succeeded in lowering long-term [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, boosting [asset](../a/asset.md) prices, and preventing [deflation](../d/deflation.md), its impact on the broader [economy](../e/economy.md) was more nuanced and subject to debate.

The mixed results of QE2 highlighted the limitations of [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) in addressing deep-seated economic issues and underscored the need for complementary fiscal and structural policies to achieve sustainable growth and [full employment](../f/full_employment.md). Despite the controversies and criticisms, QE2 remains a significant chapter in the history of central banking and continues to inform debates on the role of [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) in modern economies.

# Quarterly Revenue Growth

Quarterly [revenue](../r/revenue.md) growth is a key financial metric that indicates the percentage increase or decrease in a company's [revenue](../r/revenue.md) from one fiscal quarter to the next. Understanding this metric is essential for investors, analysts, and [business](../b/business.md) professionals who aim to gauge a company's [financial health](../f/financial_health.md), performance, and future potential. This discussion delves into various aspects of quarterly [revenue](../r/revenue.md) growth, including its calculation, importance, influencing factors, and implications for different stakeholders.

## Definition and Calculation

Quarterly [revenue](../r/revenue.md) growth is calculated as the [percentage change](../p/percentage_change.md) in [revenue](../r/revenue.md) between two consecutive quarters. The formula to calculate quarterly [revenue](../r/revenue.md) growth is:

\[ \text{Quarterly [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Growth (\%)} = \left( \frac{\text{[Revenue](../r/revenue.md)}_\text{Current Quarter} - \text{[Revenue](../r/revenue.md)}_\text{Previous Quarter}}{\text{[Revenue](../r/revenue.md)}_\text{Previous Quarter}} \right) \times 100 \]

Where:
- \( \text{[Revenue](../r/revenue.md)}_\text{Current Quarter} \) is the [revenue](../r/revenue.md) reported by the company for the current quarter.
- \( \text{[Revenue](../r/revenue.md)}_\text{Previous Quarter} \) is the [revenue](../r/revenue.md) reported by the company for the previous quarter.

For example, if a company reports $200 million in [revenue](../r/revenue.md) for Q1 and $180 million in [revenue](../r/revenue.md) for Q4 of the previous year, the quarterly [revenue](../r/revenue.md) growth would be:

\[ \left( \frac{200 - 180}{180} \right) \times 100 = 11.11\% \]

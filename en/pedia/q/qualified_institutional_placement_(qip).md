# Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP)

Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP) is a [capital](../c/capital.md)-raising tool primarily used in India that allows publicly [listed](../l/listed.md) companies to raise funds by selling [shares](../s/shares.md) or other securities to qualified institutional buyers (QIBs). It is a mechanism to bring [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and swiftness to the [capital](../c/capital.md)-raising process while safeguarding the interests of smaller investors from significant dilutive impacts.

Unlike other [capital](../c/capital.md)-raising tools like Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) or rights issues, QIP has a set of distinctive characteristics and regulatory frameworks which make it a preferred choice for many large corporations. The tool is regulated by the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) Board of India (SEBI), which introduced it to simplify the complexities and red tape traditionally involved in other stock issuance methods.

## Characteristics of QIP

### 1. **Eligibility Criteria**
   - **Issuers**: Only publicly [listed](../l/listed.md) companies are eligible to use QIP for fundraising.
   - **Investors**: Only Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs) can participate in a QIP. QIBs include mutual funds, foreign institutional investors, banks, [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies, pension funds, and more.

### 2. **Regulatory Framework**
   SEBI regulates QIPs to ensure [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and protect [investor](../i/investor.md) interests:
   - Companies must adhere to the SEBI ([Issue](../i/issue.md) of [Capital](../c/capital.md) and [Disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) Requirements) Regulations, 2018.
   - Mandatory lock-in period: [Shares](../s/shares.md) allotted via QIP are subject to a minimum lock-in period of one year to avoid immediate selling in the [market](../m/market.md).
   - [Disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) requirements: Companies must provide detailed disclosures regarding the use of funds and other financial metrics.

### 3. **Pricing Mechanism**
   Under SEBI guidelines, the floor price for QIP [shares](../s/shares.md) must be the average of the weekly high and low of the closing prices of the [shares](../s/shares.md) during the two weeks preceding the relevant date. However, a [discount](../d/discount.md) of up to 5% on this price is allowed.

### 4. **Restrictions**
   - A company can raise a maximum of five times its annual free [float](../f/float.md) [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) through QIP.
   - No QIP can be offered by companies [listed](../l/listed.md) on an SME [exchange](../e/exchange.md).

### 5. **Process**
   - **Approval**: First, the issuing company’s board must approve the QIP. This is followed by the shareholders' approval by special resolution.
   - **[Due Diligence](../d/due_diligence.md)**: Conducted by merchant bankers to ensure full compliance with SEBI norms.
   - **[Offering](../o/offering.md)**: Once the QIP is structured, the issuing company offers [shares](../s/shares.md) to QIBs.

### 6. **Advantages**
   - **[Efficiency](../e/efficiency.md)**: The process is faster and involves fewer regulatory hurdles compared to an IPO.
   - **Cost-Effective**: Lower costs are associated with [marketing](../m/marketing.md) and [issue](../i/issue.md) management as it targets a specific [investor](../i/investor.md) segment.
   - **Flexibility**: Issuers can raise funds as required without diluting the control significantly.
   - **Credibility**: The participation of institutional investors adds credibility to the issuing company.

## Functioning of QIP

A typical flow for executing a QIP involves several steps:
   
1. **Pre-[Issue](../i/issue.md) Procedure**:
   - The company analyzes [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements and evaluates the prospects of raising funds via QIP.
   - Board and shareholders' approvals are required as per regulatory norms.
   - Appointment of lead managers and underwriters to conduct [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md).

2. **[Offer](../o/offer.md) Document**:
   - Preparation of an [offer](../o/offer.md) document, which is less exhaustive compared to an IPO document. It includes essential details about the [offer](../o/offer.md) and the company, ensuring compliance with SEBI requirements.
   
3. **Pricing and Allocation**:
   - Setting the floor price; can be adjusted by a [discount](../d/discount.md) of up to 5%.
   - Allocation of [shares](../s/shares.md) happens through a [price discovery](../p/price_discovery.md) process based on [investor](../i/investor.md) [demand](../d/demand.md).

4. **Post-[Issue](../i/issue.md) Compliances**:
   - Mandatory disclosures about the funds raised and their intended use must be made to SEBI.
   - Regular reporting to ensure [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and adherence to regulatory norms.

## Case Studies

### 1. **Reliance Industries QIP**
   In 2020, Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) raised over $7 billion through a QIP. This was the largest QIP in India at the time and marked a significant step in enhancing RIL’s [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) position for its ambitious digital and retail expansions.

### 2. **State Bank of India QIP**
   In 2018, the State [Bank](../b/bank.md) of India (SBI) raised approximately $2 billion via QIP. The funds were aimed at bolstering its [Tier 1 capital](../t/tier_1_capital.md) and supporting growth amidst rising NPAs (Non-Performing Assets).

## Conclusion

Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP) is a highly effective mechanism for large companies to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) efficiently and cost-effectively, while [offering](../o/offering.md) institutional investors a competitive opportunity to invest in [robust](../r/robust.md) businesses. It streamlines the complicated process of fundraising while ensuring [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and relatively quick access to [capital](../c/capital.md). Given its clear advantages, QIP remains a popular choice among [listed](../l/listed.md) companies in India for their funding needs.

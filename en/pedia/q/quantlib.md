2. **[Interest Rate Models](../i/interest_rate_models.md)**: Comprehensive support for various [interest rate models](../i/interest_rate_models.md) such as Hull-White, Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR), and Black-Karasinski.
3. **[Fixed Income Analysis](../f/fixed_income_analysis.md)**: Functionality for [bond](../b/bond.md) pricing, [yield curve](../y/yield_curve.md) construction, and [fixed income](../f/fixed_income.md) analytics.
4. **Monte Carlo Simulations**: Advanced [Monte Carlo simulation](../m/monte_carlo_simulation.md) capabilities for option pricing and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md).
5. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Tools for calculating [risk metrics](../r/risk_metrics.md) such as [Value](../v/value.md) at [Risk](../r/risk.md) (VaR) and [Greeks](../g/greeks.md).
6. **[Market](../m/market.md) Models**: Support for [market](../m/market.md) models including the LIBOR [Market](../m/market.md) Model (LMM).
7. **[Optimization](../o/optimization.md) Tools**: [Optimization](../o/optimization.md) algorithms for calibrating models and optimizing portfolios.
8. **Financial Calculators**: A [range](../r/range.md) of financial calculators for performing day count conventions, [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) calculations, and more.
9. **Extensible Framework**: Modular and extensible design allowing users to add custom instruments and models.
10. **Cross-Platform Support**: Available on [multiple](../m/multiple.md) platforms including Windows, Linux, and macOS.

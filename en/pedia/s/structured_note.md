# Structured Note

Structured notes are financial instruments designed by financial institutions to provide returns based on the performance of one or more [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets. These assets can include traditional securities like [stocks](../s/stock.md) or bonds, indices, [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, commodities, FX rates, or even various combinations of these. Structured notes combine the features of investment with complex derivates, often seeking to provide solutions tailored to specific [investor](../i/investor.md) needs, [offering](../o/offering.md) features such as [principal](../p/principal.md) protection, enhanced returns, or some form of structured [payout](../p/payout.md) according to a particular [market](../m/market.md) strategy.

## Basic Structure

At their core, structured notes typically consist of two components:
1. **[Fixed Income](../f/fixed_income.md) Instrument ([Bond](../b/bond.md) Component):** This part usually involves a [zero-coupon bond](../z/zero-coupon_bond.md) that ensures the [return](../r/return.md) of the [principal](../p/principal.md) at [maturity](../m/maturity.md).
2. **[Derivative](../d/derivative.md) Component:** This part is linked to the performance of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)(s) and determines any additional [return](../r/return.md) beyond the [principal](../p/principal.md) protection.

Imagine a structured [note](../n/note.md) with a maturation period of five years, tied to the performance of the S&P 500. If the [index](../i/index.md) has appreciated after five years, the [investor](../i/investor.md) receives part of the growth. If the [index](../i/index.md) declines, the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s [principal](../p/principal.md) is still protected, but they may not receive any [return](../r/return.md) over the [principal](../p/principal.md).

## Types of Structured Notes

Structured notes can vary substantially in their design and objectives, but common types include:

1. **[Principal](../p/principal.md) Protected Notes:** These [offer](../o/offer.md) a guarantee of the [principal](../p/principal.md) amount invested, regardless of the performance of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets.

2. **[Yield](../y/yield.md) Enhancement Notes:** These are designed to [offer](../o/offer.md) higher returns, usually by taking on additional [risk](../r/risk.md). They might provide high yields if a particular [asset](../a/asset.md) performs within a specified [range](../r/range.md) but may lead to losses if not.

3. **Participative Notes:** These provide a direct participation in the performance of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets, [offering](../o/offering.md) returns based on relative movements in the [asset](../a/asset.md) prices.

4. **Leveraged Notes:** These use [leverage](../l/leverage.md) to amplify the returns (or losses) tied to the performance of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets.

5. **Hybrid Notes:** These are combinations of [multiple](../m/multiple.md) notes or structures designed to achieve a particular financial goal. These can be extremely complex, combining features of [fixed income](../f/fixed_income.md), [options](../o/options.md), and other [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md).

## Use Cases

Structured notes are typically employed by investors seeking unique solutions to specific financial challenges which ordinary investments can't provide. Here are some examples:
* **[Market](../m/market.md) Access:** Structured notes can provide exposure to markets or assets that might be otherwise difficult to access.
* **Customized [Risk](../r/risk.md)/[Return](../r/return.md) Profiles:** They can be designed to match particular [risk](../r/risk.md) appetites or [return](../r/return.md) requirements.
* **Potential for Enhanced Yields:** By leveraging [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), they can potentially [offer](../o/offer.md) better returns than traditional investments.
* **Downside Protection:** Some notes [offer](../o/offer.md) protection of [principal](../p/principal.md), provided the [note](../n/note.md) is held to [maturity](../m/maturity.md).

## Key Considerations

[Investing](../i/investing.md) in structured notes requires careful consideration due to their intricate nature and potential risks:
1. **[Credit Risk](../c/credit_risk.md):** Since the notes are issued by financial institutions, the [investor](../i/investor.md) is exposed to the [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) of the [issuer](../i/issuer.md).
2. **[Liquidity Risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md):** Structured notes may have limited secondary markets, making them illiquid.
3. **Complexity:** The structure of the notes and the [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) that comprise them can be complex and may not be fully understood.
4. **Fees and Costs:** The costs involved in creating structured notes can be high, and thus fees can erode potential returns.
5. **Performance [Risk](../r/risk.md):** The actual [return](../r/return.md) on the [note](../n/note.md) depends significantly on the performance of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets.

## Example

Consider an [investor](../i/investor.md) wishing to invest in a structured [note](../n/note.md) issued by JPMorgan Chase linked to the [Euro](../e/euro.md) Stoxx 50 [Index](../i/index.md). The [note](../n/note.md) guarantees the [return](../r/return.md) of the [principal](../p/principal.md) at [maturity](../m/maturity.md) plus a percentage of the [index](../i/index.md)'s [gain](../g/gain.md) over a specified period.

- **[Principal](../p/principal.md) Guarantee:** Assume an investment of $1000.
- **[Duration](../d/duration.md):** 5 Years.
- **[Euro](../e/euro.md) Stoxx 50 Performance:** 30% increase over five years.
- **[Payout](../p/payout.md) Structure:** 80% of the [index](../i/index.md) [gain](../g/gain.md).

Thus, ignoring fees and costs:
- **Guaranteed [Principal](../p/principal.md) [Return](../r/return.md):** $1000.
- **Additional Returns:** 30% x 80% x $1000 = $240.
- **Total [Payout](../p/payout.md) at [Maturity](../m/maturity.md):** $1240.

If the [index](../i/index.md) had instead declined, the [investor](../i/investor.md) would still get their $1000 [principal](../p/principal.md) [return](../r/return.md), provided the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) doesn't [default](../d/default.md).

## Regulatory Considerations

The issuance and trading of structured notes are subject to various regulatory provisions, which may vary by jurisdiction. In the United States, for instance, the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) and Financial [Industry](../i/industry.md) Regulatory Authority (FINRA) oversee structured notes, ensuring that they meet specific standards and that investors are adequately informed about their risks and features.

## Leading Issuers

Several major financial institutions are prominent in the structured [note](../n/note.md) [market](../m/market.md). JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley are a few top issuers. They [offer](../o/offer.md) a wide [range](../r/range.md) of structured notes catering to different [investor](../i/investor.md) needs and [market](../m/market.md) views.

## Conclusion

Structured notes can be an attractive and flexible component of an [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md), [offering](../o/offering.md) the potential for tailored [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md) profiles suited to specific needs. However, their complexity and the risks involved require a deep understanding and careful consideration before [investing](../i/investing.md). They are best suited for sophisticated investors who can appreciate their nuances and [leverage](../l/leverage.md) their benefits effectively.

Their design capability offers broad potential applications, ranging from [capital](../c/capital.md) protection to [yield](../y/yield.md) enhancement, enabling investors to construct a portfolio to meet their personalized financial goals under varying [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

# Swing Trade Setups

[Swing trading](../s/swing_trading.md) is a style of trading that attempts to capture short- to medium-term gains in a stock (or any [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md)) over a period of a few days to several weeks. Swing traders primarily use [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) due to the short-term nature of their trades, but they may also use [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md) or a combination of both to make their trading decisions.

Swing [trade](../t/trade.md) setups can vary in complexity, but there are several common patterns and indicators that traders frequently use to identify potential opportunities. In this article, we [will](../w/will.md) delve into various swing [trade](../t/trade.md) setups, including classic [chart patterns](../c/chart_patterns.md), [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md), and a few advanced techniques.

### Classic Chart Patterns

Swing traders often rely on classic [chart patterns](../c/chart_patterns.md) to identify potential trading opportunities. These patterns are based on historical price movements and can signal potential reversals or continuations in price trends.

#### 1. Head and Shoulders

The [Head and Shoulders pattern](../h/head_and_shoulders_pattern.md) is a [reversal](../r/reversal.md) pattern that signals the end of an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md).

- **Components:**
  - Left Shoulder: A peak followed by a decline.
  - Head: A higher peak followed by a decline.
  - Right Shoulder: A peak lower than the head followed by a decline.
  - [Neckline](../n/neckline.md): A support level connecting the lows of the left shoulder and the head.

- **[Trade](../t/trade.md) Setup:**
  - Entry: A break below the [neckline](../n/neckline.md).
  - Stop-Loss: Above the right shoulder.
  - Take-[Profit](../p/profit.md): Measured move equal to the distance from the head to the [neckline](../n/neckline.md).

#### 2. Cup and Handle

The [Cup and Handle pattern](../c/cup_and_handle_pattern.md) is typically considered a bullish continuation pattern.

- **Components:**
  - Cup: A rounded bottom forming after a price decline.
  - [Handle](../h/handle.md): A short [consolidation](../c/consolidation.md) period (flag or [pennant](../p/pennant.md)) after the cup formation.

- **[Trade](../t/trade.md) Setup:**
  - Entry: A break above the [handle](../h/handle.md)'s resistance.
  - Stop-Loss: Below the [handle](../h/handle.md)'s low.
  - Take-[Profit](../p/profit.md): Measured move equal to the depth of the cup.

#### 3. Double Tops and Bottoms

Double Tops and Bottoms are [reversal patterns](../r/reversal_patterns.md) that can signal the end of a [trend](../t/trend.md).

- **[Double Top](../d/double_top.md):**
  - Components: Two peaks at roughly the same level with a [trough](../t/trough.md) in between.
  - [Trade](../t/trade.md) Setup:
    - Entry: A break below the [trough](../t/trough.md) level.
    - Stop-Loss: Above the peaks.
    - Take-[Profit](../p/profit.md): Measured move equal to the distance between the peaks and the [trough](../t/trough.md).

- **[Double Bottom](../d/double_bottom.md):**
  - Components: Two troughs at roughly the same level with a peak in between.
  - [Trade](../t/trade.md) Setup:
    - Entry: A break above the peak level.
    - Stop-Loss: Below the troughs.
    - Take-[Profit](../p/profit.md): Measured move equal to the distance between the troughs and the peak.

### Technical Indicators

[Technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) are mathematical calculations based on the price, [volume](../v/volume.md), or [open interest](../o/open_interest.md) of a [security](../s/security.md). Swing traders use these indicators to gauge [market](../m/market.md) conditions and predict future price movements.

#### 1. Moving Averages

Moving averages smooth out price data to help traders identify trends.

- **Simple Moving Average (SMA):** The average price over a specified period.
- **Exponential Moving Average (EMA):** Similar to SMA, but gives more weight to recent prices.

- **[Trade](../t/trade.md) Setup:**
  - Entry: When a shorter-period moving average crosses above a longer-period moving average (bullish cross).
  - Exit: When a shorter-period moving average crosses below a longer-period moving average (bearish cross).

#### 2. Relative Strength Index (RSI)

RSI is a [momentum](../m/momentum.md) [oscillator](../o/oscillator.md) that measures the speed and change of price movements.

- **Components:**
  - RSI values [range](../r/range.md) from 0 to 100.
  - [Overbought](../o/overbought.md): RSI above 70.
  - [Oversold](../o/oversold.md): RSI below 30.

- **[Trade](../t/trade.md) Setup:**
  - Entry: When RSI moves out of the [overbought](../o/overbought.md) or [oversold](../o/oversold.md) regions.
  - Confirmation: Look for additional confirmation from [price action](../p/price_action.md) or other indicators.

#### 3. Bollinger Bands

[Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md) consist of a middle band (SMA) and two outer bands (standard deviations above and below the SMA).

- **Components:**
  - Middle Band: Typically a 20-day SMA.
  - Upper and Lower Bands: Standard deviations from the middle band.

- **[Trade](../t/trade.md) Setup:**
  - Entry: When the price touches the lower band (buy) or the upper band (sell).
  - Exit: When the price moves back towards the middle band.
  - Confirmation: Look for confirmation from other indicators or [price patterns](../p/price_patterns.md).

### Advanced Techniques

Advanced [swing trading](../s/swing_trading.md) techniques can provide traders with additional tools and strategies for identifying and capitalizing on trading opportunities.

#### 1. Fibonacci Retracement

[Fibonacci retracement](../f/fibonacci_retracement.md) levels are based on the Fibonacci sequence and are used to identify potential [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels.

- **Levels:**
  - Common [retracement](../r/retracement.md) levels are 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 78.6%.

- **[Trade](../t/trade.md) Setup:**
  - Entry: When the price retraces to one of the Fibonacci levels and shows a [reversal](../r/reversal.md) signal.
  - Stop-Loss: Below the next Fibonacci level.
  - Take-[Profit](../p/profit.md): Based on previous price levels or Fibonacci extension levels.

#### 2. Ichimoku Cloud

The [Ichimoku Cloud](../i/ichimoku_cloud.md) is a comprehensive [indicator](../i/indicator.md) that provides support/resistance levels, [trend](../t/trend.md) direction, and [momentum](../m/momentum.md).

- **Components:**
  - Kijun-sen (Base Line): 26-period average.
  - Tenkan-sen (Conversion Line): 9-period average.
  - Senkou Span A and B (Leading Spans): Form the cloud.
  - Chikou Span (Lagging Span): Closing price 26 periods behind.

- **[Trade](../t/trade.md) Setup:**
  - Entry: When price and indicators align with the [trend](../t/trend.md) (price above the cloud for bullish, below for bearish).
  - Exit: When the opposite signal occurs, e.g., price moves below the cloud.
  - Confirmation: Use additional confirmation from other indicators or [price patterns](../p/price_patterns.md).

#### 3. Elliott Wave Theory

[Elliott Wave Theory](../e/elliott_wave_theory.md) posits that [market](../m/market.md) prices unfold in specific patterns called waves.

- **Components:**
  - Impulse Waves: Move in the direction of the [trend](../t/trend.md) (five waves).
  - Corrective Waves: Move against the [trend](../t/trend.md) (three waves).

- **[Trade](../t/trade.md) Setup:**
  - Entry: After identifying the completion of corrective waves.
  - Exit: After the impulse wave completes.
  - Confirmation: Additional analysis and indicators.

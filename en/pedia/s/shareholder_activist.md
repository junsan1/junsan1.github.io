# Shareholder Activist

A **[shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) activist** is an individual or a group that uses their [equity](../e/equity.md) stake in a [corporation](../c/corporation.md) to put pressure on its management. The primary aim is to achieve changes that they believe [will](../w/will.md) enhance [shareholder value](../s/shareholder_value.md), often through changes in the company's governance, strategy, [financial structure](../f/financial_structure.md), or operations. [Shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) activists challenge the status quo and use their influence to push for transformations that can [range](../r/range.md) from minor adjustments to major overhauls.

## Historical Background
[Shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) activism has its roots in the concept of [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md), which deals with how a [corporation](../c/corporation.md) is controlled and directed. The modern era of [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) activism began in earnest in the late 1970s and early 1980s, with notable figures like T. Boone Pickens and Carl Icahn coming to the forefront. These early activists were often labeled corporate raiders due to their aggressive tactics, which included hostile takeovers and leveraged buyouts. However, the movement has since evolved, and many activists today prefer to work collaboratively with companies rather than confrontationally.

## Types of Shareholder Activism
### Proxy Fights
[Proxy](../p/proxy.md) fights involve activists attempting to persuade other shareholders to use their [proxy](../p/proxy.md) votes to install new directors or support resolutions proposed by the activists. This is a common approach for activists looking to [gain](../g/gain.md) control of a company’s board.

### Shareholder Proposals
Activists may submit proposals for consideration at the company's annual meeting. These proposals can cover a wide [range](../r/range.md) of issues, from environmental and social responsibilities to executive compensation and strategic shifts.

### Public Campaigns
Activists often conduct public campaigns to raise awareness and [gain](../g/gain.md) support from other shareholders. These campaigns can involve press releases, [social media](../s/social_media.md), and other forms of communication to build a coalition in favor of their proposals.

### Litigation
In some cases, activists resort to legal action to force changes within a company. This approach can be costly and time-consuming but can lead to significant shifts in [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) or operational strategies.

## Motivations Behind Shareholder Activism
Activists are driven by a variety of motivations, which can broadly be categorized into financial and non-financial.

### Financial Motivations
- **Unlocking [Shareholder Value](../s/shareholder_value.md)**: Many activists believe that the [market](../m/market.md) has [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) a company and that specific changes can unlock this [value](../v/value.md).
- **Operational Inefficiencies**: Activists often target companies they believe are poorly managed or underperforming, suggesting strategies to improve operations and profitability.
- **[Capital Allocation](../c/capital_allocation.md)**: Changes in how a company allocates its [capital](../c/capital.md), such as returning cash to shareholders through dividends or buybacks, can be a focal point for activists.

### Non-Financial Motivations
- **Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Factors**: Increasingly, activists are motivated by ESG concerns, pushing companies to adopt more sustainable practices, improve labor conditions, or enhance board diversity.
- **Corporate Ethics**: Some activism is driven by a desire to address unethical practices within a company, such as corruption, [fraud](../f/fraud.md), or workplace harassment.

## Prominent Shareholder Activists
### Carl Icahn
One of the most well-known [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) activists, Carl Icahn has been involved in numerous high-profile campaigns, including those targeting Apple, Dell, and eBay. His approach often involves taking substantial [equity](../e/equity.md) stakes and engaging in aggressive public campaigns.

### Bill Ackman
Bill Ackman, through his [hedge fund](../h/hedge_fund.md) Pershing Square [Capital](../c/capital.md) Management, has gained a reputation for his activist campaigns against companies such as Target, Herbalife, and Valeant Pharmaceuticals. Ackman’s style often includes detailed presentations and public relations strategies to make his case.

### Elliott Management
Founded by Paul Singer, Elliott Management is another significant player in the realm of [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) activism. The [firm](../f/firm.md) is known for its campaigns involving large corporations like AT&T, Twitter, and SoftBank. Elliott Management typically employs a comprehensive approach, combining [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md) with strategic suggestions.

## Techniques and Strategies
### Extensive Research
A hallmark of successful [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) activism is thorough research. Activists spend considerable time analyzing a company’s financials, operations, [market](../m/market.md) positioning, and governance structures before launching a campaign.

### Engaging with Management
Many modern activists prefer to engage directly with a company’s management and board before taking public action. This approach can lead to constructive dialogues and mutually beneficial outcomes.

### Building Alliances
Activists often seek to build alliances with other shareholders to strengthen their influence. These alliances can [range](../r/range.md) from informal coalitions to formal partnerships with institutional investors.

### Media Campaigns
Effective use of media can amplify an activist’s message. Public campaigns through traditional media outlets and [social media](../s/social_media.md) platforms can put additional pressure on a company’s management to accept proposed changes.

### Financial Engineering
Activists might push for financial [restructuring](../r/restructuring.md), including [debt](../d/debt.md) issuance, [asset](../a/asset.md) sales, or spin-offs, to unlock [shareholder value](../s/shareholder_value.md). This approach can be controversial but is often effective in realizing the financial potential of a company’s assets.

## Impact on Companies
### Positive Outcomes
- **Improved Performance**: Many companies targeted by activists see improvements in their operational and [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) resulting from the proposed changes.
- **Enhanced Governance**: [Shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) activism often leads to better governance practices, including increased board independence, [transparency](../t/transparency.md), and accountability.
- **[Market](../m/market.md) Confidence**: Successful activism can boost [investor](../i/investor.md) confidence, leading to stock price appreciation and a more favorable [market](../m/market.md) perception.

### Negative Outcomes
- **Short-Term Focus**: Critics argue that activists may prioritize short-term financial gains over long-term sustainability, potentially harming the company’s future prospects.
- **Distraction and Costs**: Activist campaigns can be disruptive and costly, diverting management’s attention from running the [business](../b/business.md) and incurring legal and consulting fees.
- **Adversarial Relationships**: Public and aggressive activism can lead to adversarial relationships between activists and management, complicating governance and operational decisions.

## Regulatory and Legal Considerations
### SEC Regulations
In the United States, [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) activism is subject to regulations by the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC). Rules governing [proxy](../p/proxy.md) fights, [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) requirements, and [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) proposals are key regulatory areas.

### Corporate Bylaws
Companies often have bylaws that define the process for [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) proposals and voting. Activists must navigate these bylaws, which can vary significantly between companies.

### International Perspectives
[Shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) activism is not limited to the United States. Different countries have varying legal and regulatory frameworks that can impact the effectiveness and strategies of activism. For example, activism in Europe and Asia often involves navigating more complex regulatory environments and cultural differences.

## Future Trends in Shareholder Activism
### Rise of ESG Activism
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors are becoming increasingly important in [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) activism. Activists are progressively focusing on issues such as climate change, [social justice](../s/social_justice.md), and [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) reforms.

### Technological Influence
The advancement of technology is changing how activism is conducted. [Social media](../s/social_media.md), [data analytics](../d/data_analytics.md), and digital communication tools allow activists to mobilize support more efficiently and reach a broader audience.

### Institutional Investor Involvement
Institutional investors, such as pension funds and mutual funds, are playing a more active role in [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) activism. These investors have significant influence due to their substantial [holdings](../h/holdings.md) and can be pivotal allies or opponents in activist campaigns.

### Collaborative Approaches
The [trend](../t/trend.md) towards more collaborative approaches between activists and company management is likely to continue. Constructive engagement can lead to better outcomes for all stakeholders involved, reducing the adversarial nature of traditional activism.

## Notable Case Studies
### Apple Inc.
Carl Icahn’s campaign targeting Apple Inc. in 2013-2016 aimed at pushing the company to [return](../r/return.md) more [capital](../c/capital.md) to shareholders through [share buybacks](../s/share_buybacks.md) and dividends. While the campaign was contentious, it eventually led to Apple increasing its [buyback](../b/buyback.md) program significantly.

### Unilever
Elliott Management’s engagement with Unilever in 2021 focused on urging the company to review its [business](../b/business.md) structure and consider a break-up to unlock [shareholder value](../s/shareholder_value.md). The campaign highlighted the growing [trend](../t/trend.md) of activists targeting multinational conglomerates.

### P&G
Procter & Gamble faced a major activist campaign in 2017 from [Nelson Peltz](../n/nelson_peltz.md)’s Trian Partners. The campaign culminated in a highly publicized [proxy fight](../p/proxy_fight.md), with Peltz eventually winning a board seat. The campaign focused on improving P&G’s innovation, cost structure, and organizational [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md).

## Conclusion
[Shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) activism is a dynamic and influential force in the corporate world, capable of driving significant changes within companies. While it can bring about positive transformation and enhance [shareholder value](../s/shareholder_value.md), it also carries risks and challenges. Understanding the motivations, strategies, and impacts of [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) activism is crucial for investors, company management, and policy-makers navigating this complex landscape.

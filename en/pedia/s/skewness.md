# Skewness

In probability theory and statistics, skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable about its mean. Skewness can be calculated as the third standardized moment of the distribution. It indicates the extent and direction of deviation from a symmetrical distribution.

## Types of Skewness:

1. **Positive Skew (Right Skew)**: In a positively skewed distribution, the tail on the right side is longer or fatter than the left side. The mean and median will be greater than the mode. Examples include income distributions where a small number of people earn disproportionately higher incomes.

2. **Negative Skew (Left Skew)**: In a negatively skewed distribution, the tail on the left side is longer or fatter than the right side. The mean and median will be less than the mode. This is commonly observed in test scores where a large proportion of participants score highly.

## Mathematical Definition:

Skewness is typically denoted by the Greek letter \( \gamma_1 \) and is defined as:

\[ \gamma_1 = \frac{\mu_3}{\sigma^3} = \frac{E[(X - \mu)^3]}{\sigma^3} \]

where:
- \( \mu_3 \) is the third central moment,
- \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation,
- \( \mu \) is the mean of the distribution,
- \( E \) denotes the expectation operator.

## Interpretation:

- **Skewness = 0**: The distribution is perfectly symmetrical.
- **Skewness > 0**: Indicates a distribution that is skewed to the right.
- **Skewness < 0**: Indicates a distribution that is skewed to the left.

## Practical Applications:

Skewness is particularly useful in finance and trading for understanding the distribution of asset returns, risk analysis, and portfolio management. Traditional financial theories often assume a normal distribution of returns, but in reality, financial returns can exhibit significant skewness. Understanding skewness helps in better risk management and strategy development.

### Financial Markets:

In financial markets, skewness impacts options pricing, portfolio management, and risk assessments. For example:

- **Options Pricing**: Skewness affects the pricing of options as the Black-Scholes model assumes lognormal distribution of asset prices. Negative skew suggests higher demand for puts relative to calls, implying higher premiums for tail risk protection.
  
- **Portfolio Management**: Portfolio managers aim to construct portfolios with desirable skew properties. Positive skewness is often preferred as it implies the potential for higher returns.

- **Risk Management**: Skewness informs Value at Risk (VaR) models, helping in understanding the likelihood of extreme losses or gains.

## Skewness in Algorithmic Trading:

In algorithmic trading, skewness can be used for:

- **Signal Generation**: Algorithms can be designed to capture skewness in price movements, anticipating sharp moves in a specific direction.
  
- **Strategy Evaluation**: Evaluating the skewness of strategy returns to ensure the robustness and suitability under different market conditions.
  
- **Risk Adjustments**: Adjusting position sizes based on skewness to manage tail risks effectively.

### Case Study:

Consider a trading algorithm designed to trade large-cap stocks. Upon analyzing historical price data, the algorithm identifies periods where stock returns show significant positive skewness. During these periods, the algorithm increases position sizes in the direction of the skew to capitalize on the expected continued upward movement. Conversely, if negative skewness is detected, position sizes are reduced or protective puts are purchased to hedge against significant downward moves.

## Limitations of Skewness:

1. **Sample Size Sensitivity**: Skewness can be very sensitive to sample size and may provide misleading information if the sample is not representative.

2. **Outliers Impact**: Skewness is heavily influenced by outliers, which can distort the true distribution characteristics.

3. **Combining Assets**: When combining several assets into a portfolio, the skewness of individual asset returns might not represent the skewness of the portfolio returns. Proper consideration and calculation are required.

## Tools and Software:

Skewness can be calculated using various statistical tools and software, such as:

- **Microsoft Excel**: Using the `SKEW` function.
- **R**: Using functions from the `moments` package.
- **Python**: Utilizing libraries such as Pandas (method `.skew()`) and SciPy.

## Example Calculation:

### Python:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Sample data
returns = [0.10, 0.20, 0.15, -0.10, 0.05, -0.30, 0.25, -0.05]
returns_series = pd.Series(returns)

# Calculate skewness
skewness = returns_series.skew()
print(f'Skewness: {skewness}')
```

This code calculates the skewness of a list of returns using the Pandas library in Python. 

### R:

```R
# Sample data
returns <- c(0.10, 0.20, 0.15, -0.10, 0.05, -0.30, 0.25, -0.05)

# Calculate skewness
library(moments)
skewness <- skewness(returns)
print(paste("Skewness: ", skewness))
```

This R script calculates the skewness using the `moments` package.

# Sum-of-the-Parts Valuation (SOTP)

The Sum-of-the-Parts (SOTP) [valuation](../v/valuation.md) method, also known as breakup [valuation](../v/valuation.md) or SOTP analysis, is a technique used in [financial modeling](../f/financial_modeling.md) to [value](../v/value.md) a company by assessing the [value](../v/value.md) of its individual [business](../b/business.md) units separately and then summing them up. This method is particularly useful in the case of conglomerates, holding companies, or businesses with diverse subsidiaries and segments. Unlike traditional [valuation](../v/valuation.md) methods that focus on the company as a single entity, SOTP highlights the individual worth of each of the company's components, providing detailed insights into how different segments contribute to the overall [valuation](../v/valuation.md).

## Breakdown of the SOTP Approach

The process involves several key steps:

### 1. Identification of Business Segments

The initial step in the SOTP [valuation](../v/valuation.md) approach requires the identification and segregation of the company's distinct [business](../b/business.md) units or segments. For conglomerates, this could mean separating the media arm from the [logistics](../l/logistics.md) arm, for instance. Segregation is typically based on operational lines, geographical markets, or product lines.

### 2. Valuation of Individual Segments

Each [business](../b/business.md) unit is then valued independently using appropriate [valuation](../v/valuation.md) methods. This could involve:

- **Discounted [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md) (DCF)**: This involves [forecasting](../f/forecasting.md) the future cash flows for the [business](../b/business.md) segment and [discounting](../d/discounting.md) them back to their [present value](../p/present_value.md) using an appropriate [discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md).
- **[Market](../m/market.md) Multiples**: Comparing the segment with similar publicly traded companies and applying relevant multiples such as Price/[Earnings](../e/earnings.md) (P/E), Enterprise [Value](../v/value.md)/EBITDA, etc.
- **[Transaction](../t/transaction.md) Comparables**: Looking at recent transactions involving similar companies or segments to gauge [market value](../m/market_value.md).

### 3. Adjustment for Debt and Cash

Once the individual segments have been valued, adjustments are made for the company's [debt](../d/debt.md) and cash [holdings](../h/holdings.md). If the [business](../b/business.md) units are operating with their own allocated [debt](../d/debt.md), this needs to be subtracted from the segment's [value](../v/value.md).

### 4. Summing Up

The values of all the [business](../b/business.md) segments are then aggregated to derive the total enterprise [value](../v/value.md). Any adjustments for [net debt](../n/net_debt.md), minority interests, or other financial [obligations](../o/obligation.md) are also incorporated at this stage.

### 5. Review and Sensitivity Analysis

A final review is conducted, often involving [sensitivity analysis](../s/sensitivity_analysis.md) to understand how changes in key assumptions affect the overall [valuation](../v/valuation.md).

## Reasons for Using SOTP

### Focus on Underlying Value

SOTP highlights the often-hidden [value](../v/value.md) within diverse conglomerates, where certain strong-performing units might be overshadowed by underperforming ones.

### Clarification for Investors

It provides clarity for investors who can better understand how different segments contribute to the overall [value](../v/value.md) and performance of the company. This is often useful during periods of corporate [restructuring](../r/restructuring.md).

### Aids in Strategic Decisions

Managers can use SOTP analysis to decide whether to spin off, sell, or restructure divisions to unlock [value](../v/value.md).

### Benchmarking Performance

This method allows for benchmarking each [business](../b/business.md) unit against [industry](../i/industry.md) standards, facilitating better performance measurement and management.

## Challenges and Limitations

While SOTP offers granular insights, it also has several limitations:

### Complexity and Data Availability

Valuing each segment independently requires detailed financial data which might not always be available or easily accessible.

### Subjectivity in Valuation

The choice of [valuation](../v/valuation.md) method and the assumptions made ([discount](../d/discount.md) rates, growth projections, etc.) introduce a degree of subjectivity.

### Synergies and Interdependencies

[Business](../b/business.md) segments often share synergies and interdependencies that are hard to quantify in isolation. Ignoring these could lead to over- or under-[valuation](../v/valuation.md).

### Timing and Market Conditions

SOTP valuations can be highly sensitive to [market](../m/market.md) conditions and the specific timing of the [valuation](../v/valuation.md) process, leading to potential [volatility](../v/volatility.md) in the estimated [value](../v/value.md).

## Practical Example of SOTP

A real-world example can provide a more nuanced understanding of SOTP. Consider "General Electric (GE)" [General Electric](https://www.ge.com/), a global [conglomerate](../c/conglomerate.md) operating in [multiple](../m/multiple.md) segments including aviation, healthcare, power, and renewable energy.

### Step-by-Step Valuation:

#### Identification of Segments

GE is segmented into Aviation, Healthcare, Power, Renewable Energy, and [Capital](../c/capital.md).

#### Valuation of Each Segment

- **Aviation**: Valued using DCF analysis, given its predictable cash flows and substantial [market share](../m/market_share.md).
- **Healthcare**: [Market](../m/market.md) multiples are used, comparing to other public healthcare companies.
- **Power and Renewable Energy**: These segments benefit from [transaction](../t/transaction.md) comparables, considering recent M&As in the [industry](../i/industry.md).
- **[Capital](../c/capital.md)**: Valued based on the [book value](../b/book_value.md) of financial assets and adjustments for [risk](../r/risk.md) exposure.

### Aggregation and Adjustments

Each segment’s [value](../v/value.md) is aggregated. Adjustments are made for GE's overall [debt](../d/debt.md) and cash positions, to derive the company’s net enterprise [value](../v/value.md).

### Result

The consolidated [value](../v/value.md) reflects the sum of the valuations of its individual segments minus any net liabilities.

## Conclusion

The Sum-of-the-Parts (SOTP) [valuation](../v/valuation.md) method is a comprehensive tool for understanding the individual components of a diversified [business](../b/business.md). It provides detailed insights into how various segments contribute to the overall company [value](../v/value.md), helping investors, managers, and stakeholders make more informed decisions. Despite its complexity and the subjectivity involved, the granularity it offers makes it an invaluable approach in the [valuation](../v/valuation.md) toolkit.

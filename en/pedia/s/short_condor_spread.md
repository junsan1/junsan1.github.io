# Short Condor Spread

The Short Condor Spread is a sophisticated [options](../o/options.md) [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) designed for traders who anticipate minimal price movement in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) over the life of the [options](../o/options.md). It's an advanced strategy, combining elements of both bullish and bearish strategies to create a position that profits from low [volatility](../v/volatility.md), often referred to as a "[neutral](../n/neutral.md)" strategy.

## Overview

The Short Condor Spread is constructed by selling one lower strike call, buying one lower-middle strike call, buying one upper-middle strike call, and selling one upper strike call. It can alternatively be constructed with [put options](../p/put_options.md), involving selling one lower strike put, buying one lower-middle strike put, buying one upper-middle strike put, and selling one upper strike put. Despite the involvement of [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [options](../o/options.md), it results in a net [credit](../c/credit.md) to the [trader](../t/trader.md) upon initiation.

### Components of a Short Condor Spread

1. **Sell a Lower Strike Call/Put**: Generates [income](../i/income.md) from the [premium](../p/premium.md) received.
2. **Buy a Lower-Middle Strike Call/Put**: Limits [risk](../r/risk.md) below the lower-middle [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).
3. **Buy an Upper-Middle Strike Call/Put**: Limits [risk](../r/risk.md) above the upper-middle [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).
4. **Sell an Upper Strike Call/Put**: Generates additional [income](../i/income.md) from the [premium](../p/premium.md) received.

## Objectives of the Strategy

The main objective of the Short Condor Spread is to take advantage of low [volatility](../v/volatility.md) in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). By setting up this strategy, the [trader](../t/trader.md) expects the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) to remain within a specific [range](../r/range.md). The strategy achieves its maximum [profit](../p/profit.md) if the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price remains between the middle strikes at expiration. 

## Risk Profile

The [risk](../r/risk.md) profile of the Short Condor Spread is defined by the net [credit](../c/credit.md) received from the [sale](../s/sale.md) of the [spreads](../s/spreads.md) and the maximum loss, which occurs if the [asset](../a/asset.md) price moves beyond the strike prices of the short [options](../o/options.md).

- **Maximum [Profit](../p/profit.md)**: Limited to the net [credit](../c/credit.md) received.
- **Maximum Loss**: Limited to the difference between adjacent strike prices minus the net [credit](../c/credit.md) received.

## Profit and Loss Calculation

To evaluate the profitability of a Short Condor Spread, it is crucial to understand the following scenarios:

1. **If the price stays within the middle strike prices**: Both the outer short [options](../o/options.md) expire worthless, and the premiums from the short [options](../o/options.md) result in the net [credit](../c/credit.md), leading to the maximum [profit](../p/profit.md) realization.
2. **If the price moves beyond the middle strike prices but stays within the inner long [options](../o/options.md)**: Partial loss is incurred, but overall, the [trade](../t/trade.md) remains profitable.
3. **If the price moves outside all the [options](../o/options.md)' strike prices**: Both long [options](../o/options.md) [exercise](../e/exercise.md), leading to the maximum possible loss.

### Break-even Points

To determine the break-even points, two price levels must be calculated:
1. Lower Break-even Point: Lower strike call/put price + Net [Credit](../c/credit.md) received.
2. Upper Break-even Point: Upper strike call/put price - Net [Credit](../c/credit.md) received.

## Example of Short Condor Spread

Consider an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) trading at $50:

1. Sell 1 Call with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $45 for $0.50.
2. Buy 1 Call with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $50 for $1.00.
3. Buy 1 Call with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $55 for $1.00.
4. Sell 1 Call with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $60 for $0.50.

Net [credit](../c/credit.md) received = (0.50 + 0.50) - (1.00 + 1.00) = -1.00

[Profit](../p/profit.md) scenarios:
- If the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) stays between $50 and $55, both outer short calls expire worthless, the maximum [profit](../p/profit.md) of $1.00 is realized.

## Position Management

Proper management of the Short Condor Spread involves continuous monitoring of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price movement and [volatility](../v/volatility.md). Adjustments may be needed if significant price movements are anticipated or if the [volatility](../v/volatility.md) increases unexpectedly.

### Adjustments

- **Rolling the Spread**: Moving the entire positions to different strike prices with similar time to expiration or to a later [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md).
- **Exiting the Position Early**: If the anticipated low [volatility](../v/volatility.md) scenario is no longer valid, closing out the position to avoid potential losses.

## Ideal Market Conditions

The Short Condor Spread thrives in low [volatility](../v/volatility.md) conditions with the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) exhibiting minimal price movement. [Market](../m/market.md) conditions might be ideal if [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md) show stable growth forecasts without significant swings.

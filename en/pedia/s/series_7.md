# Series 7

The Series 7, officially known as the General Securities Representative Exam (GSRE), is a license required for individuals who wish to engage in the trading of various forms of securities in the United States. This examination and the resulting license are regulated by the Financial [Industry](../i/industry.md) Regulatory Authority (FINRA). The Series 7 license permits financial professionals to sell a broad [range](../r/range.md) of securities, including corporate [stocks](../s/stock.md) and bonds, [municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md), [options](../o/options.md), direct participation programs, and variable contracts related to the securities [market](../m/market.md).

## Background

The [Securities Exchange Act of 1934](../s/securities_exchange_act_of_1934.md) established the foundation for regulatory practices in the [financial sector](../f/financial_sector.md). This act created the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) to enforce federal securities laws, regulate the securities [industry](../i/industry.md), and ensure fair practices. FINRA, an independent regulator, was formed to oversee brokerage firms and their registered representatives. FINRA's responsibilities include licensing, regulation compliance, dispute resolution, and rule enforcement.

The Series 7 license is a foundational qualification for brokerage representatives. It ensures that professionals possess the essential knowledge and skills required to perform their roles ethically and competently. The exam covers various aspects of the securities [industry](../i/industry.md), including regulations, practices, and specific types of securities.

## Exam Structure

The Series 7 exam is comprehensive, consisting of 125 [multiple](../m/multiple.md)-choice questions. Candidates are given 225 minutes to complete the exam. The questions are designed to assess the test-taker’s knowledge in four primary job functions, as defined by FINRA:

1. **Seeks [Business](../b/business.md) for the [Broker-Dealer](../b/broker-dealer.md) from Customers and Potential Customers**: This section covers [marketing](../m/marketing.md) strategies, client [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md), and the building of client relationships.
   
2. **Evaluates Customers’ Financial Profile and Investment Objectives**: This portion assesses the candidate’s ability to evaluate and record a [customer](../c/customer.md)’s financial situation, investment objectives, and [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md).

3. **Provides Customers with Information About Investments, Makes Suitable Recommendations, Transfers Assets, and Maintains Appropriate Records**: This section focuses on providing information about investments, making recommendations that align with customers’ needs, transferring assets, and maintaining records.

The passing score for the Series 7 exam is 72%. Successful candidates are granted the Series 7 license, which is a prerequisite for trading many types of securities.

## Preparation and Study Resources

Preparation for the Series 7 exam involves understanding a significant amount of material related to securities regulations, product specifications, and ethical guidelines. Candidates often spend several months studying before attempting the exam. Study resources include:

- **FINRA Study Guide**: FINRA provides an official study guide that details the exam content and structure.

- **Self-Study Materials**: Various publishers [offer](../o/offer.md) self-study books and online resources, including detailed textbooks, flashcards, and mobile applications.

## Professional Significance

Obtaining the Series 7 license is a pivotal step in the career of a financial professional. It opens up opportunities for various roles within the securities [industry](../i/industry.md), such as:

- **[Stockbroker](../s/stockbroker.md)**: Advises clients on investment opportunities and executes buy and sell orders.
  
- **[Financial Advisor](../f/financial_advisor.md)**: Provides financial advice and [portfolio management](../p/par.md) services to individual and institutional clients.
  
- **Investment Banker**: Assists corporations in raising [capital](../c/capital.md) through securities offerings and advises on mergers and acquisitions.

- **[Compliance Officer](../c/compliance_officer.md)**: Ensures that the [firm](../f/firm.md) complies with all regulations and standards, protecting both the [firm](../f/firm.md) and its clients from legal liabilities.

## Series 7 vs. Other Securities Licenses

The Series 7 license is often compared with other securities licenses, particularly the [Series 6](../s/series_6.md) and [Series 63](../s/series_63.md):

- **[Series 6](../s/series_6.md)**: Limited to the [sale](../s/sale.md) of mutual funds, [insurance](../i/insurance.md) products, and variable annuities. It does not cover the broader [scope](../s/scope.md) of securities permitted under the Series 7 license.
  
- **[Series 63](../s/series_63.md)**: Focuses on state-specific laws and regulations. Often, professionals [hold](../h/hold.md) both the Series 7 and [Series 63](../s/series_63.md) licenses to legally [trade](../t/trade.md) securities across different states.

## Continuing Education and License Maintenance

Maintaining the Series 7 license requires adherence to continuing education requirements. FINRA mandates that registered representatives complete continuing education programs to stay updated on regulatory changes, [ethical standards](../e/ethical_standards_in_trading.md), and advancements in the securities [industry](../i/industry.md). The continuing education program consists of two main components:

1. **Regulatory Element**: Conducted by FINRA, this component must be completed within 120 days of a representative’s second anniversary and every three years thereafter. It focuses on regulatory, compliance, ethical, and sales practice standards.

2. **[Firm](../f/firm.md) Element**: Developed and administered by the employing [firm](../f/firm.md), this component requires registered representatives to complete annual training programs tailored to the specific needs of the [firm](../f/firm.md)’s [business](../b/business.md) and associated risks.

## Conclusion

The Series 7 license is a cornerstone of a career in the securities [industry](../i/industry.md). It equips financial professionals with the requisite knowledge and legal authorization to engage in the broad [sale](../s/sale.md) of securities. Aspiring candidates must meet the stringent educational, ethical, and regulatory standards set forth by FINRA to obtain and maintain this credential.

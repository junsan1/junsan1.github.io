# Slippage

Slippage refers to the difference between the expected price of a [trade](../t/trade.md) and the actual price at which the [trade](../t/trade.md) is executed. It is a phenomenon that occurs in all [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), including [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, forex, and commodities. Slippage can be both positive and negative; however, it is most commonly encountered as an undesirable occurrence that exacerbates [trading costs](../t/trading_costs.md) and impacts profitability.

## Types of Slippage

### 1. **Positive Slippage**
Positive slippage occurs when a [trade](../t/trade.md) is executed at a better price than expected. This typically happens during periods of low [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and high [market](../m/market.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md). For example, if an [investor](../i/investor.md) places a buy [order](../o/order.md) at $100 but it gets filled at $99.50, positive slippage has occurred.

### 2. **Negative Slippage**
Negative slippage occurs when a [trade](../t/trade.md) is executed at a worse price than expected. This is more common, especially during periods of high [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and low [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md). For instance, if a [trader](../t/trader.md) places a sell [order](../o/order.md) at $100 but it gets executed at $99.50, negative slippage has occurred.

### 3. **Zero Slippage**
Zero slippage is when a [trade](../t/trade.md) is executed exactly at the expected price. This is ideal but often rare, particularly in fast-moving markets or when trading large volumes.

## Causes of Slippage

### 1. **Market Volatility**
During times of high [volatility](../v/volatility.md), prices can change rapidly in a short period. The time it takes for a trading [order](../o/order.md) to be executed can result in a different price compared to what was initially expected.

### 2. **Low Liquidity**
In markets or specific assets with low [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), there may not be enough orders on the [order book](../o/order_book.md) to match the [trade](../t/trade.md) at the expected price. This can cause the price to shift, resulting in slippage.

### 3. **Order Type**
Different [order types](../o/order_types_in_trading.md) can also impact slippage. [Market](../m/market.md) orders, which are executed immediately at the current [market](../m/market.md) prices, are more susceptible to slippage compared to limit orders, which set a maximum or minimum price at which you are willing to buy or sell.

### 4. **Trade Size**
Larger [trade](../t/trade.md) sizes can experience more slippage than smaller trades. Moving large quantities can necessitate [multiple](../m/multiple.md) transactions at varying prices to fulfill a single [order](../o/order.md).

## Measuring Slippage

### 1. **Basis Points**
Slippage is often measured in [basis](../b/basis.md) points to provide a standardized view. One [basis](../b/basis.md) point equals 0.01%. If the expected [trade](../t/trade.md) price is $100 and the actual [trade](../t/trade.md) price is $99.50, the negative slippage would be 50 [basis](../b/basis.md) points.

### 2. **Absolute Value**
The absolute [value](../v/value.md) method involves calculating the difference in monetary terms. If the expected [trade](../t/trade.md) price is $100 and the actual price is $99.50, the slippage is $0.50 per unit traded.

### 3. **Relative Value**
[Relative value](../r/relative_value.md) slippage is expressed as a percentage of the expected price. In the aforementioned example, a $0.50 deviation in a $100 expected price would result in a 0.5% slippage.

## Impact on Trading

### 1. **Cost of Trading**
Negative slippage increases the cost of trading, thus reducing profitability. The more frequently trades are executed, the higher the cumulative cost due to slippage.

### 2. **Trade Performance**
Slippage can distort the actual performance of [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), especially those that rely on high-frequency or tight [spreads](../s/spreads.md).

### 3. **Risk Management**
Excessive slippage can affect [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) strategies. [Stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md) may not be executed at the expected level, exposing the [trader](../t/trader.md) to higher-than-anticipated losses.

---

## Mitigation Techniques

### 1. **Using Limit Orders**
Limit orders can be set to execute only at a specified price or better, effectively controlling the potential for slippage.

### 2. **Trading During Low Volatility**
Executing trades during periods of lower [volatility](../v/volatility.md) can reduce the likelihood of price changes during [order](../o/order.md) [execution](../e/execution.md).

### 3. **Improving Order Execution Speed**
Ensuring rapid [execution](../e/execution.md) can minimize the time frame in which price movements can occur, thus reducing slippage.

### 4. **Trade Size Management**
Breaking large orders into smaller chunks can minimize the impact on [market price](../m/market_price.md) and reduce slippage.

## Slippage in Algorithmic Trading

In [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), slippage is a critical [factor](../f/factor.md) that algorithms must account for. Algorithms can be designed to optimize [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) that minimize slippage. Techniques include:

### 1. **Smart Order Routing (SOR)**
Advanced algorithms can route orders across [multiple](../m/multiple.md) venues to find the best possible [execution](../e/execution.md) price, thereby reducing slippage.

### 2. **Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) Algorithms**
These algorithms aim to execute orders in line with the [volume](../v/volume.md)-[weighted average](../w/weighted_average.md) price, thereby minimizing the [market](../m/market.md) impact and slippage.

### 3. **Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) Algorithms**
TWAP strategies break down large orders into smaller parts executed over a specific period to minimize slippage.

### 4. **Implementation Shortfall Algorithms**
These algorithms strive to minimize the [execution](../e/execution.md) cost, including slippage, relative to the initial decision price.

## Real-World Examples

### 1. **High-Frequency Trading Firms**
High-frequency trading (HFT) firms, such as Virtu Financial, extensively utilize algorithms to mitigate slippage and other [execution](../e/execution.md) costs. More information about their techniques can be found on [Virtu Financial's website](https://www.virtu.com/).

### 2. **Retail Brokers**
Retail brokers like [Interactive Brokers](../i/interactive_brokers.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) a [range](../r/range.md) of [order types](../o/order_types_in_trading.md) and advanced algorithms designed to [handle](../h/handle.md) slippage efficiently. More details are available on [Interactive Brokers' website](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/).

## Conclusion

Slippage is an inevitable aspect of trading that represents the difference between the expected and actual prices of [trade](../t/trade.md) [execution](../e/execution.md). It can be both positive and negative, albeit it is generally known for increasing [trading costs](../t/trading_costs.md). Understanding the causes, measuring methods, and mitigation techniques is crucial for traders and investors seeking to optimize their [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) and maximize profitability. Techniques like using limit orders, trading during low [volatility](../v/volatility.md), and leveraging advanced algorithms play a significant role in mitigating the adverse effects of slippage.

By continually optimizing [execution](../e/execution.md) methods and understanding [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md), traders can better manage slippage and improve their overall [trading performance](../t/trading_performance.md).

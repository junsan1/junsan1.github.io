# Service Charge

A service charge, in financial and commercial terminology, refers to an additional [fee](../f/fee.md) billed on a [transaction](../t/transaction.md), service, or product.

## Service Charge in Hospitality

### Definition and Purpose
In the hospitality [industry](../i/industry.md), a service charge is often added to the bill in places like restaurants, hotels, and catering services. It is intended to cover the cost of services rendered by the staff that may not be directly itemized (e.g., gratuities for waitstaff).

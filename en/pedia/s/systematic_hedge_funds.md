# Systematic Hedge Funds

Systematic hedge funds, also known as quantitative or algo funds, are managed using computer algorithms and models to make investment decisions. These funds leverage advanced mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques to analyze a vast array of data and execute trades based on pre-defined criteria. Unlike traditional hedge funds, which rely heavily on human discretion and [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md), systematic hedge funds focus on removing human emotion and bias from the investment process. This document provides an in-depth examination of systematic hedge funds, their strategies, key players, and the implications of their operations in financial markets.

## Overview of Systematic Hedge Funds

Systematic hedge funds operate by employing algorithmic, or rule-based, strategies that can vary from momentum and trend-following to [mean reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md) and statistical [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md). The primary aim is to create a set of rules or models that can predict market movements and generate profits. These strategies can be classified into short-term, medium-term, and long-term horizons, with each timeframe requiring different types of data and methods for analysis.

### Strategies Employed by Systematic Hedge Funds

Systematic hedge funds use various strategies differing in complexity and objectives. 

#### Trend Following

[Trend following](../t/trend_following.md) strategies aim to capitalize on market trends by entering positions in the direction of the trend. These strategies often use [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) such as moving averages and breakouts.

1. **[Moving Average Crossovers](../m/moving_average_crossovers.md)**: Entering a trade when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average.
2. **[Momentum Indicators](../m/momentum_indicators.md)**: Utilizing indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to identify potential entry points.
3. **Breakouts**: Buying or selling when the price breaks through a predefined level of support or resistance.

#### Mean Reversion

[Mean reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md) strategies are based on the assumption that asset prices will revert to their historical mean over time. These strategies identify securities that have deviated significantly from their average price and take opposite positions.

1. **Statistical [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**: Profiting from pricing inefficiencies between related instruments.
2. **Pair Trading**: Trading two correlated instruments by taking long positions in the undervalued security and short positions in the overvalued one.
3. **[Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md)**: Using the upper and lower bands to identify overbought or oversold conditions.

#### Arbitrage Strategies

[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategies exploit price discrepancies between related assets or markets. They often involve simultaneous buying and selling to lock in profits with minimal risk.

1. **Convertible [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**: Trading convertible securities against the underlying stock.
2. **Merger [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**: Profiting from price movements before and after merger announcements.
3. **Fixed Income [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**: Exploiting price differentials between fixed-income securities.

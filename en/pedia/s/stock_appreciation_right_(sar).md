# Stock Appreciation Right (SAR)

A Stock Appreciation Right (SAR) is a [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) used in [finance](../f/finance.md) and [investing](../i/investing.md), most commonly seen as part of executive compensation packages. SARs allow recipients to benefit from the increase in the company's stock price over a specific period without requiring them to purchase or own the stock itself. This makes SARs an attractive alternative to traditional stock [options](../o/options.md).

## How SARs Work

When an employer grants a SAR to an employee, they essentially provide the right to receive a [payment](../p/payment.md) equivalent to the increase in the price of the company’s [shares](../s/shares.md) over a predetermined period. The [baseline](../b/baseline.md) price, or [grant](../g/grant.md) price, is set at the time of issuance. If the stock's price increases above this [grant](../g/grant.md) price, the employee can then [exercise](../e/exercise.md) the SAR and receive the difference.

### Example

Suppose a company grants an employee SARs with a base price of $50. If the stock rises to $70, the employee would be entitled to a $20 per SAR [payout](../p/payout.md).

## Types of SARs

There are two main types of Stock Appreciation Rights:

1. **Standalone SARs** – These are granted independently from other stock [options](../o/options.md) or [equity](../e/equity.md) plans. They are simply rights to receive the stock price appreciation without any need to purchase or own the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock.

2. **Tandem SARs** – These are issued in conjunction with stock [options](../o/options.md). When an employee exercises their [options](../o/options.md), they can simultaneously [exercise](../e/exercise.md) the associated SARs, receiving compensation in cash or additional [shares](../s/shares.md) of stock.

## Benefits of SARs

### For Employers

1. **Non-Dilutive**: Unlike stock [options](../o/options.md) that require issuing new [shares](../s/shares.md) when exercised, SARs do not necessarily dilute the existing shareholders' ownership because SARs can be paid in cash rather than stock.
2. **Regulatory Compliance**: SARs [offer](../o/offer.md) a simpler compliance landscape compared to other compensation plans that involve actual [equity](../e/equity.md) [distribution](../d/distribution.md).
3. **Attract and Retain Talent**: [Offering](../o/offering.md) SARs can be an attractive benefit in employee compensation packages, helping to recruit and retain key talents, especially executives.

### For Employees

1. **[Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md) Flexibility**: Employees can [gain](../g/gain.md) financially without the upfront costs associated with purchasing stock.
2. **Less [Financial Risk](../f/financial_risk.md)**: Since employees don’t have to buy stock, they avoid the [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with the potential decline in stock price.
3. **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)**: If SARs are structured to be paid in cash, employees receive immediate monetary benefits.

## Tax Implications

### For Employers

The cost of settling SARs (whether in cash or stock) is generally tax-deductible, as it is considered a form of compensation [expense](../e/expense.md). However, the exact tax treatment can vary based on jurisdiction and specific [accounting](../a/accounting.md) rules.

### For Employees

The tax impact for employees can vary depending on whether SARs are settled in cash or stock. Typically, SARs are taxed as [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md) at the time of [exercise](../e/exercise.md). The [value](../v/value.md) received (either cash or the stock equivalent) is subject to [income tax](../i/income_tax.md) and [payroll](../p/payroll.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md).

## Vesting and Expiry

Like other forms of [equity compensation](../e/equity_compensation.md), SARs often come with [vesting](../v/vesting.md) schedules, ensuring that it serves as an incentive over time rather than an immediate [payout](../p/payout.md). Common [vesting](../v/vesting.md) schedules include:

- **Cliff [Vesting](../v/vesting.md)**: The entire SAR [grant](../g/grant.md) vests at a single point in time after a specified period.
- **[Graded Vesting](../g/graded_vesting.md)**: Portions of the SAR [grant](../g/grant.md) vest incrementally over time.

### Expiry

SARs [will](../w/will.md) typically have an [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md), often ten years from the [grant](../g/grant.md) date. If the SARs are not exercised within this time frame, they expire worthless.

## Accounting Considerations

From an [accounting](../a/accounting.md) perspective, SARs can be complicated to manage. The following are important:

1. **Measurement of [fair value](../f/fair_value.md)**: The [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) of SARs must be calculated, often using financial models like the [Black-Scholes model](../b/black-scholes_model.md) for [options](../o/options.md) pricing.
2. **Periodic [Revaluation](../r/revaluation.md)**: Unlike traditional stock [options](../o/options.md), SARs often require periodic [revaluation](../r/revaluation.md), especially if settled in cash. This ensures accurate reflection of liabilities on the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md).

## Comparison with Stock Options

### Similarities

1. **Performance Incentive**: Both are used to incentivize employees to improve the company’s stock performance.
2. **Ease for Employers**: Both can be structured to provide tax benefits and avoid immediate cash outflows.

### Differences

1. **Ownership**: Stock [options](../o/options.md) entail the purchase of stock, while SARs involve no actual stock ownership.
2. **[Dilution](../d/dilution.md)**: Exercising stock [options](../o/options.md) usually causes [dilution](../d/dilution.md); SARs can be non-dilutive if settled in cash.
3. **Complexity**: SARs usually involve more complex [valuation](../v/valuation.md) and [accounting](../a/accounting.md) processes compared to stock [options](../o/options.md).

## Use in Executive Compensation

SARs are notably popular in executive compensation for a variety of reasons:

1. **Alignment of Interests**: SARs align the interests of the executives with those of shareholders.
2. **Tax [Efficiency](../e/efficiency.md)**: They can be more tax-efficient compared to cash bonuses and direct stock grants.
3. **[Performance Metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md)**: Companies can tie SARs to specific [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md), enhancing their role as performance-based incentives.

## Conclusion

Stock Appreciation Rights [offer](../o/offer.md) a flexible and powerful means of aligning employee incentives with company performance. Their use in compensation packages allows companies to attract and retain key talent while managing financial and regulatory impacts effectively. For employees, SARs provide a lower-[risk](../r/risk.md), potentially [lucrative](../l/lucrative.md) alternative to traditional stock [options](../o/options.md), [offering](../o/offering.md) immediate [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and less financial complexity.

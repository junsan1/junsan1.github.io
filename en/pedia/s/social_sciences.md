- Includes subfields like clinical, cognitive, and social psychology

### 3. Economics
- Analyzes production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services
- Includes microeconomics and macroeconomics

### 4. Political Science
- Studies governance, political behavior, and power relations
- Covers topics like political theory, comparative politics, and international relations

### 5. Anthropology
- Examines human cultures, societies, and evolution
- Includes cultural, biological, linguistic, and archaeological anthropology

### 6. Geography
- Studies spatial relations and processes on Earth's surface
- Includes physical and human geography

### 7. History
- Analyzes past events and their impact on societies
- Often considered a bridge between humanities and social sciences

## Research Methods

   - Surveys and questionnaires
   - Statistical analysis
   - Experimental designs

2. **Qualitative Methods**
   - Interviews
   - Participant observation
   - Case studies

3. **Mixed Methods**
   - Combining quantitative and qualitative approaches

## Key Concepts

- Social structures and institutions

   - Balancing scientific rigor with interpretive approaches

2. **Ethical Considerations**
   - Ensuring research respects human rights and privacy

3. **Replication Crisis**
   - Addressing issues of reproducibility in research findings

4. **Interdisciplinary Integration**
   - Bridging gaps between different social science disciplines

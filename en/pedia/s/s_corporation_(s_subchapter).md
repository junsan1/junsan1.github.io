# S Corporation (S Subchapter)

The S [Corporation](../c/corporation.md), often referred to as S Subchapter, is an appealing entity structure for many small [business](../b/business.md) owners in the United States due to its tax advantages and legal protections. The "S" designation comes from Subchapter S of Chapter 1 of the Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Code (IRC), which outlines the criteria and benefits of this corporate structure. Let's delve deep into the specifics of what an S [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) is, its benefits, requirements, election process, limitations, potential disadvantages, and its comparison with other [business](../b/business.md) structures.

## What is an S Corporation?

An S [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) is a type of [corporation](../c/corporation.md) that meets specific Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Code requirements. By [default](../d/default.md), corporations are taxed at the entity level, which can lead to [double taxation](../d/double_taxation.md). However, S Corporations pass corporate [income](../i/income.md), losses, deductions, and credits through to their shareholders for federal tax purposes. This eliminates the [double taxation](../d/double_taxation.md) scenario where [income](../i/income.md) is taxed both at the corporate level and again at the individual level when dividends are distributed to shareholders.

## Tax Advantages

### Pass-Through Taxation

One of the foremost benefits of an S [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) is pass-through [taxation](../t/taxation.md). Profits and losses are passed through directly to shareholders without being subject to [corporate tax](../c/corporate_tax.md) rates. This can significantly reduce the overall tax burden on the [business](../b/business.md):

- **Example**: Suppose an S [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) earns $100,000 in [profit](../p/profit.md). This [income](../i/income.md) is reported on the [personal income](../p/personal_income.md) tax returns of the shareholders based on their shareholding percentages. If there are two shareholders holding equal [shares](../s/shares.md), each would report $50,000 on their individual tax returns.

### Deductible Losses

Another [tax benefit](../t/tax_benefit.md) is the ability to deduct [business](../b/business.md) losses on personal tax returns. This is particularly beneficial for startups or businesses experiencing growth pains, as it allows shareholders to [offset](../o/offset.md) other [income](../i/income.md) sources with [business](../b/business.md) losses.

## Legal Protections

### Limited Liability

Owners (shareholders) of S Corporations enjoy [limited liability](../l/limited_liability.md) protection, meaning their personal assets are generally protected from [business](../b/business.md) creditors. This protection shields [personal property](../p/personal_property.md), such as homes and vehicles, provided that the corporate veil is not pierced.

### Separate Entity

An S [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) is a separate legal entity from its owners, providing a formal structure that can enhance the credibility of the [business](../b/business.md). Contracts, assets, and liabilities are held in the [corporation](../c/corporation.md)’s name rather than in the name of the shareholders.

## Requirements

To qualify as an S [Corporation](../c/corporation.md), a [business](../b/business.md) must meet the following criteria set forth by the IRS:

1. **Be a [Domestic Corporation](../d/domestic_corporation.md)**: The [business](../b/business.md) must be a legally recognized [corporation](../c/corporation.md) in the United States.
2. **Have Only Allowable Shareholders**: Shareholders must be individuals, certain trusts, and estates. Partnerships, corporations, and non-resident aliens are not permitted.
3. **Have No More Than 100 Shareholders**: This limitation maintains the small-[business](../b/business.md) character of S Corporations.
4. **Have One Class of Stock**: All [shares](../s/shares.md) must confer identical rights to [distribution](../d/distribution.md) and [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md).
5. **Not Be an Ineligible [Corporation](../c/corporation.md)**: Certain businesses, such as [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies, international sales corporations, and some financial institutions, are ineligible for S [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) status.

## Election Process

Electing S [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) status involves filing Form 2553, Election by a Small [Business](../b/business.md) [Corporation](../c/corporation.md), with the IRS. Here is the typical process:

1. **Form 2553 Submission**: Submit a completed Form 2553 signed by all shareholders.
2. **Within Deadline**: The form must be filed no more than two months and 15 days after the beginning of the tax year the election is to take effect.
3. **IRS Approval**: Once submitted, the IRS [will](../w/will.md) review the election to ensure all criteria are met and notify the [corporation](../c/corporation.md) of the approval.

## Limitations

While S Corporations [offer](../o/offer.md) enticing benefits, there are several limitations to be aware of:

1. **Stock Restrictions**: S Corporations can [issue](../i/issue.md) only one class of stock, which limits flexibility in [equity](../e/equity.md) [distribution](../d/distribution.md).
2. **[Shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) Limits**: The cap of 100 shareholders can be restrictive for growth and attracting diverse investors.
3. **Eligibility Issues**: Restrictions on allowable shareholders can complicate ownership structures.

## Potential Disadvantages

In addition to limitations, S Corporations have potential disadvantages:

1. **Compliance Requirements**: S Corporations must adhere to rigorous operational formalities similar to traditional C Corporations, including holding annual [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) meetings, keeping minutes, and maintaining corporate bylaws.
2. **[Self-Employment](../s/self-employment.md) [Taxes](../t/taxes.md)**: Shareholders may be subject to [self-employment](../s/self-employment.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) on their share of the [business](../b/business.md) [income](../i/income.md).
3. **Loss of Status**: Failing to comply with eligibility criteria (e.g., exceeding 100 shareholders) can result in the automatic [reversal](../r/reversal.md) to a [C Corporation](../c/c_corporation.md), which can have negative tax implications.

## Comparison with Other Business Structures

### C Corporation

- **[Taxation](../t/taxation.md)**: C Corporations are subject to [double taxation](../d/double_taxation.md) at both the corporate and individual levels on dividends.
- **Flexibility**: They can have unlimited shareholders and [multiple](../m/multiple.md) classes of stock, making them suitable for larger businesses and diverse [equity](../e/equity.md) arrangements.
- **[Investor](../i/investor.md) Appeal**: Often more attractive to investors and [venture capital](../v/venture_capital.md) due to the stock structure and ability to scale.

### LLC (Limited Liability Company)

- **[Taxation](../t/taxation.md)**: LLCs [offer](../o/offer.md) flexible [taxation](../t/taxation.md) [options](../o/options.md), including pass-through [taxation](../t/taxation.md), similar to S Corporations.
- **Flexibility**: Significant operational flexibility with fewer formal compliance requirements.
- **Members**: LLCs can have an unlimited number of members and different classes of membership.

### Sole Proprietorship

- **[Taxation](../t/taxation.md)**: Simple pass-through [taxation](../t/taxation.md), where [business](../b/business.md) [income](../i/income.md) is reported on the individual’s [tax return](../t/tax_return.md).
- **[Liability](../l/liability.md)**: No [limited liability](../l/limited_liability.md) protection, meaning personal assets are at [risk](../r/risk.md).
- **Compliance**: Minimal formalities and compliance requirements.

### Partnership

- **[Taxation](../t/taxation.md)**: Pass-through [taxation](../t/taxation.md) where profits and losses are reported on individual partners' tax returns.
- **Flexibility**: Extensive operational flexibility with respect to management and [profit distribution](../p/profit_distribution.md).
- **[Liability](../l/liability.md)**: [Limited Liability](../l/limited_liability.md) Partnerships (LLPs) provide [liability](../l/liability.md) protection, but general partnerships do not.

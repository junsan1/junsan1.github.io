### Risk Management

Identifying the risk factors associated with each sector allows investors to manage their portfolios better. Some sectors, like technology, might show high growth but also high volatility, whereas others, like utilities, provide more stable but lower returns.

### Performance Analysis

Comparing the performance of different sectors can offer insights into market trends and economic conditions. Performance analysis often involves looking at historical data, growth rates, and earnings to predict future movements.

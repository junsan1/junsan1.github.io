# Sunk Cost

In the realm of [finance](../f/finance.md) and [economics](../e/economics.md), the term "sunk cost" refers to a cost that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered. These costs are independent of any subsequent events or decisions, making them a unique and critical concept for decision-making processes in [business](../b/business.md), investment, and daily life. Understanding and properly [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for sunk costs can significantly influence the outcomes of financial strategies and operations, especially in trading, [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md), and entrepreneurial ventures.

## Definition and Characteristics

### Definition

A sunk cost is an expenditure that has been made and cannot be recuperated regardless of any future action. Classic examples include:

- The cost of machinery or equipment that has already been purchased and installed.
- Research and development expenses that have already been accrued.
- Advertising expenditures that have already been spent.

Importantly, since these costs cannot be reversed, they should not influence ongoing or future [business](../b/business.md) decisions. However, overcoming the psychological inclination to [factor](../f/factor.md) them in is often challenging.

### Characteristics

#### Irrecoverability

The pivotal characteristic of sunk costs is that they are irrecoverable. Once the [expense](../e/expense.md) is made, there is no feasible way to recoup the [money](../m/money.md) spent, rendering it a non-variable [factor](../f/factor.md) in forthcoming decisions.

#### Retrospective Nature

Sunk costs are retrospective by nature, meaning they relate to past expenditures. They stand in contrast to prospective costs, which are future costs that a [business](../b/business.md) anticipates incurring.

#### Decision Irrelevance

In principle, sunk costs should be irrelevant to future decision making. Rational economic actors are expected to make decisions based on marginal costs and benefits, ignoring past, irrecoverable expenses. However, human behavior often deviates from this rationality due to [cognitive biases](../c/cognitive_biases_in_trading.md).

## The Sunk Cost Fallacy

### Psychological Basis

The sunk cost fallacy is a cognitive bias that describes the tendency for people to continue an endeavor once an investment in [money](../m/money.md), effort, or time has been made, even when the cost outweighs the benefits. This fallacy is rooted in a psychological difficulty in accepting losses, and an inclination to justify past investments.

### Examples in Business Context

#### Project Continuation

A company continues funding a project despite poor performance because it has already invested significant resources into it. Abandoning the project would mean writing off the investment as a loss, hence, they persist under the fallacy that more investment [will](../w/will.md) eventually turn the tides.

#### Stock Market Behavior

Traders may [hold](../h/hold.md) onto an underperforming stock because they have already invested substantial amounts into it. The rational move would be to sell the stock if forecasts remain negative, however, they may irrationally [hold](../h/hold.md) onto it expecting a rebound that justifies their previous investment.

### Avoiding the Fallacy

#### Awareness and Training

Educating stakeholders about the sunk cost fallacy and its implications is fundamental. By raising awareness, businesses can foster a culture of rational decision-making where past expenditures are considered immutable and should not influence future decisions.

#### Decision Frameworks

Implementing structured decision-making frameworks that emphasize forward-looking criteria over past costs. This might include cost-benefit analyses or employing decision support systems that can model various future scenarios without retrospective bias.

## Sunk Costs in Corporate Finance

### Capital Budgeting

In [capital budgeting](../c/capital_budgeting.md), the focus lies on evaluating prospective cash flows and the potential [return](../r/return.md) on investment (ROI). Sunk costs should be entirely excluded from these calculations to ensure objective analysis of project viability.

### Merger and Acquisition (M&A) Decisions

During M&A activities, sunk costs like prior investments in acquired entities' [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md) or initial [offer](../o/offer.md) costs should not impact the [valuation](../v/valuation.md) and [negotiation](../n/negotiation.md) processes of prospective deals.

### Financial Reporting

[Accounting](../a/accounting.md) standards [demand](../d/demand.md) that businesses do not [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) sunk costs as assets on the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md). These costs should be expensed when incurred to reflect accurate [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and performance.

## Applications in Trading

### Algorithmic Trading

In [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), decision models and algorithms are designed to respond solely to current [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md) and prospective returns, explicitly ignoring past expenses as sunk costs. This approach enhances the pursuit of optimal [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) focused on future profitability.

### Risk Management

Effective [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) involves distinguishing between avoidable and unavoidable losses. Recognizing sunk costs allows traders to cut losses and reconfigure portfolios based on anticipated [market](../m/market.md) behavior rather than historical expenditures.

## Conclusion

### Rational Decision-Making

Mastering the concept of sunk costs is pivotal for rational decision-making. By consciously setting aside these costs, businesses, investors, and individuals can avoid the sunk cost fallacy and optimize their operational and financial strategies.

### Strategic Importance

In high-stakes domains like trading and [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md), the strategic exclusion of sunk costs from present and future considerations strengthens economic rationality, mitigates [risk](../r/risk.md), and supports sound financial projections.

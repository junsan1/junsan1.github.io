# Simulated Annealing in Algorithmic Trading

Simulated annealing is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function. It is often used when the search space is discrete, for instance, in combinatorial optimization problems, and finds extensive application in fields such as network design, circuit layout, and most importantly, in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). [Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) (or "algo trading") utilizes computer algorithms to automatically make trading decisions, submitting orders, and managing trades in financial markets. 

Simulated annealing is inspired by the physical process of annealing in metallurgy, where a material is heated to a high temperature and then gradually cooled in a controlled manner to alter its physical properties and reduce defects. Similarly, in the optimization context, simulated annealing gradually reduces the temperature of a system to minimize an objective function while allowing occasional worsening moves to escape local optima.

## Key Components of Simulated Annealing

1. **Temperature Schedule (Cooling Schedule):**
   The temperature controls the probability of accepting worse solutions as the algorithm progresses. The schedule determines how the temperature is lowered over time. A common schedule is geometric cooling, which reduces the temperature by a constant factor at each iteration.

2. **Neighbourhood Function:**
   Defines the local area in the solution space to explore. For example, in a trading strategy, a neighbourhood function may involve small tweaks to parameters such as entry and exit points or stop-loss levels.

3. **Acceptance Probability:**
   Determines the likelihood of accepting a worse solution based on the difference in the cost between the current and new solutions and the current temperature. This is often managed using the Metropolis criterion, which accepts worse solutions with a probability \( \exp(-\Delta E / T) \).

4. **Objective Function:**
   The function to be minimized or maximized. In trading, this could be the [Sharpe ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md), total return, or another performance metric.

## Steps Involved in Simulated Annealing for Algorithmic Trading

1. **Initialization:**
   Start with an initial solution and set the initial temperature.

2. **Iteration:**
   - Generate a neighbouring solution.
   - Calculate the change in the objective function.
   - Determine whether to accept the new solution based on acceptance probability.
   - Adjust the temperature according to the cooling schedule.

3. **Termination:**
   The process continues until a termination criterion is met. This could be a fixed number of iterations, a solution that meets a pre-defined quality threshold, or a temperature below a certain level.

## Application in Algorithmic Trading

In [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), simulated annealing can optimize numerous trading strategy components. Here are some specific applications:

### 1. Parameter Optimization

[Trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) often involve multiple parameters like moving average periods, relative strength index (RSI) thresholds, and stop-loss levels. Simulated annealing can find the optimal combination of these parameters to maximize returns or minimize risk.

### 2. Portfolio Optimization

Beyond individual strategies, it can be used to optimize [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) within a portfolio. Traditionally, the Markowitz Mean-Variance Framework is used, but simulated annealing offers a flexible alternative that can handle more complex, [non-linear optimization](../n/non-linear_optimization.md) problems.

### 3. Strategy Development

Simulated annealing can assist in the development of new [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) by searching for combinations of rules and conditions that best capture market inefficiencies.

### 4. Algorithm Calibration

Given the importance of parameter stability in live trading, simulated annealing can be employed to ensure that parameters set during training are resilient to market changes, thereby reducing overfitting.

## Example: Applying Simulated Annealing to a Moving Average Crossover Strategy

Let's consider a basic moving average crossover strategy where we aim to optimize the short-term and long-term moving average periods.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from random import randint, uniform
import yfinance as yf

# Objective Function: Return of strategy
def calculate_return(params, data):
    short_window, long_window = params
    data['short_mavg'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=short_window).mean()
    data['long_mavg'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=long_window).mean()
    data['signal'] = 0.0
    data['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(data['short_mavg'][short_window:] > data['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)
    data['positions'] = data['signal'].diff()
    initial_capital = float(100000.0)
    positions = pd.DataFrame(index=data.index).fillna(0.0)
    positions['AAPL'] = data['signal']
    portfolio = positions.multiply(data['Close'], axis=0)
    pos_diff = positions.diff()
    portfolio['holdings'] = positions.multiply(data['Close'], axis=0).sum(axis=1)
    portfolio['cash'] = initial_capital - (pos_diff.multiply(data['Close'], axis=0)).sum(axis=1).cumsum()
    portfolio['total'] = portfolio['cash'] + portfolio['holdings']
    portfolio['returns'] = portfolio['total'].pct_change()
    return portfolio['returns'].sum()

# Simulated Annealing
def simulated_annealing(data, initial_temp, cooling_rate, stopping_temp, steps):
    current_params = [randint(5, 15), randint(20, 50)]
    current_cost = -calculate_return(current_params, data)
    current_temp = initial_temp

    while current_temp > stopping_temp:
        new_params = [current_params[0] + randint(-2, 2), current_params[1] + randint(-5, 5)]
        new_params = [max(1, x) for x in new_params]  # Ensure moving periods are positive
        new_cost = -calculate_return(new_params, data)
        
        if new_cost < current_cost or uniform(0, 1) < np.exp((current_cost - new_cost) / current_temp):
            current_params = new_params
            current_cost = new_cost

        current_temp *= cooling_rate
    
    return current_params

ticker = 'AAPL'
data = yf.download(ticker, start="2020-01-01", end="2023-01-01")
optimized_params = simulated_annealing(data, initial_temp=10000, cooling_rate=0.99, stopping_temp=1, steps=1000)
print("Optimized Short and Long Window Parameters:", optimized_params)

```

In this example:
- We download historical data for Apple (AAPL) using yfinance.
- Define an objective function (`calculate_return`) for the moving average crossover strategy that calculates the total return.
- Implement simulated annealing (`simulated_annealing`), which optimizes the period for short and long moving averages.
- The script attempts to find the optimal short and long moving average window periods to maximize the strategy's return.

## Advantages & Challenges

### Advantages:
- **Escaping Local Optima:** Simulated annealingâ€™s acceptance probability for worse solutions helps the algorithm escape local minima, seeking a more globally optimal solution.
- **Flexibility:** It can handle complex objective functions, various constraints, and multifaceted parameter spaces, making it a versatile choice for trading strategy optimization.
- **Simplicity:** The algorithm is relatively straightforward to implement and does not require gradient information or complex [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md).

### Challenges:
- **Parameter Tuning:** The performance of simulated annealing highly depends on the cooling schedule and acceptance criteria, necessitating careful tuning.
- **Computationally Intensive:** Given the stochastic nature, numerous iterations and evaluations of the objective function can be computationally expensive, especially for [real-time trading systems](../r/real-time_trading_systems.md).
- **Convergence Time:** Finding a global optimum can take considerable time, making it less suitable for very fast, high-frequency trading applications.

## Conclusion

Simulated annealing presents a powerful, flexible optimization tool for [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). Its ability to navigate complex and rugged landscapes of trading strategy parameters makes it a valuable method for traders seeking to optimize their [trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md). Despite its advantages, practitioners should be mindful of the computational demands and the necessity for careful tuning to fully harness the benefits of simulated annealing in their [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) endeavors.

# Strangle

A strangle is an advanced [options](../o/options.md) [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) that involves the simultaneous purchase or [sale](../s/sale.md) of both a call and a [put option](../p/put.md) with the same [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md) but different strike prices. This approach allows traders to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on significant price movements in an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), regardless of the direction of the move. The key difference between a strangle and a similar strategy known as a [straddle](../s/straddle.md) is that, in a strangle, the strike prices of the call and [put options](../p/put_options.md) are different.

## Introduction to the Strangle Strategy

### Defining the Strangle

In a strangle strategy, the [trader](../t/trader.md) buys ([long strangle](../l/long_strangle.md)) or sells ([short strangle](../s/short_strangle.md)) both an out-of-the-[money](../m/money.md) call and an out-of-the-[money](../m/money.md) [put option](../p/put.md). These [options](../o/options.md) have identical expiration dates but different strike prices, which are usually equidistant from the current price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). For instance, consider an [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock trading at $100. A [trader](../t/trader.md) might buy a $105 [call option](../c/call_option.md) and a $95 [put option](../p/put.md) simultaneously. This setup allows the [trader](../t/trader.md) to [profit](../p/profit.md) from large price movements without knowing the direction of those movements beforehand.

### Long Strangle

- **Objective**: The [trader](../t/trader.md) aims to [profit](../p/profit.md) from significant [volatility](../v/volatility.md) in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).
- **[Execution](../e/execution.md)**: Purchase an out-of-the-[money](../m/money.md) call and an out-of-the-[money](../m/money.md) put.
- **Cost**: The total cost is the sum of the premiums paid for both [options](../o/options.md).
- **[Profit](../p/profit.md) Potential**: Unlimited potential on the [upside](../u/upside.md) (due to the [call option](../c/call_option.md)) and substantial on the downside (subject to the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) going to zero).
- **[Risk](../r/risk.md)**: The maximum [risk](../r/risk.md) is limited to the total [premium](../p/premium.md) paid.

### Short Strangle

- **Objective**: The [trader](../t/trader.md) aims to [profit](../p/profit.md) from low [volatility](../v/volatility.md), expecting the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) to remain stable.
- **[Execution](../e/execution.md)**: Sell an out-of-the-[money](../m/money.md) call and an out-of-the-[money](../m/money.md) put.
- **Cost**: The [trader](../t/trader.md) receives the total premiums from selling both [options](../o/options.md).
- **[Profit](../p/profit.md) Potential**: Limited to the total premiums received.
- **[Risk](../r/risk.md)**: Potentially [unlimited risk](../u/unlimited_risk.md) on the [upside](../u/upside.md) (due to the [call option](../c/call_option.md)) and substantial on the downside (subject to the price falling significantly due to the [put option](../p/put.md)).

## Mechanics of a Strangle

### Premium Calculation

The [premium](../p/premium.md) of an option is its price in the [market](../m/market.md). For a strangle, the combined [premium](../p/premium.md) is the sum of the premiums for both the call and [put options](../p/put_options.md). The size of the [premium](../p/premium.md) directly affects the potential [profit](../p/profit.md) and loss of the strangle [trade](../t/trade.md). 

### Breakeven Points

For a [long strangle](../l/long_strangle.md), the breakeven points are calculated as follows:
- **Upper [Breakeven Point](../b/breakeven_point.md)**: [Strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of the [call option](../c/call_option.md) + Total [premium](../p/premium.md) paid.
- **Lower [Breakeven Point](../b/breakeven_point.md)**: [Strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of the [put option](../p/put.md) - Total [premium](../p/premium.md) paid.

For a [short strangle](../s/short_strangle.md), the breakeven points are:
- **Upper [Breakeven Point](../b/breakeven_point.md)**: [Strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of the [call option](../c/call_option.md) + Total [premium](../p/premium.md) received.
- **Lower [Breakeven Point](../b/breakeven_point.md)**: [Strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of the [put option](../p/put.md) - Total [premium](../p/premium.md) received.

### Profit and Loss

#### Long Strangle:
- **[Profit](../p/profit.md)**: Realized when the price moves significantly above the upper [breakeven point](../b/breakeven_point.md) or significantly below the lower [breakeven point](../b/breakeven_point.md).
- **Loss**: Limited to the total [premium](../p/premium.md) paid. Occurs when the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price stays between the strike prices of the two [options](../o/options.md).

#### Short Strangle:
- **[Profit](../p/profit.md)**: Limited to the total [premium](../p/premium.md) received. Occurs when the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price stays between the strike prices of the two [options](../o/options.md).
- **Loss**: Potentially unlimited if the price moves significantly above or below the breakeven points.

## Use Cases and Market Conditions

### Volatility

A strangle strategy is highly dependent on [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md). For a [long strangle](../l/long_strangle.md), traders exploit high [volatility](../v/volatility.md), which can lead to large price swings. Conversely, a [short strangle](../s/short_strangle.md) benefits from low [volatility](../v/volatility.md) or a stable [market](../m/market.md) scenario where significant price changes are unlikely.

### Earnings Reports and Major Announcements

Long strangles are particularly popular around major corporate announcements or [earnings](../e/earnings.md) reports. These events tend to cause substantial price movements, and a [long strangle](../l/long_strangle.md) strategy can [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on such [volatility](../v/volatility.md) without predicting the direction of the movement.

### Limitations

#### High Premium Costs

The main limitation of a [long strangle](../l/long_strangle.md) is the high [premium](../p/premium.md) costs. Since the strategy involves buying two [options](../o/options.md), the upfront cost can be substantial, making the strategy less attractive if the anticipated [volatility](../v/volatility.md) does not materialize.

#### Risk of Unlimited Losses

For a [short strangle](../s/short_strangle.md), the potential for unlimited losses makes it a highly risky strategy, suitable only for experienced traders with a strong assessment of [market](../m/market.md) stability. 

## Advanced Strategies

### Iron Condor

An [iron condor](../i/iron_condor.md) is a more advanced strategy that builds on the principles of a strangle. It involves the purchase and [sale](../s/sale.md) of four [options](../o/options.md) with different strike prices. Essentially, it combines a [bull put spread](../b/bull_put_spread.md) and a [bear call spread](../b/bear_call_spread.md) to limit both the potential [profit](../p/profit.md) and the [risk](../r/risk.md). This strategy offers a way to execute a strangle-like approach but with capped [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Adjustments and Rollovers

Traders often adjust their strangle positions based on [market](../m/market.md) conditions. Adjustments can involve rolling [options](../o/options.md) to later dates, changing strike prices, or converting the position into a different strategy to manage risks and [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on new [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

## Real-World Examples

### Example of a Long Strangle

- **[Underlying Asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)**: Stock trading at $100
- **[Options](../o/options.md) Purchased**: 
  - $105 Call [option premium](../o/option_premium.md): $2
  - $95 Put [option premium](../o/option_premium.md): $3
- **Total [Premium](../p/premium.md) Paid**: $2 + $3 = $5
- **Breakeven Points**: 
  - Upper: $105 + $5 = $110
  - Lower: $95 - $5 = $90

If the stock price moves to $115, the [profit](../p/profit.md) [will](../w/will.md) be ($115 - $105) - $5 = $5.

### Example of a Short Strangle

- **[Underlying Asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)**: Stock trading at $100
- **[Options](../o/options.md) Sold**: 
  - $105 Call [option premium](../o/option_premium.md): $2
  - $95 Put [option premium](../o/option_premium.md): $3
- **Total [Premium](../p/premium.md) Received**: $2 + $3 = $5
- **Breakeven Points**: 
  - Upper: $105 + $5 = $110
  - Lower: $95 - $5 = $90

If the stock price stays at $100, the [profit](../p/profit.md) [will](../w/will.md) be the total [premium](../p/premium.md) received = $5.

## Tools and Platforms

Many trading platforms and tools exist to assist traders in executing strangle strategies. Among them, [automated trading systems](../a/automated_trading_systems.md) and [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) have become increasingly popular. These systems can be programmed to place strangle trades when certain [market](../m/market.md) conditions are met, removing the need for manual intervention. 

### Tools for Analysis

## Regulatory Considerations

[Options](../o/options.md) trading is subject to regulatory oversight to ensure fair practices and [transparency](../t/transparency.md). Regulatory bodies such as the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) in the United States impose specific rules on [options](../o/options.md) trading. Traders must adhere to [margin](../m/margin.md) requirements, [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md), and reporting standards. Understanding these regulations is crucial for both legal compliance and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md).

## Conclusion

The strangle is a versatile [options](../o/options.md) [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) that appeals to traders seeking to [profit](../p/profit.md) from significant price movements in an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), irrespective of the direction. By understanding its mechanics, use cases, and limitations, traders can deploy strangles effectively to align with their [market](../m/market.md) outlook and [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md). Whether executed manually or through [automated trading systems](../a/automated_trading_systems.md), strangles [offer](../o/offer.md) a compelling approach for navigating both volatile and stable [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

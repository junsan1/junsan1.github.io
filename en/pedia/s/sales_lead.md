# Sales Lead

A sales lead is a prospective consumer or potential [customer](../c/customer.md) who has expressed [interest](../i/interest.md) in the products or services a [business](../b/business.md) offers.

## Types of Sales Leads

They require nurturing and further engagement to become Sales Qualified Leads (SQL).

### Sales Qualified Leads (SQL)

SQLs are leads that have been vetted by the sales team and are deemed ready for the next stage of the sales process.

## Lead Generation

### Lead Scoring

This helps prioritize leads and focuses efforts on the most promising opportunities. Scores can be calculated using criteria such as engagement level, demographic information, company size, and [industry](../i/industry.md).

## Lead Nurturing

Lead nurturing comprises building relationships with potential customers throughout the sales funnel. Effective lead nurturing necessitates understanding the buyer’s journey and delivering the right content at the appropriate time.

CRM platforms like Salesforce (https://www.salesforce.com/) and HubSpot (https://www.hubspot.com/) [offer](../o/offer.md) sophisticated tools for tracking, scoring, and nurturing leads, automating processes, and integrating with other [business](../b/business.md) systems.

## Key Metrics

### Conversion Rate

The conversion rate tracks the percentage of leads moving from one stage of the funnel to the next. This helps identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement within the sales process.

### Cost Per Lead (CPL)

### Lead Velocity Rate (LVR)

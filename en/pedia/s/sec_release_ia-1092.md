# SEC Release IA-1092

## Introduction

SEC Release IA-1092, formally known as the "Interpretation of Section 202(a)(11) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940," is a defining document issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on October 8, 1987. This release sought to clarify and interpret various aspects of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, particularly in the context of individuals and entities providing financial and investment advice. The provision of this release is often examined in the realm of financial advising and algotrading.

## Background

### The Investment Advisers Act of 1940

The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Advisers Act") is key legislation that governs the activities of investment advisers in the United States. It establishes the definition, registration requirements, and fiduciary responsibilities of investment advisers. The primary purposes of this act are to protect investors and promote trust in the securities industry.

### Need for SEC Release IA-1092

Over time, ambiguities arose concerning who precisely qualifies as an "investment adviser" under the Advisers Act. This was especially true with the advent of new financial products and advisory services. To address these uncertainties, the SEC issued Release IA-1092 to provide specific guidance and delineate the scope of who must register under the Act.

## Core Provisions of SEC Release IA-1092

### Definition Clarification

SEC Release IA-1092 clarifies that the term "investment adviser" applies to any person or entity that:

1. **Provides Advice or Analyses Concerning Securities**: This includes those who provide advice, issue reports, or analyses regarding securities.
2. **Engages in the Business of Providing Such Services**: The person or entity must be in the business of advising others, directly or through publications, with respect to securities.
3. **Receives Compensation for Such Services**: There must be financial remuneration involved, whether directly from clients or through other means.

### Broad Scope of Application

The release broadened the scope of entities considered as investment advisers by including:

- Financial planners.
- Pension consultants.
- Sports and entertainment representatives.
- Any person or firm that provides advice about investing in securities for compensation.

### Specific Exclusions

While Release IA-1092 expanded the definition, it also identified specific exclusions:

- **Lawyers, Accountants, Engineers, and Teachers (The "L.A.T.E" Exclusion)**: Provided that their advice is incidental to their profession.
- **Broker-Dealers**: Provided that their advisory services are incidental to their brokerage business and they receive no special compensation for advisory services.
  
### Fiduciary Duty

One of the critical interpretations provided by the release is the fiduciary duty owed by investment advisers to their clients. This entails acting in the best interest of clients and making full disclosure of any potential conflicts of interest.

### Portfolio Management and Financial Planning

Given the proliferation of financial planning services during the 1980s, the release clarified that individuals and entities offering comprehensive financial planning and portfolio management services are subject to the Advisers Act.

### Directors and Employees

SEC Release IA-1092 stipulates that even directors and employees of a company who provide investment advice as part of their roles are considered investment advisers if they meet the criteria outlined.

## Impact on Algotrading

### Algotrading Defined

Algorithmic trading, or algotrading, refers to the use of algorithms to pre-program trading instructions for executing orders in financial markets. These algorithms can process large volumes of market data and execute trades at speeds beyond human capability.

### Classification of Algotrading Entities

Given the criteria in SEC Release IA-1092, many entities and individuals involved in algotrading may qualify as investment advisers if their algorithms involve advising, promoting, or making investment decisions on securities, and if they engage in this as a business and receive compensation. This could include:

- **Entities providing algorithm-based advisory services**: Firms that develop and sell algorithmic strategies to clients.
- **Robo-Advisors**: Automated platforms offering portfolio management using algorithms.
- **Research Firms**: Companies providing algorithmic analyses and reports on securities.

### Registration and Compliance

Entities and individuals involved in algotrading that qualify as investment advisers under IA-1092 must:

1. **Register with the SEC**: They must complete Form ADV, detailing the nature of their business, the services they offer, and any conflicts of interest.
2. **Adhere to Fiduciary Duties**: Ensure that they act in the best interests of their clients and disclose any conflicts.
3. **Comply with Reporting Requirements**: Maintain records and provide periodic updates to the SEC.

## Compliance and Additional Resources

To ensure adherence to the provisions of SEC Release IA-1092, entities involved in investment advisory and algotrading should:

- **Consult the full text of the SEC Release IA-1092**: [SEC Release IA-1092 Full Text](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-1092)

## Conclusion

SEC Release IA-1092 continues to play a significant role in regulating the provision of investment advice in the United States. By clearly defining who qualifies as an investment adviser, the release ensures that entities providing advisory services, including those involved in modern practices like algotrading, adhere to fiduciary responsibilities and regulatory requirements designed to protect investors and maintain market integrity.

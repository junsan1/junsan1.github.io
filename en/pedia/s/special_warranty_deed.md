# Special Warranty Deed

A **Special [Warranty Deed](../w/warranty_deed.md)** is a type of legal instrument used to transfer property ownership from one individual or entity to another. This type of [deed](../d/deed.md) provides a middle-ground level of protection for the [grantee](../g/grantee.md) (the buyer) by ensuring that the [grantor](../g/grantor.md) (the seller) holds a clear title to the property being sold, but only [warrants](../w/warrants_in_trading.md) against defects that occurred during their period of ownership. In other words, the [grantor](../g/grantor.md) guarantees that no legal issues arose with the title of the property while they owned it but doesn't cover any problems that might have existed before their ownership.

## Understanding Special Warranty Deeds

Special [warranty](../w/warranty.md) deeds are commonly used in [commercial real estate](../c/commercial_real_estate.md) transactions but can also be employed in residential contexts. The main difference between a general [warranty deed](../w/warranty_deed.md) and a special [warranty deed](../w/warranty_deed.md) lies in the [scope](../s/scope.md) of protection. While a general [warranty deed](../w/warranty_deed.md) covers the entire history of the property, a special [warranty deed](../w/warranty_deed.md) limits its cover to the period during which the [grantor](../g/grantor.md) owned the property.

### Key Components of a Special Warranty Deed

1. **[Grantor](../g/grantor.md) and [Grantee](../g/grantee.md) Information**: Names and addresses of the seller ([grantor](../g/grantor.md)) and buyer ([grantee](../g/grantee.md)).
2. **Property Description**: A legal description of the property being conveyed, including address, lot, and block details.
3. **Conveyance Language**: Phrasing that specifies the transfer of property ownership.
4. **[Warranty](../w/warranty.md) Language**: Declarations from the [grantor](../g/grantor.md) assuring that the property was not encumbered during their ownership except as noted.
5. **[Execution](../e/execution.md) by [Grantor](../g/grantor.md) and Acknowledgment**: The [grantor](../g/grantor.md) must sign the [deed](../d/deed.md) in the presence of a notary public or other authorized official.

### Warranties and Guarantees

- **[Warrants](../w/warrants_in_trading.md) Against [Grantor](../g/grantor.md)’s Acts**: Assures that the [grantor](../g/grantor.md) has not taken any actions during their period of ownership that would negatively impact the [grantee](../g/grantee.md)'s title.
- **Protection Against Encumbrances**: Guarantees that there are no encumbrances, such as liens or easements, placed by the [grantor](../g/grantor.md) that have not been disclosed.

### Situations for Using Special Warranty Deeds

- **[Commercial Real Estate](../c/commercial_real_estate.md) Purchases**: Companies often use special [warranty](../w/warranty.md) deeds as they provide sufficient protection and are often acceptable given the complex nature of commercial property transactions.
- **[Beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md) Deeds**: Transfers made after the death of the property owner, specifying heirs without requiring [probate](../p/probate.md).
- **[Foreclosure](../f/foreclosure.md) Property Sales**: Lenders may use special [warranty](../w/warranty.md) deeds to transfer foreclosed properties as they want to limit their [liability](../l/liability.md) to the period of [foreclosure](../f/foreclosure.md).

## Limitations and Risks

The primary limitation of a special [warranty deed](../w/warranty_deed.md) is that it does not protect the buyer from title issues that existed before the [grantor](../g/grantor.md)’s period of ownership. Therefore, if there were any encumbrances, liens, or other title defects before the [grantor](../g/grantor.md) acquired the property, the buyer is not protected against these.

### Comparison with Other Deeds

- **General [Warranty Deed](../w/warranty_deed.md)**: Offers the highest level of protection, covering the entire history of the property.
- **[Quitclaim Deed](../q/quitclaim_deed.md)**: Provides no warranties; transfers any [interest](../i/interest.md) the [grantor](../g/grantor.md) may have in the property without guarantees.
- **Bargain and [Sale](../s/sale.md) [Deed](../d/deed.md)**: Similar to special [warranty](../w/warranty.md) deeds but typically used in tax sales and does not always provide specific warranties against the [grantor](../g/grantor.md)’s actions.

## How to Create a Special Warranty Deed

Creating a special [warranty deed](../w/warranty_deed.md) involves several steps, usually requiring legal expertise to ensure that the document adheres to state-specific requirements:

1. **Prepare the Document**: Include all necessary details, such as [grantor](../g/grantor.md)/[grantee](../g/grantee.md) information, property description, and [warranty](../w/warranty.md) language.
2. **Review by Legal Counsel**: Have the [deed](../d/deed.md) reviewed by an attorney to ensure compliance with local laws and regulations.
3. **[Execution](../e/execution.md)**: The [grantor](../g/grantor.md) signs the [deed](../d/deed.md) in front of a notary public.
4. **Recording**: Submit the [deed](../d/deed.md) to the local county recorder’s office to be officially recorded.

## Importance in Real Estate Transactions

Special [warranty](../w/warranty.md) deeds strike a balance by providing limited protection while transferring property interests. They allocate responsibilities between the buyer and seller, making them a viable option for various [transaction](../t/transaction.md) types.

### Here's why they're important:

1. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Help manage and limit the [liability](../l/liability.md) of sellers while [offering](../o/offering.md) buyers [assurance](../a/assurance.md) for the period of the [grantor](../g/grantor.md)’s ownership.
2. **Cost [Efficiency](../e/efficiency.md)**: Often involve lower costs compared to general [warranty](../w/warranty.md) deeds due to the reduced [scope](../s/scope.md) of [liability](../l/liability.md).
3. **Flexibility**: Used in different contexts, including trusts, estates, and commercial transactions.

### Conclusion

Special [warranty](../w/warranty.md) deeds are crucial in the realm of property transfer, providing protection specific to the [grantor](../g/grantor.md)’s period of ownership. Understanding their structure, implications, and appropriate usage scenarios can aid buyers and sellers in making informed decisions in [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) transactions.

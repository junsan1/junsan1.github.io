# Smart Beta

Smart Beta is an investment strategy that blends elements of traditional passive investing with active investing approaches. The primary goal of [Smart Beta strategies](../s/smart_beta_strategies.md) is to improve returns, reduce risk, and enhance the diversification of investments by using advanced criteria that deviate from conventional market capitalization-based indexes.

## Introduction

[Smart Beta strategies](../s/smart_beta_strategies.md) often use alternative weighting schemes based on various fundamental, technical, and value metrics, such as volatility, dividends, and revenue, among others. These strategies are designed to capitalize on specific factors consistently linked to superior risk-adjusted returns.

## Types of Smart Beta Strategies

### Fundamental Indexing

Fundamental indexing allocates weights based on fundamental criteria, such as dividends, earnings, book value, and sales. This method aims to provide a more rational investment approach compared to traditional market cap-weighted indices. For instance, companies with higher earnings or more significant dividends receive higher weights in a fundamental index.

### Equal Weighting

Equal weighting involves assigning equal weights to each of the index's constituents. This approach helps mitigate the concentration risk inherent in market-cap weighted indices, where a few large companies can dominate the index performance. Equal-weighted indices tend to have higher exposure to smaller companies, often overlooked in market-cap weighted indices.

### Low Volatility

Low-volatility strategies aim to invest in stocks with lower price fluctuations, providing more stable returns. This technique reduces exposure to risky assets and has historically offered better risk-adjusted returns. Low-volatility indices may focus on stocks with lower [historical volatility](../h/historical_volatility.md) or those exhibiting specific volatility patterns.

### Momentum

Momentum-based strategies focus on stocks that have demonstrated a strong upward price trend over a specific period. The rationale is that stocks with high recent performance will continue to outperform in the short-to-medium term. Momentum strategies often involve periodic rebalancing to maintain exposure to high-momentum stocks.

### Quality

Quality-driven [Smart Beta strategies](../s/smart_beta_strategies.md) prioritize investments in companies with superior quality metrics, such as high return on equity, stable earnings growth, or low debt levels. These strategies seek to capture the outperformance of high-quality companies over the long term while minimizing the risks associated with lower-quality firms.

### Yield

Yield-focused [Smart Beta strategies](../s/smart_beta_strategies.md) allocate investments based on dividend yields, aiming to provide consistent income streams. This approach can be especially appealing to income-seeking investors, as it focuses on stocks or assets delivering relatively higher dividends.

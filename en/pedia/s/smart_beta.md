# Smart Beta

Smart [Beta](../b/beta.md) is an [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) that blends elements of traditional [passive investing](../p/passive_investing.md) with active [investing](../i/investing.md) approaches. The primary goal of [Smart Beta strategies](../s/smart_beta_strategies.md) is to improve returns, reduce [risk](../r/risk.md), and enhance the [diversification](../d/diversification.md) of investments by using advanced criteria that deviate from conventional [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md)-based indexes.

## Introduction

[Smart Beta strategies](../s/smart_beta_strategies.md) often use alternative weighting schemes based on various fundamental, technical, and [value](../v/value.md) metrics, such as [volatility](../v/volatility.md), dividends, and [revenue](../r/revenue.md), among others. These strategies are designed to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on specific factors consistently linked to superior [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted returns.

## Types of Smart Beta Strategies

### Fundamental Indexing

Fundamental [indexing](../i/indexing.md) allocates weights based on fundamental criteria, such as dividends, [earnings](../e/earnings.md), [book value](../b/book_value.md), and sales. This method aims to provide a more rational investment approach compared to traditional [market](../m/market.md) cap-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) indices. For instance, companies with higher [earnings](../e/earnings.md) or more significant dividends receive higher weights in a fundamental [index](../i/index_instrument.md).

### Equal Weighting

Equal weighting involves assigning equal weights to each of the [index](../i/index_instrument.md)'s constituents. This approach helps mitigate the concentration [risk](../r/risk.md) inherent in [market](../m/market.md)-cap [weighted](../w/weighted.md) indices, where a few large companies can dominate the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) performance. Equal-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) indices tend to have higher exposure to smaller companies, often overlooked in [market](../m/market.md)-cap [weighted](../w/weighted.md) indices.

### Low Volatility

Low-[volatility](../v/volatility.md) strategies aim to invest in [stocks](../s/stock.md) with lower price fluctuations, providing more stable returns. This technique reduces exposure to risky assets and has historically offered better [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted returns. Low-[volatility](../v/volatility.md) indices may focus on [stocks](../s/stock.md) with lower [historical volatility](../h/historical_volatility.md) or those exhibiting specific [volatility](../v/volatility.md) patterns.

### Momentum

[Momentum](../m/momentum.md)-based strategies focus on [stocks](../s/stock.md) that have demonstrated a strong upward price [trend](../t/trend.md) over a specific period. The rationale is that [stocks](../s/stock.md) with high recent performance [will](../w/will.md) continue to [outperform](../o/outperform.md) in the short-to-medium term. [Momentum](../m/momentum.md) strategies often involve periodic [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) to maintain exposure to high-[momentum](../m/momentum.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md).

### Quality

Quality-driven [Smart Beta strategies](../s/smart_beta_strategies.md) prioritize investments in companies with superior quality metrics, such as high [return](../r/return.md) on [equity](../e/equity.md), stable [earnings](../e/earnings.md) growth, or low [debt](../d/debt.md) levels. These strategies seek to capture the outperformance of high-quality companies over the long term while minimizing the risks associated with lower-quality firms.

### Yield

[Yield](../y/yield.md)-focused [Smart Beta strategies](../s/smart_beta_strategies.md) allocate investments based on [dividend](../d/dividend.md) yields, aiming to provide consistent [income](../i/income.md) streams. This approach can be especially appealing to [income](../i/income.md)-seeking investors, as it focuses on [stocks](../s/stock.md) or assets delivering relatively higher dividends.

## Advantages of Smart Beta

- **Enhanced [Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: By employing alternative weighting methods and focusing on specific factors, [Smart Beta strategies](../s/smart_beta_strategies.md) can improve [portfolio diversification](../p/portfolio_diversification.md) compared to traditional [market](../m/market.md)-cap [weighted](../w/weighted.md) indices.
- **Improved Returns**: These strategies aim to capture specific [risk](../r/risk.md) premiums associated with various factors, potentially leading to superior returns over traditional [passive investing](../p/passive_investing.md).
- **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Reduction**: Many [Smart Beta strategies](../s/smart_beta_strategies.md), such as low-[volatility](../v/volatility.md) and quality-focused approaches, aim to reduce portfolio [risk](../r/risk.md) by focusing on less volatile or higher-quality securities.
- **[Transparency](../t/transparency.md)**: [Smart Beta strategies](../s/smart_beta_strategies.md) typically follow systematic, rules-based methodologies, which add a level of [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and predictability to investment decisions.

## Risks and Challenges

- **Potential for Underperformance**: Although [Smart Beta strategies](../s/smart_beta_strategies.md) aim to [outperform](../o/outperform.md) traditional indices, there can be periods when specific factors [underperform](../u/underperform.md) the [market](../m/market.md).
- **Complexity**: The strategies often involve complex methodologies, which may be challenging for some investors to understand and implement.
- **Cost**: [Smart Beta strategies](../s/smart_beta_strategies.md) might involve higher costs than traditional passive funds due to the need for [active management](../a/active_management.md) in selecting and [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) assets.

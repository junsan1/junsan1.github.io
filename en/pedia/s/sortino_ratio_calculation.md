# Sortino Ratio Calculation

The **[Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md)** is a financial metric that differentiates between good and bad [volatility](../v/volatility.md) in the assessment of an investment's [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted returns. While the widely-used [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) considers all [variability](../v/variability.md) in returns as [risk](../r/risk.md), the [Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md) focuses specifically on [downside risk](../d/downside_risk.md), providing a more nuanced view of an investment's performance. This is particularly useful for investors who are more concerned about downside events than [upside](../u/upside.md) [variability](../v/variability.md). 

### Components of the Sortino Ratio

To understand the [Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md), one needs to be familiar with its primary components:

1. **[Expected Return](../e/expected_return.md) (\( R \))**: This is the mean [return](../r/return.md) of an investment over a specified period.
  
2. **[Risk](../r/risk.md)-Free Rate (\( R_f \))**: Typically, this is the [return](../r/return.md) of an investment considered "[risk](../r/risk.md)-free," such as [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) bonds.
  
3. **[Downside Deviation](../d/downside_deviation.md) (\( DD \))**: Unlike [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) that considers all deviations, [downside deviation](../d/downside_deviation.md) only considers returns that fall below a targeted or minimum acceptable [return](../r/return.md) (MAR).

### Formula

The [Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md) is calculated using the following formula:

\[
\text{[Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md)} = \frac{R - R_f}{DD}
\]

Where:
- \( R \) is the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) of the investment.
- \( R_f \) is the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate.
- \( DD \) is the [downside deviation](../d/downside_deviation.md).

### Calculation Steps

#### 1. Define the Time Period

Choose the period over which you want to analyze the investment returns, such as daily, monthly, or yearly returns. The chosen period should align with your [investment horizon](../i/investment_horizon.md) and [risk](../r/risk.md) preferences.

#### 2. Calculate the Mean Return (\( R \))

Sum the periodic returns and divide by the number of periods to find the [average return](../a/average_return.md).

\[
R = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} R_i}{n}
\]

Where:
- \( \sum \) denotes the summation of returns.
- \( R_i \) represents the [return](../r/return.md) in each period.
- \( n \) is the number of periods.

#### 3. Determine the Minimum Acceptable Return (MAR)

The MAR is often set at the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate (\( R_f \)), but it can be adjusted based on the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s target [return](../r/return.md) or other benchmarks. 

#### 4. Calculate the Downside Deviation (\( DD \))

[Downside Deviation](../d/downside_deviation.md) is a measure of [downside risk](../d/downside_risk.md) and is calculated as follows:

1. Subtract the MAR from each periodic [return](../r/return.md) to determine the deviations.
2. Replace all positive deviations with zero, since the focus is on [downside risk](../d/downside_risk.md).
3. Square the negative deviations.
4. Sum these squared deviations.
5. Divide by the number of periods.
6. Take the square root of the result.

Mathematically:

\[
DD = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( \min(0, R_i - \text{MAR}) \right)^2}
\]

Where:
- \( R_i \) is the [return](../r/return.md) in period \( i \).
- \( \text{MAR} \) is the minimum acceptable [return](../r/return.md).
- \( n \) is the number of periods.

#### 5. Insert Variables into the Formula

Finally, use the calculated values of \( R \), \( R_f \), and \( DD \) in the [Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md) formula.

### Example Calculation

Consider the following example where an investment's annual returns over 5 years are: 10%, 5%, -2%, 12%, 8%. Assume the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate is 3%.

1. **Mean [Return](../r/return.md) (\( R \))**: 
\[ R = \frac{10 + 5 - 2 + 12 + 8}{5} = \frac{33}{5} = 6.6\% \]

2. **MAR**: Let's set MAR to the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate, \( R_f \) = 3%.

3. **Calculate Deviations**:
   - Year 1: 10% - 3% = 7% (positive, set to 0 for [downside deviation](../d/downside_deviation.md))
   - Year 2: 5% - 3% = 2% (positive, set to 0 for [downside deviation](../d/downside_deviation.md))
   - Year 3: -2% - 3% = -5% (negative, include in calculation)
   - Year 4: 12% - 3% = 9% (positive, set to 0 for [downside deviation](../d/downside_deviation.md))
   - Year 5: 8% - 3% = 5% (positive, set to 0 for [downside deviation](../d/downside_deviation.md))
   
   Negative deviations: 0, 0, -5%, 0, 0

4. **Square Negative Deviations**: 
   - \( (-5\%)^2 = 0.0025 \)
   
5. **Sum Squares and Calculate [Downside Deviation](../d/downside_deviation.md)**:
   - Sum: 0.0025
   - Divide by number of periods: \( \frac{0.0025}{5} = 0.0005 \)
   - Take the square root: \( \sqrt{0.0005} \approx 0.02236 \) or 2.236%

6. **[Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md)**:
\[ \text{[Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md)} = \frac{6.6\% - 3\%}{2.236\%} = \frac{3.6\%}{2.236\%} \approx 1.61 \]

### Interpretation

A higher [Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md) indicates a lower probability of [downside risk](../d/downside_risk.md) relative to the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md). Generally, a [Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md) above 1 is considered good, indicating that the investment's [return](../r/return.md) is high compared to its [downside risk](../d/downside_risk.md). A higher [Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md) also suggests that the investment is more efficient in generating returns per unit of [downside risk](../d/downside_risk.md). 

### Practical Considerations

#### Use Cases

1. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Investors and financial analysts use the [Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md) to understand better the [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted returns considering only the [downside risk](../d/downside_risk.md), which is especially critical for retirement funds, conservative portfolios, and [risk-averse](../r/risk-averse.md) investors.

2. **[Performance Benchmarking](../p/performance_benchmarking.md)**: Financial [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md) often compare the [Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md) of different investments, funds, or portfolios to [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) them against peers or [market](../m/market.md) averages.

#### Limitations

1. **Subjectivity in MAR**: The selection of the Minimum Acceptable [Return](../r/return.md) can significantly impact the ratio. Different investors may have different MARs, leading to inconsistent comparisons.
2. **Not Considering All Risks**: The [Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md) does not account for all kinds of risks, including macroeconomic risks, [market risk](../m/market_risk.md), and specific investment risks.
3. **Only Historical Data**: Like many financial metrics, the [Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md) relies on past performance, which may not necessarily predict future results.

### Tools for Calculation

Several online tools and financial software can help compute the [Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md) efficiently:

- **Portfolio Visualizer**: An online tool that provides detailed [portfolio analysis](../p/portfolio_analysis.md), including the [Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md) (https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/).
- **[Financial Planning](../f/financial_planning.md) Software**: Many platforms like **[Morningstar](../m/morningstar.md)**, **[Bloomberg](../b/bloomberg.md)**, and **Mint** [offer](../o/offer.md) [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md), including the [Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md) (https://www.[morningstar](../m/morningstar.md).com/, https://www.[bloomberg](../b/bloomberg.md).com/, https://www.mint.com/).

### Conclusion

The [Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md) is a valuable tool for investors seeking to evaluate the [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted returns of their investments while focusing specifically on [downside risk](../d/downside_risk.md). By filtering out the [upside](../u/upside.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md), it offers a clearer picture of how well an investment compensates for the [risk](../r/risk.md) of undesirable returns. Employing the [Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md) in conjunction with other financial metrics can lead to more informed and effective investment decisions.

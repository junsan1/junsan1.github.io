# Systematic Risk

Systematic [risk](../r/risk.md), also known as [market risk](../m/market_risk.md) or undiversifiable [risk](../r/risk.md), is the [inherent risk](../i/inherent_risk.md) associated with the entire [market](../m/market.md) or [market segment](../m/market_segment.md). Unlike [unsystematic risk](../u/unsystematic_risk.md), which affects a specific company or [industry](../i/industry.md), systematic [risk](../r/risk.md) impacts all investments across various sectors and cannot be mitigated through [diversification](../d/diversification.md) alone. Investors typically face systematic [risk](../r/risk.md) due to macroeconomic factors such as changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, [inflation](../i/inflation.md), [geopolitical events](../g/geopolitical_events.md), or recessions. This type of [risk](../r/risk.md) is fundamental to the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), and its management is crucial for maintaining portfolio stability and achieving long-term investment goals.

### Key Characteristics of Systematic Risk

1. **Broad Impact**: Systematic [risk](../r/risk.md) affects the overall [market](../m/market.md) rather than a single stock or [industry](../i/industry.md). For instance, a significant change in [inflation](../i/inflation.md) can impact the entire [economy](../e/economy.md).
2. **Non-diversifiable**: Unlike specific company risks, systematic [risk](../r/risk.md) cannot be avoided through [diversification](../d/diversification.md). It requires different [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) strategies.
3. **Macro Factors**: Systematic [risk](../r/risk.md) arises from large-scale economic events, such as changes in [fiscal policy](../f/fiscal_policy.md), political instability, or natural disasters.
4. **[Market Correlation](../m/market_correlation.md)**: Investments tend to move in tandem under systematic [risk](../r/risk.md) conditions. For example, during a [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md), most [asset](../a/asset.md) classes may exhibit correlated declines.

### Sources of Systematic Risk

Several macroeconomic factors can contribute to systematic [risk](../r/risk.md). These include:

1. **Economic Factors**: Elements such as GDP [growth rates](../g/growth_rates_in_trading.md), [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) figures, and consumer spending directly impact [market](../m/market.md) stability. Periods of economic [expansion](../e/expansion.md) typically reduce systematic [risk](../r/risk.md), while recessions increase it.
2. **[Interest Rate](../i/interest_rate.md) Changes**: Central banks, like the Federal Reserve in the United States, influence systematic [risk](../r/risk.md) by altering [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. A rise in rates can make borrowing more expensive, reducing corporate profits and slowing down [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md).
3. **[Inflation](../i/inflation.md)**: Rapid [inflation](../i/inflation.md) can erode [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) and reduce the real returns on investments. It generally leads to higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, further impacting [market](../m/market.md) conditions.
4. **Political Stability**: Political events and instability (e.g., elections, governmental changes, or international conflicts) can create [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md), affecting [market](../m/market.md) confidence and [investor](../i/investor.md) sentiment.
5. **Natural Disasters**: Events like earthquakes, hurricanes, or pandemics can disrupt economies, leading to significant systematic [risk](../r/risk.md). The COVID-19 pandemic is a prime example of a systemic shock that affected global [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

### Measuring Systematic Risk

To quantify systematic [risk](../r/risk.md), financial professionals often use metrics like [beta](../b/beta.md) and [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md):

1. **[Beta](../b/beta.md) (Î²)**: [Beta](../b/beta.md) measures a [security](../s/security.md)'s sensitivity to [market](../m/market.md) movements. A [beta](../b/beta.md) of 1 indicates that the [security](../s/security.md) moves with the [market](../m/market.md). A [beta](../b/beta.md) greater than 1 means the [security](../s/security.md) is more volatile than the [market](../m/market.md), while a [beta](../b/beta.md) less than 1 indicates lower [volatility](../v/volatility.md).
2. **[Standard Deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md)**: This statistical measure shows the [dispersion](../d/dispersion.md) of an [asset](../a/asset.md)'s returns relative to its mean. Higher [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) typically indicates higher systematic [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Mitigating Systematic Risk

Although it cannot be entirely eliminated, several strategies can be employed to manage systematic [risk](../r/risk.md):

1. **[Asset Allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md)**: Diversifying investments across various [asset](../a/asset.md) classes (e.g., [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), commodities) can help reduce exposure to systematic [risk](../r/risk.md).
2. **Hedging**: Using financial instruments such as [options](../o/options.md), [futures](../f/futures.md), or [swap](../s/swap.md) contracts to [offset](../o/offset.md) potential losses can help manage systematic [risk](../r/risk.md).
3. **[Global Diversification](../g/global_diversification.md)**: [Investing](../i/investing.md) in international markets can help mitigate the impact of country-specific systematic risks.
4. **Long-term View**: Adopting a long-term [investment horizon](../i/investment_horizon.md) can help weather short-term [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) associated with systematic [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Case Studies and Practical Applications

#### Financial Crisis of 2008

The 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) serves as a vivid example of systematic [risk](../r/risk.md). The collapse of [Lehman Brothers](../l/lehman_brothers.md) and the ensuing [liquidity crisis](../l/liquidity_crisis.md) triggered a global economic downturn, affecting all [asset](../a/asset.md) classes and industries. Investors worldwide experienced significant portfolio losses, demonstrating the pervasive nature of systematic [risk](../r/risk.md).

#### COVID-19 Pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic brought unparalleled systematic [risk](../r/risk.md) to [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). Lockdowns, [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md) disruptions, and shifts in consumer behavior led to sharp declines in stock prices globally. Governments and central banks implemented massive fiscal and monetary stimulus measures to stabilize markets and mitigate the pandemic's systemic impact.

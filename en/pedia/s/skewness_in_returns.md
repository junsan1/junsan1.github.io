# Skewness in Returns

[Skewness](../s/skewness.md) in returns is a statistical measure that describes the [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of returns for a [security](../s/security.md) or portfolio over a given period of time. It provides insight into the asymmetry of the [return](../r/return.md) [distribution](../d/distribution.md), indicating whether the returns are skewed towards more positive or negative outcomes. Understanding [skewness](../s/skewness.md) is crucial for algorithmic traders (commonly known as algo traders) because it influences [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), [hedging strategies](../h/hedging_strategies.md), and the overall portfolio allocation.

### Definition and Measurement

**[Skewness](../s/skewness.md)** can be mathematically defined as:

\[ \text{[Skewness](../s/skewness.md)} = \frac{\mathbb{E}\left[(R - \mu)^3\right]}{\sigma^3} \]

where:
- \( R \) is the [return](../r/return.md).
- \( \mu \) is the mean [return](../r/return.md).
- \( \sigma \) is the [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) of returns.
- \(\mathbb{E}\) denotes the [expected value](../e/expected_value.md).

### Types of Skewness

1. **[Positive Skewness](../p/positive_skewness.md) (Right-skewed)**:
   - A [distribution](../d/distribution.md) with [positive skewness](../p/positive_skewness.md) has a long right tail. This indicates that a greater proportion of the returns are higher, or more extreme positive returns.
   - [Positive skewness](../p/positive_skewness.md) means that the mean is greater than the [median](../m/median.md), which is greater than the [mode](../m/mode.md).

2. **[Negative Skewness](../n/negative_skewness.md) (Left-skewed)**:
   - A [distribution](../d/distribution.md) with [negative skewness](../n/negative_skewness.md) has a long left tail. This indicates that a greater proportion of the returns are lower, or more extreme negative returns.
   - [Negative skewness](../n/negative_skewness.md) means that the mean is less than the [median](../m/median.md), which is less than the [mode](../m/mode.md).

### Importance in Algo Trading

#### Risk Management

For algorithmic traders, understanding [skewness](../s/skewness.md) is essential in the context of [risk management](../r/risk_management.md). Positive skewed returns might indicate that larger-than-average returns are likely, but they come less frequently. Conversely, negative skewed returns may indicate a higher frequency of smaller returns, but with the potential for these small returns to compound into larger losses.

#### Portfolio Allocation

[Skewness](../s/skewness.md) can influence the allocation of assets within a portfolio. Algo traders might prefer assets with specific [skewness](../s/skewness.md) characteristics to achieve a desired [risk](../r/risk.md)-[return](../r/return.md) profile. For instance, they may look for assets with [positive skewness](../p/positive_skewness.md) to potentially benefit from large positive returns.

#### Performance Metrics

Traditional [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md) like the [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) do not account for [skewness](../s/skewness.md). Therefore, algo traders often supplement these metrics with [skewness](../s/skewness.md) to get a clearer picture of the potential risks and returns of their strategies.

### Example in Practice

#### QuantConnectâ€™s Algorithm Module

[QuantConnect](../q/quantconnect.md) is an [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) platform that provides tools for [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) and deploying [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). One of its [algorithm modules](https://www.quantconnect.com) can be used to assess the [skewness](../s/skewness.md) of a [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md)'s returns, enabling traders to refine their models based on the [skewness](../s/skewness.md) parameter.

### Mathematical Context

[Skewness](../s/skewness.md) is a higher-[order](../o/order.md) moment, similar to variance (second-[order](../o/order.md) moment), and it involves more complex computations. Although it provides additional insights into the [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of returns, it needs to be interpreted cautiously as it can be affected by extreme values outliers.

### Statistical Tools and Libraries

#### Python Libraries

Many algo traders use Python for statistical analysis. Libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and SciPy [offer](../o/offer.md) built-in functions to calculate [skewness](../s/skewness.md). Here's an example using these libraries:

```python
[import](../i/import.md) numpy as np
[import](../i/import.md) pandas as pd
from scipy.stats [import](../i/import.md) skew

# Generating a sample of returns
returns = np.random.randn(1000)

# Calculating skewness
skewness_value = skew(returns)
print(f"[Skewness](../s/skewness.md): {skewness_value}")
```

### Real-world Applications

**[Hedge](../h/hedge.md) Funds and Quantitative Investment Firms**

[Hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds and investment firms such as Renaissance Technologies and Bridgewater Associates use [skewness](../s/skewness.md) in their [quantitative models](../q/quantitative_models.md) to optimize their [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) and manage [risk](../r/risk.md) more effectively. [Skewness](../s/skewness.md) analysis helps these firms understand the properties of [asset](../a/asset.md) returns beyond mean and variance, providing a more comprehensive view of potential portfolio outcomes.

### Conclusion

[Skewness](../s/skewness.md) is a vital statistical measure that goes beyond simple mean and variance in describing the [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of returns. For algorithmic traders, understanding and utilizing [skewness](../s/skewness.md) helps in [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), refining [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md), and making more informed portfolio allocation decisions. As algo trading continues to evolve, leveraging statistical measures like [skewness](../s/skewness.md) [will](../w/will.md) remain a cornerstone in the development and [optimization](../o/optimization.md) of sophisticated [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

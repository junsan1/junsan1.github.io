# Sharpe Ratio Calculation

The [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md), named after Nobel laureate William F. Sharpe, is a measure that helps investors and portfolio managers understand the return of an investment compared to its risk. It serves to analyze the [risk-adjusted return](../r/risk-adjusted_return.md) or to benchmark the performance of different asset classes or investment strategies.

## Definition

Mathematically, the [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) is defined as:

\[ \text{[Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md)} = \frac{E[R_p - R_f]}{\sigma_p} \]

Where:
- \( E[R_p - R_f] \) is the expected excess return of the portfolio over the risk-free rate.
- \( \sigma_p \) is the standard deviation of the portfolio's excess return, which measures the investment's volatility or risk.

## Components of the Sharpe Ratio

### Expected Portfolio Return (\(E[R_p]\))

The expected return of the portfolio (\(E[R_p]\)) represents the average return the portfolio is anticipated to generate over a specific period.

### Risk-Free Rate (\(R_f\))

The risk-free rate (\(R_f\)) is often proxied by the return on short-term government securities, such as U.S. Treasury bills. It represents the return expected from an investment with zero risk, serving as a baseline for measuring risk-adjusted performance.

### Excess Return (\( E[R_p - R_f] \))

The excess return is the difference between the expected portfolio return and the risk-free rate. It represents additional returns generated over an investment period after accounting for the risk-free rate.

### Standard Deviation of Portfolio's Excess Return (\( \sigma_p \))

The standard deviation of a portfolio’s excess return (\( \sigma_p \)) quantifies the volatility of the returns. A higher standard deviation indicates greater risk as the returns fluctuate widely from the mean return.

## Steps to Calculate the Sharpe Ratio

### 1. Calculate the Average Periodic Return

Determine the average return of the portfolio over a set period. For instance, if calculating monthly returns over a year, sum the monthly returns and divide by 12.

\[ \text{Average Return} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} R_{p,i} \]

Where:
- \( N \) is the number of periods.
- \( R_{p,i} \) is the return of the portfolio in period \( i \).

### 2. Determine the Risk-Free Rate

Identify the risk-free rate applicable to the period of investment. If using monthly data, ensure the risk-free rate is also expressed on a monthly basis.

### 3. Compute the Excess Return per Period

Subtract the risk-free rate from the periodic returns to calculate the excess return for each period.

\[ \text{Excess Return}_{i} = R_{p,i} - R_f \]

### 4. Compute the Average Excess Return

Calculate the average excess return over all periods.

\[ \text{Average Excess Return} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (R_{p,i} - R_f) \]

### 5. Calculate the Standard Deviation of Excess Returns

Determine the standard deviation of the excess returns across the periods.

\[ \sigma_p = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} [(R_{p,i} - R_f) - \text{Average Excess Return}]^2}{N - 1}} \]

### 6. Compute the Sharpe Ratio

Divide the average excess return by the standard deviation of excess returns.

\[ \text{[Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md)} = \frac{\text{Average Excess Return}}{\sigma_p} \]

## Practical Application Example

### Portfolio X Analysis
- Suppose Portfolio X has monthly returns for one year as follows: 1.2%, 0.8%, 1.5%, -0.5%, etc.
- The risk-free rate (annualized) is 2%, which translates to a monthly rate of approximately 0.1667%.

First, calculate the average monthly return of Portfolio X. Assume the summation of these returns divided by 12 yields an average return of 0.9%.

Next, compute the excess return by subtracting the risk-free rate from each monthly return. For example:
- January: 1.2% - 0.1667% = 1.0333%
- February: 0.8% - 0.1667% = 0.6333%
- Continue for each month.

Calculate the average excess return from these values, let’s assume it’s 0.7333%, and then determine the standard deviation for these excess returns. Suppose the standard deviation comes out to 0.6%.

Finally, compute the [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md):

\[ \text{[Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md)} = \frac{0.7333\%}{0.6\%} = 1.222 \]

A [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) of 1.222 indicates that Portfolio X provides 1.222 units of extra return per unit of risk, suggesting that the portfolio manager is generating excellent returns for the assumed level of risk.

## Sharpe Ratio in Algorithmic Trading

In [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), system inefficiencies are captured by algorithms that execute trades to capitalize on slight price differences. Effective algorithms should aim for a high [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) by achieving significant returns with minimal risk. This is often done using techniques such as:
- **[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md):** Calculating Sharpe Ratios on historical data to gauge expected performance.
- **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md):** Adjusting position sizes, stop losses, and other risk parameters to minimize portfolio volatility.

## Limitations of Sharpe Ratio

### Assumption of Normally Distributed Returns

The calculation presumes [normal distribution](../n/normal_distribution_in_trading.md) of returns, which isn’t always true. Asymmetrical return distributions affect the reliability of the [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md).

### Risk-Free Rate Consistency

Choosing an appropriate risk-free rate is critical. Mismatches between the investment horizon and the risk-free instrument’s maturity can distort the [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) measurement.

### Time Variation

The [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) might not be consistent over different periods. A strategy yielding a high [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) in a bull market may falter in a bear market or vice versa.

# Series 63

The Series 63, also known as the Uniform Securities Agent State Law Examination, is a securities license required by most states in the United States for individuals who want to sell securities. The license is administered by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and is designed to ensure that securities professionals have a strong understanding of state-level regulations and laws governing securities transactions.

The Series 63 exam was created by the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) and was first implemented in 1979. This exam is one of several that securities professionals might need to take, depending on the scope of their responsibilities and the products they intend to sell. Typically, it’s taken in conjunction with other exams such as the Series 6, Series 7, or Series 79.

## Exam Structure

The Series 63 exam consists of 60 multiple-choice questions, out of which 43 questions must be answered correctly to pass. The time allotted for the exam is 75 minutes. The key topics covered in the exam include:

1. State Securities Acts and Regulations
2. Ethical Practices and Fiduciary Obligations
3. Remedies and Administrative Provisions
4. Business Practices
5. Registration of Persons and Securities

## Preparation and Study Materials

Preparing for the Series 63 exam generally requires substantial study, often involving multiple resources such as textbooks, online courses, and practice exams. Most candidates recommend at least 40-50 hours of dedicated study time, focusing on understanding both the conceptual and practical aspects of state securities regulations.

Key study materials often include:
- NASAA's "Uniform Securities Act"
- Online courses and webinars offered by educational providers
- Exam prep books and practice exams from providers like Kaplan Financial Education, ExamFX, and Pass Perfect
- NASAA's own study guide and content outline

## Registration Process

To register for the Series 63 exam, candidates need to follow these steps:
1. **Firm Sponsorship**: Most brokerage firms or investment advisory firms must sponsor the candidates.
2. **Form U4**: The firm will file a Form U4 (Uniform Application for Securities Industry Registration or Transfer) with FINRA.
3. **Scheduling**: Once the form is approved, candidates can schedule their exam through Prometric, a testing service provider.
4. **Fees**: The fee for taking the Series 63 exam is $135, though it might be subject to change.

## After the Exam

Upon passing the Series 63 exam, candidates are authorized to transact securities within the states that require this certification. However, merely passing the Series 63 does not permit one to sell securities; one must also pass other exams relevant to the specific securities or investment products they plan to sell.

### Continuing Education

Maintaining the Series 63 license may not directly require continued education credits as some other licenses do, but securities professionals are subject to their firm’s policies and the overarching regulatory requirements ensuring they stay informed about changes in the laws and practices.

## Integration with Other Licenses

The Series 63 is often considered a complementary license. For example:
- **Series 6**: Limited to mutual funds, variable annuities, and insurance products.
- **Series 7**: General securities representative license allows the sale of a broader range of investment products.
- **Series 79**: For investment bankers dealing with M&A and other advisory roles.

Professionals often hold multiple licenses depending on their roles, necessitating a good understanding of various overlapping regulations and compliance requirements.

# Sentiment Indicators

In financial markets, [sentiment indicators](../s/sentiment_indicators.md) are tools that investors and traders use to gauge the overall mood or sentiment of the market, which can offer insights into potential future market movements. These sentiments may pertain to a wide variety of market participants including retail traders, institutional investors, analysts, and even media outlets. Here, we will delve into the concept of [sentiment indicators](../s/sentiment_indicators.md), types, how they are used in trading, and some popular [sentiment indicators](../s/sentiment_indicators.md) available today.

## What are Sentiment Indicators?

[Sentiment indicators](../s/sentiment_indicators.md) are metrics that are designed to gauge the sentiment or attitude of market participants regarding a particular security, sector, or the market as a whole. They can be quantitative or qualitative, and they capture whether the market's attitude is predominantly bullish, bearish, or neutral. These indicators are particularly valuable because markets are driven not solely by fundamentals but also by human emotions and psychological factors.

[Sentiment indicators](../s/sentiment_indicators.md) are often used in conjunction with other forms of analysis, such as [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) and [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md), to get a more complete picture of market conditions.

## Types of Sentiment Indicators

### Bullish and Bearish Sentiment Indicators

1. **Bullish [Sentiment Indicators](../s/sentiment_indicators.md):** These suggest that the market participants are optimistic about the future performance of a security or the market. High levels of bullish sentiment can be a precursor to rising prices.
2. **Bearish [Sentiment Indicators](../s/sentiment_indicators.md):** These suggest that market participants are pessimistic about the future performance of a security or the market. High levels of bearish sentiment can precede falling prices.

### Market Breadth Indicators

[Market breadth indicators](../m/market_breadth_indicators.md) measure the degree of participation in the market's movements. If a large number of stocks are advancing, the market is considered to have strong breadth.

### Commitment of Traders (COT) Report

1. **COT Report:** Published by the [Commodity Futures](../c/commodity_futures.md) Trading Commission (CFTC), the Commitment of Traders report offers a breakdown of the positions held by commercial and non-commercial traders in the futures market. It is used to gauge the sentiment of large institutional traders versus smaller individual traders.

### Put/Call Ratio

1. **Put/Call Ratio:** This ratio compares the volume of [put options](../p/put_options.md) to call options. A high put/call ratio can be a sign of bearish sentiment, while a low ratio can indicate bullish sentiment.

### Volatility Index (VIX)

1. **VIX:** Known as the "fear gauge," the Volatility Index measures market volatility and is often inversely correlated with the market's performance.

### Social Media Sentiment

1. **[Social Media Sentiment](../s/social_media_sentiment.md):** Using [artificial intelligence](../a/artificial_intelligence_in_trading.md) and [natural language processing](../n/natural_language_processing_(nlp)_in_trading.md), some platforms analyze social media chatter to gauge market sentiment. For example, monitoring tweets or discussions on forums related to specific stocks.

### Investor Surveys

1. **Investor Surveys:** Organizations like the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) conduct weekly surveys to measure the sentiment of retail investors.

## How Sentiment Indicators Are Used in Trading

### Contrarian Strategy

One common approach is to use [sentiment indicators](../s/sentiment_indicators.md) as contrarian tools, especially when sentiment reaches extreme levels. The idea is to go against the popular sentiment when it becomes overwhelmingly bullish or bearish, under the assumption that the market may be overextended and due for a reversal.

### Confirmation Tools

[Sentiment indicators](../s/sentiment_indicators.md) can be used to confirm trends identified through technical or [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md). For example, if [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) suggests a bullish trend and [sentiment indicators](../s/sentiment_indicators.md) concur, the trader may have more confidence in initiating a long position.

### Hedging

Some traders use [sentiment indicators](../s/sentiment_indicators.md) to hedge their positions. For instance, if [sentiment indicators](../s/sentiment_indicators.md) suggest an upcoming spike in volatility, traders might buy VIX futures or options to protect their portfolios.

### Market Timing

[Sentiment indicators](../s/sentiment_indicators.md) can help traders decide the optimal time to enter or exit the market. For example, extreme bullish sentiment in a declining market might suggest it's time to reenter after a pullback.

## Examples of Popular Sentiment Indicators

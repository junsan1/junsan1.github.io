# S&P 500 Index (Standard & Poor's 500 Index)

The S&P 500 [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (Standard & Poor's 500 [Index](../i/index_instrument.md)) is one of the most frequently used benchmarks for the overall performance of the U.S. [stock market](../s/stock_market.md). This choice of [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) is due to its broad representation of the [market](../m/market.md), given that it includes 500 of the largest companies [listed](../l/listed.md) on stock exchanges in the United States. It is considered to capture approximately 80% of the available [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md).

## Historical Background

### Formation and Evolution
The S&P 500 [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) was introduced in 1957 by Standard & Poor's, which later became a division of McGraw-Hill. Over the years, what began as a simple stock [market index](../m/market_index.md) evolved into a cornerstone for [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) globally.

### Important Milestones
The S&P 500 has undergone several changes to keep pace with the evolving [market](../m/market.md). Noteworthy milestones include:
- **1982:** Introduction of S&P 500 [futures](../f/futures.md) by the Chicago Mercantile [Exchange](../e/exchange.md).
- **1993:** Introduction of SPDR S&P 500 ETF [Trust](../t/trust.md) (SPY), the first [exchange](../e/exchange.md)-traded [fund](../f/fund.md) (ETF) to track the S&P 500 [index](../i/index_instrument.md).
- **2000s:** Inclusion of tech giants such as Google (Alphabet), Facebook, and others.

## Constituent Criteria

To be included in the S&P 500 [Index](../i/index_instrument.md), a company must meet several criteria. These criteria ensure that the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) remains representative of the broad U.S. [economy](../e/economy.md).

### Market Capitalization
A company's [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) must be at least $8.2 billion as of 2021. The number is periodically adjusted for [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

### Financial Viability
Companies must demonstrate financial viability, typically shown by four consecutive quarters of positive as-reported [earnings](../e/earnings.md) (generally accepted [accounting principles](../a/accounting_principles.md), GAAP, net [income](../i/income.md)).

### Liquidity and Float
A company’s [shares](../s/shares.md) must be highly [liquid](../l/liquid.md). This is generally assessed by examining trading [volume](../v/volume.md). Additionally, at least 50% of a company's [shares](../s/shares.md) must be available to the public (public [float](../f/float.md)).

### Domicile and Sector
The company must be domiciled in the United States. The [index](../i/index_instrument.md) aims for balanced representation across sectors, aligning with the Global [Industry](../i/industry.md) Classification Standard (GICS).

### Corporate Governance
Sound [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) and being [listed](../l/listed.md) on a recognized U.S. stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md) are also crucial factors.

## Index Calculation and Maintenance

### Calculation Method
The S&P 500 is a [market](../m/market.md)-[capitalization](../c/capitalization.md)-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md), meaning companies are [weighted](../w/weighted.md) according to their total [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md). The [index](../i/index_instrument.md) [value](../v/value.md) is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{[Index](../i/index_instrument.md) [Value](../v/value.md)} = \left( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left( P_i \times Q_i \right)}{ \text{Divisor} } \right) \]

Where:
- \( P_i \) is the price of stock \( i \).
- \( Q_i \) is the adjusted [float](../f/float.md) of stock \( i \).
- The ``Divisor" is an adjustment [factor](../f/factor.md) tuned to keep the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) [value](../v/value.md) consistent despite changes like stock splits.

### Rebalancing and Updates
The [index](../i/index_instrument.md) is reviewed quarterly. Adjustments may occur due to corporate actions like mergers, acquisitions, and bankruptcies. Constituents are also replaced if a company's [market](../m/market.md) cap or [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) falls below the required thresholds.

## Role in Financial Markets

### Benchmark for Funds and Managers
The S&P 500 serves as a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for a multitude of investment funds, including mutual funds and ETFs. [Fund](../f/fund.md) managers often compare their performance to the S&P 500, given its broad representation.

### Financial Derivatives
[Futures](../f/futures.md), [options](../o/options.md), and other [financial derivatives](../f/financial_derivatives.md) tied to the S&P 500 are heavily used in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) or speculate. Prominent [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) include S&P 500 [futures](../f/futures.md) and [index options](../i/index_options.md).

### Economic Indicator
Given its diversified composition, the S&P 500 is a reliable [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of general [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md). Rising or falling trends in the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) often reflect broader economic performance.

## Investment Strategies

### Passive and Active Investing
The S&P 500 [index](../i/index_instrument.md) has fostered various investment strategies:
- **[Passive Investing](../p/passive_investing.md):** Defined by funds that simply replicate the [index](../i/index_instrument.md). This gives investors broad [market exposure](../m/market_exposure.md) at a low cost.
- **[Active Management](../a/active_management.md):** Some managers attempt to [outperform](../o/outperform.md) the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) by selectively picking [stocks](../s/stock.md) they believe [will](../w/will.md) [outperform](../o/outperform.md).

### ETFs and Mutual Funds
[Multiple](../m/multiple.md) ETFs and mutual funds are designed to replicate or beat the S&P 500. The most famous is the SPDR S&P 500 ETF [Trust](../t/trust.md) (SPY), which is one of the largest and most [liquid](../l/liquid.md) ETFs.

## Technological Integration

### Algorithmic Trading
The S&P 500's predictable composition and regular updates make it a favorite for [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md). Algorithms may exploit small discrepancies in prices between constituent [stocks](../s/stock.md) and the [index](../i/index_instrument.md)’s [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md).

### FinTech Applications
FinTech platforms use the S&P 500 as a reference in robo-advising, [portfolio management](../p/par.md), and even fractional [investing](../i/investing.md), where users can buy portions of an S&P 500 ETF share.

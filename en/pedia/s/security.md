# Security

In the financial world, a security refers to a [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) that holds some type of monetary [value](../v/value.md). It represents an ownership position in a publicly-traded [corporation](../c/corporation.md) (stock), a [creditor](../c/creditor.md) relationship with a governmental body or a [corporation](../c/corporation.md) ([bond](../b/bond.md)), or rights to ownership as represented by an option. Securities are broadly categorized into two types: equities and debts.

## Types of Securities

### Equities

Equities, or [stocks](../s/stock.md), represent ownership in a company and constitute a claim on part of the companyâ€™s assets and [earnings](../e/earnings.md). There are two main types of [stocks](../s/stock.md): common and preferred. Common [stocks](../s/stock.md) provide voting rights but may [offer](../o/offer.md) variable dividends, while preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) typically [offer](../o/offer.md) fixed dividends without voting rights. 

1. **[Common Stock](../c/common_stock.md) (Equities)**
    - Represents partial ownership in a company.
    - Includes voting rights on corporate matters.
    - Dividends are variable and not guaranteed.
    - Higher potential for [capital](../c/capital.md) appreciation and [risk](../r/risk.md).

2. **[Preferred Stock](../p/preferred_stock.md)**
    - Provides ownership in a company but usually without voting rights.
    - Dividends are fixed and more reliable than [common stock](../c/common_stock.md) dividends.
    - Higher claim on assets than [common stock](../c/common_stock.md) in the event of [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md).
    - Generally less volatile than [common stock](../c/common_stock.md).

### Debt Securities

[Debt](../d/debt.md) securities are essentially loans made by investors to the company or entity that issues the [debt](../d/debt.md). Bonds are the most common type of [debt security](../d/debt_security.md), and these come in several forms including corporate bonds, [municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md), and treasury bonds.

1. **Corporate Bonds**
    - [Debt](../d/debt.md) issued by companies.
    - [Offer](../o/offer.md) higher returns than government bonds but come with higher [risk](../r/risk.md).
    - May be either investment-grade or junk bonds.

2. **[Municipal Bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md)**
    - Issued by local and state governments.
    - Often [offer](../o/offer.md) [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) [income](../i/income.md).
    - Typically considered low-[risk](../r/risk.md).

3. **Treasury Bonds**
    - Issued by the federal government.
    - Considered one of the safest investments.
    - Fixed [interest](../i/interest.md) payments over a long term, usually more than 10 years.

### Hybrid Securities

Hybrid securities have characteristics of both [debt](../d/debt.md) and [equity](../e/equity.md). They can be converted into [common stock](../c/common_stock.md) or another type of security once specific conditions are met.

1. **Convertible Bonds**
    - Can be converted into a specific number of [shares](../s/shares.md) of the issuing company.
    - [Offer](../o/offer.md) lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates in [exchange](../e/exchange.md) for the potential of conversion to [equity](../e/equity.md).

2. **Preferred Convertible [Stocks](../s/stock.md)**
    - Preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) that holders can convert into a predetermined number of common [shares](../s/shares.md) under certain conditions.
    
### Derivative Securities

[Derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) are financial contracts whose [value](../v/value.md) is derived from an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), such as [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, commodities, currencies, [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, and [market](../m/market.md) indexes. These can be used for hedging or speculative purposes.

1. **[Options](../o/options.md)**
    - Contracts that give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a security at a specified price within a certain timeframe.
    
2. **[Futures](../f/futures.md)**
    - Contracts obligating the buyer to purchase, or the seller to sell, an [asset](../a/asset.md) at a predetermined future date and price.

3. **Swaps**
    - Contracts in which two parties agree to [exchange](../e/exchange.md) streams of payments over time (e.g., [interest rate swaps](../i/interest_rate_swaps.md), [currency](../c/currency.md) swaps).

## Regulatory Environment 

The [trade](../t/trade.md) and issuance of securities are strictly regulated. In the United States, the primary regulatory body overseeing securities is the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC). Globally, different countries have their respective regulatory bodies, such as the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the United Kingdom and the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) Board of India (SEBI).

### Key Regulations
1. **[Securities Act of 1933](../s/securities_act_of_1933.md)**
    - Enacted to regulate the [offer](../o/offer.md) and [sale](../s/sale.md) of securities.
    - Requires companies to provide financial and other significant information to investors.

2. **[Securities Exchange Act of 1934](../s/securities_exchange_act_of_1934.md)**
    - Created the SEC.
    - Governs the trading markets and brokerage firms.

3. **[Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002](../s/sarbanes-oxley_(sox)_act_of_2002.md)**
    - Introduced major changes to the regulation of financial practice and [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md).
    - Mandates strict reforms to improve financial disclosures and prevent [accounting](../a/accounting.md) [fraud](../f/fraud.md).

## Algo Trading and Fintech

In modern [finance](../f/finance.md), technologies like [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) and FinTech are increasingly pivotal. [Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) uses algorithms to automate [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) based on various [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md) and statistical analyses.

1. **[Algorithmic Trading](../a/accountability.md)**
    - Uses pre-programmed trading instructions based on criteria such as timing, price, and [volume](../v/volume.md).
    - Can execute trades at speeds and frequencies not possible for human traders.

2. **FinTech**
    - Refers to technology aiming to enhance or automate financial services.
    - Encompasses algorithms for trading, robo-advisors, [artificial intelligence](../a/artificial_intelligence_in_trading.md) in financial analytics, and [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology.

The regulatory framework ensures [transparency](../t/transparency.md), fairness, and protection for investors. With advancements in technology, particularly in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) and FinTech, the landscape of securities trading continues to evolve, [offering](../o/offering.md) both challenges and opportunities.

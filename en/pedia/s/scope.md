# Scope

## Definition
In trading, "scope" typically refers to the range or extent of price movement of a financial instrument within a specific time frame. It's often used in technical analysis to gauge volatility and potential trading opportunities.

## Key Aspects

### 1. Price Range
- Measures the difference between the highest and lowest prices of an asset over a given period
- Often expressed in points, pips, or percentage

### 2. Time Frame
- Can be applied to various time periods (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly)
- Helps traders identify short-term and long-term trends

### 3. Volatility Indicator
- Large scope indicates high volatility
- Small scope suggests low volatility or consolidation

## Applications in Trading

### 1. Support and Resistance Levels
- Helps identify potential price levels where buying or selling pressure may increase
- Used to set entry and exit points for trades

### 2. Breakout Trading
- Traders watch for prices moving beyond the recent scope as potential breakout signals
- Can indicate the start of new trends

### 3. Risk Management
- Assists in setting stop-loss orders based on typical price movements
- Helps in calculating position sizes relative to potential price swings

### 4. Volatility-based Strategies
- Some traders focus on high-scope (volatile) periods for short-term trading
- Others prefer low-scope periods for range-bound trading strategies

# Scope

## Definition
In trading, "scope" typically refers to the [range](../r/range.md) or extent of price movement of a [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) within a specific time frame. It's often used in [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) to gauge [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and potential trading opportunities.

## Key Aspects

### 1. Price Range
- Measures the difference between the highest and lowest prices of an [asset](../a/asset.md) over a given period
- Often expressed in points, pips, or percentage

### 2. Time Frame
- Can be applied to various time periods (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly)
- Helps traders identify short-term and long-term trends

### 3. Volatility Indicator
- Large scope indicates high [volatility](../v/volatility.md)
- Small scope suggests low [volatility](../v/volatility.md) or [consolidation](../c/consolidation.md)

## Applications in Trading

### 1. Support and Resistance Levels
- Helps identify potential price levels where buying or selling pressure may increase
- Used to set entry and exit points for trades

### 2. Breakout Trading
- Traders watch for prices moving beyond the recent scope as potential [breakout](../b/breakout.md) signals
- Can indicate the start of new trends

### 3. Risk Management
- Assists in setting [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md) based on typical price movements
- Helps in calculating position sizes relative to potential price swings

### 4. Volatility-based Strategies
- Some traders focus on high-scope (volatile) periods for [short-term trading](../s/short-term_trading.md)
- Others prefer low-scope periods for [range](../r/range.md)-bound [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md)

## Related Concepts

1. **[Average True Range](../a/average_true_range_(atr).md) (ATR)**
   - A technical [indicator](../i/indicator.md) that measures [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md)
   - Often used alongside scope analysis for a more comprehensive view

2. **Trading [Range](../r/range.md)**
   - Similar to scope but typically refers to longer-term price boundaries

3. **[Price Action](../p/price_action.md)**
   - The study of an [asset](../a/asset.md)'s price movement over time
   - Scope is one aspect of [price action analysis](../p/price_action_analysis.md)

## Importance in Trading Decisions

- Helps traders assess potential [profit](../p/profit.md) targets
- Aids in determining appropriate [leverage](../l/leverage.md) and [position sizing](../p/position_sizing.md)
- Contributes to overall [market](../m/market.md) analysis and strategy development

## Limitations

- Past scope doesn't guarantee future price movements
- Should be used in conjunction with other technical and [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md) tools
- May be less reliable during periods of extreme [market](../m/market.md) conditions or news events

# Series 57

The Series 57 — also known as the Securities [Trader](../t/trader.md) Qualification Examination (STQE) — is a securities license and exam required for individuals who wish to engage in trading in the U.S. securities markets. It is administered by the Financial [Industry](../i/industry.md) Regulatory Authority (FINRA). The exam is designed to assess a candidate's knowledge and competence in the field of securities trading. This guide [will](../w/will.md) delve into the specifics of the Series 57 license, the content and structure of the examination, the eligibility criteria, and the significance of the license in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

## What is Series 57?

Series 57 is a license that primarily pertains to [equity](../e/equity.md) traders and proprietary traders. It allows individuals to [trade](../t/trade.md) [equity](../e/equity.md) and convertible [debt](../d/debt.md) securities in the [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md). It's essential for those working for [broker](../b/broker.md)-dealers, [proprietary trading](../p/proprietary_trading.md) firms, and other financial institutions where managing and executing trades is a core function.

Holding a Series 57 license is a regulatory requirement as it ensures that traders have the necessary knowledge of [market](../m/market.md) regulations, [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices, and compliance standards. This license replaced the now-defunct Series 55 license after a regulatory overhaul aimed at modernizing and consolidating various FINRA exams.

## Exam Content and Structure

The Series 57 exam consists of 50 [multiple](../m/multiple.md)-choice questions that cover a broad [range](../r/range.md) of topics related to securities trading. Candidates are given 105 minutes to complete the test. The exam includes questions on various subjects, including but not limited to:

- **[Market](../m/market.md) Participants and [Market](../m/market.md) Structure**: This section covers the different [market](../m/market.md) participants, their roles, and the structure of the [equity](../e/equity.md) markets.
- **Types of Orders and Trading Practices**: Candidates need to understand the different types of orders (like limit orders, [market](../m/market.md) orders, stop orders) and the trading practices commonly employed in the [industry](../i/industry.md).
- **Regulatory Requirements for Traders**: Knowing the SEC and FINRA rules and regulations that govern trading activities.
- **[Proprietary Trading](../p/proprietary_trading.md)**: Focuses on strategies used in [proprietary trading](../p/proprietary_trading.md) desks and the [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices associated with these [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

Each question tests the candidate’s ability to apply the rules and practices in realistic scenarios that they might encounter in their trading practice.

## Eligibility Criteria

To be eligible to sit for the Series 57 exam, a candidate must be associated with and sponsored by a FINRA-member [firm](../f/firm.md) or another regulatory authority's [firm](../f/firm.md). This sponsorship requirement means that candidates already need to be employed in the [industry](../i/industry.md) and be preparing for or expanding their roles within their [firm](../f/firm.md).

Furthermore, candidates are required to pass the Securities [Industry](../i/industry.md) Essentials (SIE) exam either before or along with the Series 57 exam. The SIE exam tests fundamental securities [industry](../i/industry.md) knowledge and serves as a stepping stone to more specialized FINRA exams like the Series 57. 

## The Significance of the Series 57 License

### Compliance and Regulation

Holding a Series 57 license signifies that the [trader](../t/trader.md) has met the necessary regulatory standards required for trading securities. Regulatory compliance is a significant focus in today’s [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), and the Series 57 ensures the [trader](../t/trader.md) is well-versed in the rules and practices required to [trade](../t/trade.md) securities lawfully and ethically.

### Knowledge and Expertise

Achieving the Series 57 certification demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of [market](../m/market.md) mechanics, [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), and regulatory requirements. This is critical not only for ensuring effective and compliant trading operations but also for maintaining the integrity and stability of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

### Career Advancement

For professionals in the trading [industry](../i/industry.md), obtaining the Series 57 license can be crucial for career advancement.

The Series 57 ensures that professionals are equipped to [handle](../h/handle.md) these complex aspects efficiently and ethically, thus contributing to the robustness and integrity of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

## The Examination Process

### Registration and Application

The registration can be completed using the Form U4 (Uniform Application for Securities [Industry](../i/industry.md) Registration or Transfer). Once registered, candidates can schedule their examination through the Prometric website, which administers the test on behalf of FINRA.

### Fees

### Retaking the Exam

If a candidate does not pass the Series 57 exam on their first attempt, they must wait 30 days before taking it again. After a third failed attempt, a [waiting period](../w/waiting_period.md) of 180 days is imposed before the candidate can retake the exam.

## Continuing Education and Maintaining the License

Once a candidate has passed the Series 57 exam and obtained their license, maintaining the license involves ongoing regulatory education. FINRA requires registered representatives to complete a continuing education program, comprising both [firm](../f/firm.md)-element and regulatory-element training.

### Firm-Element Training

[Firm](../f/firm.md)-element training is designed and administered by the employing [firm](../f/firm.md) and includes annual training programs that address product-specific knowledge, compliance issues, and other pertinent topics relevant to the [trader](../t/trader.md)’s role and responsibilities.

### Regulatory-Element Training

The regulatory-element training is mandated by FINRA and must be completed within 120 days of a registered representative’s second anniversary date of obtaining their license, and every three years thereafter. This training module typically includes a review of current regulatory updates, compliance mandates, and [market](../m/market.md) trends.

## Conclusion

# Schedule 13D

A Schedule 13D is a form that must be filed with the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) when an individual or group acquires more than 5% of a company's [equity](../e/equity.md) securities. This filing provides important information to the public, especially other shareholders and potential investors, about who holds significant stakes in a company and their intentions regarding that investment. This document, also known as the "beneficial ownership report," is crucial for ensuring [transparency](../t/transparency.md) in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

## What Is Schedule 13D?

### Definition

Schedule 13D is a regulatory filing mandated by the US Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC). The form is required under Section 13(d) of the [Securities Exchange Act of 1934](../s/securities_exchange_act_of_1934.md). When a person or group surpasses the 5% ownership threshold in a publicly traded company, they must submit this form within ten days of the [transaction](../t/transaction.md). 

### Purpose

Schedule 13D is intended to inform the [investing](../i/investing.md) public about the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md). Key details in the filing include:

- The identity of the acquirer
- The source and amount of funds used for the purchase
- The purpose of the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) (e.g., whether the acquirer plans to influence management or make changes to the company's strategy)

The form also discloses any transactions in the company's [shares](../s/shares.md) in the 60 days prior to the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md).

## How to File Schedule 13D

### Filing Process

Filing a Schedule 13D can be broken down into several steps:

1. **Acquire Necessary Information:** Gather details about the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md), including the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) purchased, the percentage of ownership, and the identities of the buyers.

2. **Complete the Form:** The Schedule 13D form must be completed accurately, including all requested information. Failure to provide complete and accurate data can result in legal consequences.

3. **Submit the Form Electronically:** Filings must be submitted electronically via the SEC’s EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval) system. The filer must first register with EDGAR if they have not done so previously.

### Sections of Schedule 13D

1. **Cover Page:** Includes basic information such as the name and contact details of the reporting person, the date of the event, and the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) acquired.
2. **Item 1. [Security](../s/security.md) and [Issuer](../i/issuer.md):** Provides details about the company in which the [shares](../s/shares.md) were purchased.
3. **Item 2. Identity and Background:** Includes information on the reporting persons, such as names, addresses, occupations, and any criminal convictions.
4. **Item 3. Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration:** Specifies where the funds for purchasing the securities came from.
5. **Item 4. Purpose of [Transaction](../t/transaction.md):** Describes the purpose of the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) and any plans regarding the company's future.
6. **Item 5. [Interest](../i/interest.md) in Securities of the [Issuer](../i/issuer.md):** Contains detailed information on the number and percentage of [shares](../s/shares.md) owned.
7. **Item 6. Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings, or Relationships with Respect to Securities of the [Issuer](../i/issuer.md):** Lists any agreements with other parties relating to the securities.
8. **Item 7. Material to Be Filed as Exhibits:** Includes any schedules, agreements, and other exhibits.

## Requirements for Filing

### Filing Deadline

The primary requirement for filing a Schedule 13D is the 10-day deadline following the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) that puts the party's ownership above the 5% threshold. Missing this deadline can result in penalties and legal complications.

### Amendments

If there are any material changes in the information filed (such as additional purchases or changes in ownership percentage), the filer must promptly amend the Schedule 13D. The amendment process follows the same steps as the original filing but uses the form labeled “Schedule 13D/A.”

### Exemptions

There are certain exemptions to filing Schedule 13D. For instance, if the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) is purely passive with no intent to influence or control the [issuer](../i/issuer.md), the filer can submit [Schedule 13G](../s/schedule_13g.md), which has fewer [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) requirements and is simpler.

You can view such filings on [SEC EDGAR](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html).

## Conclusion

Understanding and properly filing Schedule 13D is crucial for compliance with SEC regulations. It ensures [transparency](../t/transparency.md), allows investors to make informed decisions, and helps maintain the integrity of the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). Knowing how to file and the requirements for amendments can prevent legal issues and contribute to a more transparent and efficient investment landscape.

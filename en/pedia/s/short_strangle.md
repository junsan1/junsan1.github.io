# Short Strangle

A short [strangle](../s/strangle.md) is a sophisticated [options](../o/options.md) [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) employed in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), primarily by [options](../o/options.md) traders who expect a stock or any [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) to remain within a certain price [range](../r/range.md). This strategy involves selling an out-of-the-[money](../m/money.md) (OTM) [call option](../c/call_option.md) and an out-of-the-[money](../m/money.md) (OTM) [put option](../p/put.md) simultaneously on the same [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) with the same [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md). The goal is to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on the lack of significant price movement in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), thereby profiting from the premiums received from selling the two [options](../o/options.md).

### Key Concepts

1. **[Options](../o/options.md) Basics**:
    - **[Call Option](../c/call_option.md)**: A financial contract that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at a predetermined price ([strike price](../s/strike_price.md)) before a specified [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md).
    - **[Put Option](../p/put.md)**: A financial contract that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to sell the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at a predetermined price before a specified [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md).
    - **Out-of-the-[Money](../m/money.md) (OTM)**: An option is out-of-the-[money](../m/money.md) if it has no [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md). For a [call option](../c/call_option.md), this means the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) is above the current price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). For a [put option](../p/put.md), the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) is below the current price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

2. **Short [Strangle](../s/strangle.md) Construction**:
    - **Sell OTM [Call Option](../c/call_option.md)**: Writing a [call option](../c/call_option.md) that is out-of-the-[money](../m/money.md).
    - **Sell OTM [Put Option](../p/put.md)**: Writing a [put option](../p/put.md) that is out-of-the-[money](../m/money.md).
    - Both [options](../o/options.md) should have the same [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md).

3. **[Premium](../p/premium.md) [Income](../i/income.md)**: The total [premium](../p/premium.md) received from selling both the OTM call and OTM [put options](../p/put_options.md). This [premium](../p/premium.md) represents the maximum [profit](../p/profit.md) potential for the short [strangle](../s/strangle.md) strategy.

4. **Break-Even Points**: The two price points at which the [trader](../t/trader.md) neither makes nor loses [money](../m/money.md). These are calculated as follows:
    - Upper Break-Even Point: The [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of the [call option](../c/call_option.md) plus the total [premium](../p/premium.md) received.
    - Lower Break-Even Point: The [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of the [put option](../p/put.md) minus the total [premium](../p/premium.md) received.

5. **[Profit](../p/profit.md) and Loss (P&L)**:
    - Maximum [Profit](../p/profit.md): Limited to the total [premium](../p/premium.md) received when initiating the [trade](../t/trade.md).
    - Maximum Loss: Potentially unlimited if the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price moves significantly either upwards or downwards beyond the strike prices of the sold [options](../o/options.md).

6. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Since a short [strangle](../s/strangle.md) involves selling [options](../o/options.md), it exposes the [trader](../t/trader.md) to substantial [risk](../r/risk.md). Proper [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) is crucial, and this typically includes setting [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md), [position sizing](../p/position_sizing.md), and regular monitoring of the [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

### Advantages of Short Strangle

- **Non-Directional Strategy**: A short [strangle](../s/strangle.md) does not require a specific directional movement of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), making it suitable for a [neutral](../n/neutral.md) [market](../m/market.md) outlook.
- **[Time Decay](../t/time_decay.md) ([Theta](../t/theta.md)) Advantage**: The strategy benefits from the [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) of [options](../o/options.md), known as [Theta](../t/theta.md). As the [options](../o/options.md) approach expiration, their [time value](../t/time_value.md) diminishes, allowing the seller to potentially buy them back at a lower price or let them expire worthless.
- **[Volatility](../v/volatility.md) Strategy**: It capitalizes on high implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md) at the time of selling. If the actual [volatility](../v/volatility.md) is lower than expected, the [options](../o/options.md) [will](../w/will.md) lose [value](../v/value.md) faster.

### Disadvantages and Risks

- **Unlimited Loss Potential**: The short [strangle](../s/strangle.md) exposes the [trader](../t/trader.md) to [unlimited risk](../u/unlimited_risk.md) if the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) moves significantly in either direction, causing significant losses.
- **[Margin](../m/margin.md) Requirements**: Because of the high-[risk](../r/risk.md) nature, brokers may require substantial [margin](../m/margin.md) deposits to initiate and maintain a short [strangle](../s/strangle.md) position.
- **Complex Management**: Managing a short [strangle](../s/strangle.md) can be complicated, especially as expiration approaches or if the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) moves near the strike prices of the sold [options](../o/options.md). Traders need to be proactive in adjusting or closing positions to mitigate risks.

### Implementation in Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) involves using automated systems to execute trades based on predefined criteria and [quantitative models](../q/quantitative_models.md). Implementing a short [strangle](../s/strangle.md) strategy in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) requires careful planning and [robust](../r/robust.md) algorithms.

1. **[Market Scanners](../m/market_scanners.md) and Screeners**: Algorithms can scan the [market](../m/market.md) for suitable candidates for a short [strangle](../s/strangle.md) based on criteria such as implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md), trading [volume](../v/volume.md), and price [range](../r/range.md).

2. **Entry Conditions**: Define the conditions under which the algorithm [will](../w/will.md) initiate a short [strangle](../s/strangle.md). This includes selecting the strike prices for the call and [put options](../p/put_options.md), ensuring they are sufficiently out-of-the-[money](../m/money.md), and analyzing the implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md) to determine if it is favorable for selling [options](../o/options.md).

3. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md) Parameters**: Develop [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) protocols within the algorithm, including setting [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md), [position sizing](../p/position_sizing.md) rules, and triggers for adjusting or closing positions if the [market](../m/market.md) moves unfavorably.

4. **[Execution](../e/execution.md) Mechanisms**: Use sophisticated [order types](../o/order_types_in_trading.md) and [execution](../e/execution.md) strategies to ensure that the [options](../o/options.md) are sold at favorable prices, minimizing [slippage](../s/slippage.md) and maximizing [premium](../p/premium.md) received.

5. **Monitoring and Adjustment Routines**: The algorithm should continuously monitor the positions and [market](../m/market.md) conditions. If the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)â€™s price approaches the strike prices, the algorithm may need to adjust the [strangle](../s/strangle.md), such as rolling out to a different [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md) or strike prices.

### Example of Algorithmic Implementation

Let's consider an example of how a short [strangle](../s/strangle.md) could be implemented in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) using Python and a hypothetical [trading platform](../t/trading_platform.md)'s API.

```python
[import](../i/import.md) numpy as np
[import](../i/import.md) datetime
from trading_platform_api [import](../i/import.md) TradingAPI

# Initialize trading API
api = TradingAPI(api_key='your_api_key')

# Define criteria for selecting suitable assets
def select_assets():
    # Get a list of [liquid](../l/liquid.md) assets with sufficient trading [volume](../v/volume.md)
    assets = api.get_liquid_assets(min_trading_volume=100000)
    # Filter assets by implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md)
    [return](../r/return.md) [[asset](../a/asset.md) for [asset](../a/asset.md) in assets if api.get_implied_volatility([asset](../a/asset.md)) > 0.20]

# Define function to create a short strangle
def create_short_strangle([asset](../a/asset.md)):
    # Get current price of the [asset](../a/asset.md)
    current_price = api.get_current_price([asset](../a/asset.md))
    # Define OTM strike prices for call and [put options](../p/put_options.md)
    call_strike = current_price * (1 + 0.10)  # 10% above current price
    put_strike = current_price * (1 - 0.10)  # 10% below current price
    # Define [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md) one month from today
    expiration_date = datetime.date.today() + datetime.timedelta(days=30)
    # Sell OTM [call option](../c/call_option.md)
    call_option = api.sell_option([asset](../a/asset.md), 'call', call_strike, expiration_date)
    # Sell OTM [put option](../p/put.md)
    put_option = api.sell_option([asset](../a/asset.md), 'put', put_strike, expiration_date)
    [return](../r/return.md) call_option, put_option

# Define risk management rules
def manage_risk([asset](../a/asset.md), call_option, put_option):
    # Get current price of the [asset](../a/asset.md)
    current_price = api.get_current_price([asset](../a/asset.md))
    # [Check](../c/check.md) if the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s price moves beyond the break-even points
    upper_break_even = call_option['strike'] + call_option['[premium](../p/premium.md)'] + put_option['[premium](../p/premium.md)']
    lower_break_even = put_option['strike'] - call_option['[premium](../p/premium.md)'] - put_option['[premium](../p/premium.md)']
    if current_price > upper_break_even or current_price < lower_break_even:
        # Close positions to limit losses
        api.close_option(call_option['id'])
        api.close_option(put_option['id'])

# Main trading loop
def main():
    while True:
        # Select suitable assets for short [strangle](../s/strangle.md)
        assets = select_assets()
        for [asset](../a/asset.md) in assets:
            # Create a short [strangle](../s/strangle.md)
            call_option, put_option = create_short_strangle([asset](../a/asset.md))
            # Manage [risk](../r/risk.md)
            manage_risk([asset](../a/asset.md), call_option, put_option)
        # Wait for a defined interval before the next iteration
        time.sleep(60 * 60)  # Run the loop every hour

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

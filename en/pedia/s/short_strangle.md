# Short Strangle

A short strangle is a sophisticated options trading strategy employed in the financial markets, primarily by options traders who expect a stock or any underlying asset to remain within a certain price range. This strategy involves selling an out-of-the-money (OTM) call option and an out-of-the-money (OTM) put option simultaneously on the same underlying asset with the same expiration date. The goal is to capitalize on the lack of significant price movement in the underlying asset, thereby profiting from the premiums received from selling the two options.

### Key Concepts

1. **Options Basics**:
    - **Call Option**: A financial contract that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the underlying asset at a predetermined price (strike price) before a specified expiration date.
    - **Put Option**: A financial contract that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price before a specified expiration date.
    - **Out-of-the-Money (OTM)**: An option is out-of-the-money if it has no intrinsic value. For a call option, this means the strike price is above the current price of the underlying asset. For a put option, the strike price is below the current price of the underlying asset.

2. **Short Strangle Construction**:
    - **Sell OTM Call Option**: Writing a call option that is out-of-the-money.
    - **Sell OTM Put Option**: Writing a put option that is out-of-the-money.
    - Both options should have the same expiration date.

3. **Premium Income**: The total premium received from selling both the OTM call and OTM [put options](../p/put_options.md). This premium represents the maximum profit potential for the short strangle strategy.

4. **Break-Even Points**: The two price points at which the trader neither makes nor loses money. These are calculated as follows:
    - Upper Break-Even Point: The strike price of the call option plus the total premium received.
    - Lower Break-Even Point: The strike price of the put option minus the total premium received.

5. **Profit and Loss (P&L)**:
    - Maximum Profit: Limited to the total premium received when initiating the trade.
    - Maximum Loss: Potentially unlimited if the underlying asset's price moves significantly either upwards or downwards beyond the strike prices of the sold options.

6. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Since a short strangle involves selling options, it exposes the trader to substantial risk. Proper [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) is crucial, and this typically includes setting [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md), [position sizing](../p/position_sizing.md), and regular monitoring of the market conditions.

### Advantages of Short Strangle

- **Non-Directional Strategy**: A short strangle does not require a specific directional movement of the underlying asset, making it suitable for a neutral market outlook.
- **Time Decay (Theta) Advantage**: The strategy benefits from the time decay of options, known as Theta. As the options approach expiration, their time value diminishes, allowing the seller to potentially buy them back at a lower price or let them expire worthless.
- **Volatility Strategy**: It capitalizes on high implied volatility at the time of selling. If the actual volatility is lower than expected, the options will lose value faster.

### Disadvantages and Risks

- **Unlimited Loss Potential**: The short strangle exposes the trader to unlimited risk if the underlying asset moves significantly in either direction, causing significant losses.
- **Margin Requirements**: Because of the high-risk nature, brokers may require substantial margin deposits to initiate and maintain a short strangle position.
- **Complex Management**: Managing a short strangle can be complicated, especially as expiration approaches or if the underlying asset moves near the strike prices of the sold options. Traders need to be proactive in adjusting or closing positions to mitigate risks.

### Implementation in Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) involves using automated systems to execute trades based on predefined criteria and [quantitative models](../q/quantitative_models.md). Implementing a short strangle strategy in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) requires careful planning and robust algorithms.

1. **[Market Scanners](../m/market_scanners.md) and Screeners**: Algorithms can scan the market for suitable candidates for a short strangle based on criteria such as implied volatility, trading volume, and price range.

2. **Entry Conditions**: Define the conditions under which the algorithm will initiate a short strangle. This includes selecting the strike prices for the call and [put options](../p/put_options.md), ensuring they are sufficiently out-of-the-money, and analyzing the implied volatility to determine if it is favorable for selling options.

3. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md) Parameters**: Develop [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) protocols within the algorithm, including setting [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md), [position sizing](../p/position_sizing.md) rules, and triggers for adjusting or closing positions if the market moves unfavorably.

4. **Execution Mechanisms**: Use sophisticated [order types](../o/order_types_in_trading.md) and execution strategies to ensure that the options are sold at favorable prices, minimizing slippage and maximizing premium received.

5. **Monitoring and Adjustment Routines**: The algorithm should continuously monitor the positions and market conditions. If the underlying assetâ€™s price approaches the strike prices, the algorithm may need to adjust the strangle, such as rolling out to a different expiration date or strike prices.

### Example of Algorithmic Implementation

Let's consider an example of how a short strangle could be implemented in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) using Python and a hypothetical trading platform's API.

```python
import numpy as np
import datetime
from trading_platform_api import TradingAPI

# Initialize trading API
api = TradingAPI(api_key='your_api_key')

# Define criteria for selecting suitable assets
def select_assets():
    # Get a list of liquid assets with sufficient trading volume
    assets = api.get_liquid_assets(min_trading_volume=100000)
    # Filter assets by implied volatility
    return [asset for asset in assets if api.get_implied_volatility(asset) > 0.20]

# Define function to create a short strangle
def create_short_strangle(asset):
    # Get current price of the asset
    current_price = api.get_current_price(asset)
    # Define OTM strike prices for call and [put options](../p/put_options.md)
    call_strike = current_price * (1 + 0.10)  # 10% above current price
    put_strike = current_price * (1 - 0.10)  # 10% below current price
    # Define expiration date one month from today
    expiration_date = datetime.date.today() + datetime.timedelta(days=30)
    # Sell OTM call option
    call_option = api.sell_option(asset, 'call', call_strike, expiration_date)
    # Sell OTM put option
    put_option = api.sell_option(asset, 'put', put_strike, expiration_date)
    return call_option, put_option

# Define risk management rules
def manage_risk(asset, call_option, put_option):
    # Get current price of the asset
    current_price = api.get_current_price(asset)
    # Check if the asset's price moves beyond the break-even points
    upper_break_even = call_option['strike'] + call_option['premium'] + put_option['premium']
    lower_break_even = put_option['strike'] - call_option['premium'] - put_option['premium']
    if current_price > upper_break_even or current_price < lower_break_even:
        # Close positions to limit losses
        api.close_option(call_option['id'])
        api.close_option(put_option['id'])

# Main trading loop
def main():
    while True:
        # Select suitable assets for short strangle
        assets = select_assets()
        for asset in assets:
            # Create a short strangle
            call_option, put_option = create_short_strangle(asset)
            # Manage risk
            manage_risk(asset, call_option, put_option)
        # Wait for a defined interval before the next iteration
        time.sleep(60 * 60)  # Run the loop every hour

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

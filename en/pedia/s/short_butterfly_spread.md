# Short Butterfly Spread

## Introduction

A Short [Butterfly Spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md) is an options trading strategy that is primarily used when a trader expects minimal movement in the price of the underlying asset. This strategy involves the simultaneous buying and selling of options with three different strike prices, forming a butterfly shape when graphed according to payoff at different price points at expiration. Particularly well-suited for traders who predict low volatility, the Short [Butterfly Spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md) aims to capitalize on the passage of time and the associated decay in option premiums.

## Components of Short Butterfly Spread

### Key Elements:

1. **Underlying Asset**: The financial instrument on which options are written, such as a stock, index, or commodity.
2. **Options**: Financial [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) that provide the buyer with the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price before or on a specific date.
3. **Strike Prices**: Prices at which options may be exercised.
4. **Expiration Date**: The date on which the option expires.

### Constructing the Short Butterfly Spread:

- **Sell One Lower Strike Call**: Sell one call option with a lower strike price.
- **Buy Two Middle Strike Calls**: Buy two call options at a middle strike price.
- **Sell One Higher Strike Call**: Sell one call option with a higher strike price.

### Example Structure:

Assume the underlying asset is trading at $100:
- Sell 1 call option with a strike price of $95.
- Buy 2 call options with a strike price of $100.
- Sell 1 call option with a strike price of $105.

## Payoff Characteristics

### Maximum Loss:

The maximum loss occurs if the underlying asset's price is either below the lower strike price or above the higher strike price at expiration. The loss is limited to the net premium paid to establish the Short [Butterfly Spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md).

### Maximum Profit:

The maximum profit is achieved when the underlying asset's price is at the middle strike price at expiration. At this point, the trader benefits from the premiums received from the sold options while the purchased options are worthless or minimally valuable but less than the total received premiums.

### Breakeven Points:

The breakeven points are derived from the net premium and the strike prices. There are two breakeven points:
- Lower Breakeven Point = Lower Strike Price + Net Premium
- Upper Breakeven Point = Higher Strike Price - Net Premium

## Benefits of Short Butterfly Spread

### Limited Risk:

One of the primary advantages of the Short [Butterfly Spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md) is its limited risk. Unlike naked options or short straddles, the trader's potential loss is capped, making this strategy appealing for those with a lower risk tolerance.

### Low Volatility Environment:

This strategy thrives in low volatility markets. When asset prices aren't expected to move significantly, Short Butterfly Spreads can offer a profitable way to earn from time decay.

### Defined Profit and Loss:

The well-defined nature of potential profits and losses appeals to disciplined traders. It allows for precise planning and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md).

## Potential Drawbacks

### Complex Strategy:

Constructing and managing a Short [Butterfly Spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md) requires a good understanding of options pricing and behavior. Novice traders might find it complex compared to simpler strategies like covered calls or naked puts.

### Limited Profit Potential:

Despite offering defined profits, the potential gains from Short Butterfly Spreads are relatively modest. This might not appeal to traders looking for high-reward opportunities.

## Practical Applications

### Market Predictions:

A practical scenario for using a Short [Butterfly Spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md) is when a trader believes that a stock will not undergo significant price movements in the short term. For instance, during stable economic periods when companies are performing predictably, this strategy can be beneficial.

### Earnings Season:

Stocks tend to be more volatile around [earnings announcements](../e/earnings_announcements.md). However, if a trader believes that there will be minimal movement, a Short [Butterfly Spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md) can be strategically placed just before the earnings release.

# Short Butterfly Spread

## Introduction

A Short [Butterfly Spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md) is an [options](../o/options.md) [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) that is primarily used when a [trader](../t/trader.md) expects minimal movement in the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). This strategy involves the simultaneous buying and selling of [options](../o/options.md) with three different strike prices, forming a butterfly shape when graphed according to payoff at different price points at expiration. Particularly well-suited for traders who predict low [volatility](../v/volatility.md), the Short [Butterfly Spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md) aims to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on the passage of time and the associated decay in option premiums.

## Components of Short Butterfly Spread

### Key Elements:

1. **[Underlying Asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)**: The [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) on which [options](../o/options.md) are written, such as a stock, [index](../i/index_instrument.md), or [commodity](../c/commodity.md).
2. **[Options](../o/options.md)**: Financial [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) that provide the buyer with the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at a predetermined price before or on a specific date.
3. **Strike Prices**: Prices at which [options](../o/options.md) may be exercised.
4. **[Expiration Date](../e/expiration_date.md)**: The date on which the option expires.

### Constructing the Short Butterfly Spread:

- **Sell One Lower Strike Call**: Sell one [call option](../c/call_option.md) with a lower [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).
- **Buy Two Middle Strike Calls**: Buy two call [options](../o/options.md) at a middle [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).
- **Sell One Higher Strike Call**: Sell one [call option](../c/call_option.md) with a higher [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).

### Example Structure:

Assume the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) is trading at $100:
- Sell 1 [call option](../c/call_option.md) with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $95.
- Buy 2 call [options](../o/options.md) with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $100.
- Sell 1 [call option](../c/call_option.md) with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $105.

## Payoff Characteristics

### Maximum Loss:

The maximum loss occurs if the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price is either below the lower [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) or above the higher [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) at expiration. The loss is limited to the [net premium](../n/net_premium.md) paid to establish the Short [Butterfly Spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md).

### Maximum Profit:

The maximum [profit](../p/profit.md) is achieved when the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price is at the middle [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) at expiration. At this point, the [trader](../t/trader.md) benefits from the premiums received from the sold [options](../o/options.md) while the purchased [options](../o/options.md) are worthless or minimally valuable but less than the total received premiums.

### Breakeven Points:

The breakeven points are derived from the [net premium](../n/net_premium.md) and the strike prices. There are two breakeven points:
- Lower [Breakeven Point](../b/breakeven_point.md) = Lower [Strike Price](../s/strike_price.md) + [Net Premium](../n/net_premium.md)
- Upper [Breakeven Point](../b/breakeven_point.md) = Higher [Strike Price](../s/strike_price.md) - [Net Premium](../n/net_premium.md)

## Benefits of Short Butterfly Spread

### Limited Risk:

One of the primary advantages of the Short [Butterfly Spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md) is its limited [risk](../r/risk.md). Unlike naked [options](../o/options.md) or short straddles, the [trader](../t/trader.md)'s potential loss is capped, making this strategy appealing for those with a lower [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md).

### Low Volatility Environment:

This strategy thrives in low [volatility](../v/volatility.md) markets. When [asset](../a/asset.md) prices aren't expected to move significantly, Short Butterfly [Spreads](../s/spreads.md) can [offer](../o/offer.md) a profitable way to earn from [time decay](../t/time_decay.md).

### Defined Profit and Loss:

The well-defined nature of potential profits and losses appeals to disciplined traders. It allows for precise planning and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md).

## Potential Drawbacks

### Complex Strategy:

Constructing and managing a Short [Butterfly Spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md) requires a good understanding of [options](../o/options.md) pricing and behavior. Novice traders might find it complex compared to simpler strategies like covered calls or naked puts.

### Limited Profit Potential:

Despite [offering](../o/offering.md) defined profits, the potential gains from Short Butterfly [Spreads](../s/spreads.md) are relatively modest. This might not appeal to traders looking for high-reward opportunities.

## Practical Applications

### Market Predictions:

A practical scenario for using a Short [Butterfly Spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md) is when a [trader](../t/trader.md) believes that a stock [will](../w/will.md) not undergo significant price movements in the short term. For instance, during stable economic periods when companies are performing predictably, this strategy can be beneficial.

### Earnings Season:

[Stocks](../s/stock.md) tend to be more volatile around [earnings announcements](../e/earnings_announcements.md). However, if a [trader](../t/trader.md) believes that there [will](../w/will.md) be minimal movement, a Short [Butterfly Spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md) can be strategically placed just before the [earnings](../e/earnings.md) release.

## Conclusion

By combining [options](../o/options.md) with three different strike prices, traders can benefit from minimal price movements and the natural [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) of option premiums. While the potential for [profit](../p/profit.md) is capped, so too is the [risk](../r/risk.md) of loss, providing a balanced approach to [options](../o/options.md) trading.

Understanding and effectively utilizing the Short [Butterfly Spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md) requires a solid understanding of [options](../o/options.md) dynamics, but when executed correctly, it can be a profitable strategy for traders who anticipate little price movement in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

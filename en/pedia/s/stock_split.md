# Stock Split

A stock split is a corporate action in which a company divides its existing shares into multiple shares to boost the liquidity of the shares. Although the number of shares outstanding increases by a specific multiple, the total value of the shares remains the same compared to pre-split amounts, because the split does not add any real value. The most common types of stock splits are 2-for-1, 3-for-1, and 3-for-2. When a company issues a 2-for-1 stock split, each share held by a shareholder is "split" into two shares. Therefore, the number of shares outstanding is doubled. 

Stock splits can also occur in reverse, known as a reverse stock split, where a company reduces the number of shares outstanding, increasing the share price correspondingly. For instance, in a 1-for-10 reverse stock split, shareholders receive one share for every 10 shares they own, and the share price will increase by a factor of 10.

## Purpose of Stock Splits

1. **Increase Liquidity**: By reducing the price per share, the stock becomes more attractive to small investors, due to its lower cost, potentially increasing market liquidity.

2. **Prestige and Psychological Impact**: Companies may employ stock splits to align their stock price with psychologically appealing ranges. A low price might suggest undervaluation, while a very high price might deter small investors.

3. **Broaden Shareholder Base**: A lower stock price can attract a more diverse range of investors, increasing the shareholder base and providing the company with a more stable stock performance.

4. **Improved Index Placement**: Stocks with higher liquidity and lower nominal prices can make it easier for the stock to be included or retained in benchmark indices.

## Example of Stock Split

If Company XYZ's stock is trading at $200 per share and decides on a 2-for-1 stock split:
- Each shareholder with 1 share will receive an additional share.
- The price per share will be adjusted to $100.
- If an investor owned 100 shares before the split, they would own 200 shares after.

## Impact on Shareholders

The value of an investor's holding won't change at the time of the split. Continuing the XYZ example, an investor with 100 shares valued at $200 each would see their total investment remain at $20,000 even post-split (200 shares valued at $100 each).

## Key Considerations

1. **Non-Dilutive Action**: A stock split does not dilute ownership stakes. While the number of shares outstanding increases, the percentage ownership remains the same for each shareholder.

2. **Potential Market Reactions**: While a stock split can signal company growth and lead towards positive market reactions, it is not inherently indicative of financial improvements.

3. **Tax Implications**: Stock splits do not create taxable events for shareholders. Their cost basis is adjusted to reflect the split, impacting capital gains calculations when shares are sold.

## Notable Examples

- **Apple Inc.**: Apple has had several stock splits, with the most recent being a 4-for-1 stock split in August 2020. For more information, see their investor relations page: https://investor.apple.com

- **Tesla Inc.**: Tesla executed a 5-for-1 stock split in August 2020 to make shares more affordable for investors. For more information, visit: https://ir.tesla.com

## Reverse Stock Split

Opposite to stock splits, reverse stock splits consolidate the number of existing shares into fewer, higher-valued shares. For example, in a 1-for-5 reverse stock split:
- If an investor owned 500 shares at $2 per share, post-split, they would own 100 shares valued at $10 per share.
- The overall value of the investment remains the same at $1,000.

### Reasons for Reverse Stock Split

1. **Compliance with Listing Requirements**: Companies trading below minimum required price levels might execute reverse splits to ensure continued listing on stock exchanges.
   
2. **Improving Perceived Value**: A higher share price might improve the stock's appeal among investors and analysts.

3. **Reducing Share Count**: This may be a strategy to consolidate ownership and decrease the volatility caused by a large number of shareholders holding small quantities of shares.

### Example of Reverse Stock Split

- **American International Group (AIG)**: In 2009, AIG conducted a 1-for-20 reverse stock split. More details regarding their reverse split can be found at: https://www.aig.com

## Conclusion

Stock splits are strategic tools used by companies to enhance the accessibility and attractiveness of their stock, while reverse stock splits help firms manage share price levels and market perceptions. Investors should understand the mechanics and implications of these corporate actions as they decide on investment strategies and interpret stock performance.

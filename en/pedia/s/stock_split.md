# Stock Split

A stock split is a corporate action in which a company divides its existing [shares](../s/shares.md) into [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [shares](../s/shares.md) to boost the [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) of the [shares](../s/shares.md). Although the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) outstanding increases by a specific [multiple](../m/multiple.md), the total [value](../v/value.md) of the [shares](../s/shares.md) remains the same compared to pre-split amounts, because the split does not add any real [value](../v/value.md). The most common types of stock splits are 2-for-1, 3-for-1, and 3-for-2. When a company issues a 2-for-1 stock split, each share held by a [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) is "split" into two [shares](../s/shares.md). Therefore, the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) outstanding is doubled. 

Stock splits can also occur in reverse, known as a [reverse stock split](../r/reverse_stock_split.md), where a company reduces the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) outstanding, increasing the share price correspondingly. For instance, in a 1-for-10 [reverse stock split](../r/reverse_stock_split.md), shareholders receive one share for every 10 [shares](../s/shares.md) they own, and the share price [will](../w/will.md) increase by a [factor](../f/factor.md) of 10.

## Purpose of Stock Splits

1. **Increase [Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)**: By reducing the price per share, the stock becomes more attractive to small investors, due to its lower cost, potentially increasing [market](../m/market.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).

2. **Prestige and Psychological Impact**: Companies may employ stock splits to align their stock price with psychologically appealing ranges. A low price might suggest undervaluation, while a very high price might deter small investors.

3. **Broaden [Shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) Base**: A lower stock price can attract a more diverse [range](../r/range.md) of investors, increasing the [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) base and providing the company with a more stable stock performance.

4. **Improved [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) Placement**: [Stocks](../s/stock.md) with higher [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and lower [nominal](../n/nominal.md) prices can make it easier for the stock to be included or retained in [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) indices.

## Example of Stock Split

If Company XYZ's stock is trading at $200 per share and decides on a 2-for-1 stock split:
- Each [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) with 1 share [will](../w/will.md) receive an additional share.
- The price per share [will](../w/will.md) be adjusted to $100.
- If an [investor](../i/investor.md) owned 100 [shares](../s/shares.md) before the split, they would own 200 [shares](../s/shares.md) after.

## Impact on Shareholders

The [value](../v/value.md) of an [investor](../i/investor.md)'s holding won't change at the time of the split. Continuing the XYZ example, an [investor](../i/investor.md) with 100 [shares](../s/shares.md) valued at $200 each would see their total investment remain at $20,000 even post-split (200 [shares](../s/shares.md) valued at $100 each).

## Key Considerations

1. **Non-Dilutive Action**: A stock split does not dilute ownership stakes. While the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) outstanding increases, the percentage ownership remains the same for each [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md).

2. **Potential [Market](../m/market.md) Reactions**: While a stock split can signal company growth and lead towards positive [market](../m/market.md) reactions, it is not inherently indicative of financial improvements.

3. **Tax Implications**: Stock splits do not create taxable events for shareholders. Their [cost basis](../c/cost_basis.md) is adjusted to reflect the split, impacting [capital](../c/capital.md) gains calculations when [shares](../s/shares.md) are sold.

## Notable Examples

- **Apple Inc.**: Apple has had several stock splits, with the most recent being a 4-for-1 stock split in August 2020. For more information, see their [investor relations](../i/investor_relations.md) page: https://[investor](../i/investor.md).apple.com

- **Tesla Inc.**: Tesla executed a 5-for-1 stock split in August 2020 to make [shares](../s/shares.md) more affordable for investors. For more information, visit: https://ir.tesla.com

## Reverse Stock Split

Opposite to stock splits, [reverse stock splits](../r/reverse_stock_splits.md) consolidate the number of existing [shares](../s/shares.md) into fewer, higher-valued [shares](../s/shares.md). For example, in a 1-for-5 [reverse stock split](../r/reverse_stock_split.md):
- If an [investor](../i/investor.md) owned 500 [shares](../s/shares.md) at $2 per share, post-split, they would own 100 [shares](../s/shares.md) valued at $10 per share.
- The overall [value](../v/value.md) of the investment remains the same at $1,000.

### Reasons for Reverse Stock Split

1. **Compliance with [Listing Requirements](../l/listing_requirements.md)**: Companies trading below minimum required price levels might execute reverse splits to ensure continued listing on stock exchanges.
   
2. **Improving [Perceived Value](../p/perceived_value.md)**: A higher share price might improve the stock's appeal among investors and analysts.

3. **Reducing Share Count**: This may be a strategy to consolidate ownership and decrease the [volatility](../v/volatility.md) caused by a large number of shareholders holding small quantities of [shares](../s/shares.md).

### Example of Reverse Stock Split

- **American International Group (AIG)**: In 2009, AIG conducted a 1-for-20 [reverse stock split](../r/reverse_stock_split.md). More details regarding their reverse split can be found at: https://www.aig.com

## Conclusion

Stock splits are strategic tools used by companies to enhance the accessibility and attractiveness of their stock, while [reverse stock splits](../r/reverse_stock_splits.md) help firms manage share price levels and [market](../m/market.md) perceptions. Investors should understand the mechanics and implications of these corporate actions as they decide on investment strategies and interpret stock performance.

# Stock Option

A stock option is a financial [derivative](../d/derivative.md) that grants the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specific number of [shares](../s/shares.md) of a company's stock at a specific price, known as the [exercise](../e/exercise.md) or [strike price](../s/strike_price.md), within a certain period. Stock [options](../o/options.md) are commonly used in both [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md) and investment strategies, and their [valuation](../v/valuation.md) and strategic uses can be complex.

## Types of Stock Options

### Call Options
A [call option](../c/call_option.md) gives the holder the right to buy [shares](../s/shares.md) at the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md). Investors buy call [options](../o/options.md) when they anticipate that the price of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock [will](../w/will.md) rise.

### Put Options
A [put option](../p/put.md) gives the holder the right to sell [shares](../s/shares.md) at the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md). Investors buy [put options](../p/put_options.md) when they anticipate that the price of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock [will](../w/will.md) decrease.

## Key Terms and Concepts

### Strike Price
The [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) is the fixed price at which the holder of the option can buy (in case of a [call option](../c/call_option.md)) or sell (in case of a [put option](../p/put.md)) the [underlying security](../u/underlying_security.md).

### Expiry Date
[Options](../o/options.md) have an expiry date, which is the last date on which the option can be exercised.

### Premium
The [option premium](../o/option_premium.md) is the price the buyer pays for the option contract itself. It is influenced by various factors including the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock price, [volatility](../v/volatility.md), expiry period, and [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

### In-the-Money (ITM)
An option is in-the-[money](../m/money.md) if exercising the option would result in a positive payoff. For a [call option](../c/call_option.md), this occurs when the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock price is above the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md). For a [put option](../p/put.md), this occurs when the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock price is below the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).

### Out-of-the-Money (OTM)
An option is out-of-the-[money](../m/money.md) if exercising the option would not result in a positive payoff. For a [call option](../c/call_option.md), this occurs when the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock price is below the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md). For a [put option](../p/put.md), this occurs when the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock price is above the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).

### At-the-Money (ATM)
An option is at-the-[money](../m/money.md) when the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock price is exactly equal to the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).

## Valuation Models

### The Black-Scholes Model
One of the most widely used models for pricing European-style [options](../o/options.md) is the [Black-Scholes model](../b/black-scholes_model.md). It takes into account factors such as the current stock price, the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md), time until expiration, [volatility](../v/volatility.md), and the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md).

### The Binomial Model
The [Binomial Option Pricing Model](../b/binomial_option_pricing_model.md) provides a more flexible framework that is particularly useful for American-style [options](../o/options.md), which can be exercised at any time before expiration.

## Strategies Involving Stock Options

### Covered Calls
A [covered call](../c/covered_call.md) strategy involves holding the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock and selling a [call option](../c/call_option.md) on the same stock to generate [income](../i/income.md) from the [option premium](../o/option_premium.md).

### Protective Puts
A [protective put](../p/protective_put.md) strategy involves holding the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock and buying a [put option](../p/put.md) on the same stock to limit potential losses.

### Straddles and Strangles
Both of these strategies involve buying both a call and a [put option](../p/put.md) on the same stock with the same expiry date. In a [straddle](../s/straddle.md), the strike prices are the same, while in a [strangle](../s/strangle.md), the strike prices are different.

## Employee Stock Options

### Incentive Stock Options (ISOs)
ISOs are a type of employee stock option that can only be offered to employees and come with tax benefits, provided certain conditions are met.

### Non-Qualified Stock Options (NSOs)
NSOs do not qualify for special tax treatments and can be offered to employees, directors, contractors, and others.

## Risks and Benefits

### Benefits
- Potential for significant gains with limited initial investment.
- Flexibility in terms of strategic implementations.
- Hedging against potential stock price declines.

### Risks
- [Options](../o/options.md) can expire worthless, leading to a total loss of [premium](../p/premium.md) paid.
- Complexity in understanding and executing various strategies.
- [Market](../m/market.md) risks including [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) issues.

## Regulatory Environment

Stock [options](../o/options.md) are regulated by various financial bodies and are subject to rules and guidelines designed to protect investors. In the United States, the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) regulates [options](../o/options.md) trading.

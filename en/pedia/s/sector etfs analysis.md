# Sector ETFs Analysis

## Introduction to Sector ETFs

Sector ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) are financial products that allow investors to gain exposure to specific sectors of the economy through a single investment vehicle. Unlike broad market ETFs, which may cover entire indices such as the S&P 500, sector ETFs focus exclusively on one particular segment of the market, such as technology, healthcare, financials, or consumer staples. This focus allows investors to tailor their portfolios to reflect their economic outlook or to hedge against specific sector risks.

# Sukuk

Sukuk, also known as Islamic bonds, are financial certificates that comply with Islamic law (Shariah). Unlike conventional bonds that earn [interest](../i/interest.md), Sukuk are structured in such a way as to generate returns to investors without infringing Islamic law prohibiting [interest](../i/interest.md). Instead of [interest](../i/interest.md), Sukuk investors receive a share of the [income](../i/income.md) generated by the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). This makes Sukuk an essential element of Islamic [finance](../f/finance.md), emphasizing [risk](../r/risk.md)-sharing and ethical investment.

## Historical Background

The concept of Sukuk is deeply rooted in Islamic jurisprudence and emerged as part of the broader practice of [trade](../t/trade.md) and [financing](../f/financing.md) activities conforming to Shariah principles. The modern development of Sukuk can be traced back to the 1970s and 1980s, with the first Sukuk issuance in Malaysia by Shell MDS in 1990.

## Key Features

### Compliance with Shariah Law

One of the most critical aspects of Sukuk is adhering to Shariah principles, core among which is the prohibition of riba ([interest](../i/interest.md)). Profits generated from Sukuk must come from [business](../b/business.md) risks and rewards rather than guaranteed [interest](../i/interest.md) payments.

### Asset-Backed Securities

Sukuk must be backed by [tangible assets](../t/tangible_asset.md). This is a defining characteristic distinguishing Sukuk from conventional bonds, which typically represent [debt](../d/debt.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md). The assets could be physical ([real estate](../r/real_estate.md), machinery) or [usufruct](../u/usufruct.md) (right to use and derive [profit](../p/profit.md) from the property).

### Types of Sukuk

Several structures of Sukuk exist, each aligned with different Islamic contracts:

1. **Ijara Sukuk**: Based on a lease agreement where the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) sells the certificate to investors and then leases the [asset](../a/asset.md) back, with periodic [lease payments](../l/lease_payments.md) representing the [return](../r/return.md).

2. **[Murabaha](../m/murabaha.md) Sukuk**: Involves the [sale](../s/sale.md) of commodities or assets with deferred payments, compliant with Shariah laws governing cost-plus sales.

3. **Mudarabah Sukuk**: Relies on a partnership where one party provides the [capital](../c/capital.md) while the other offers expertise and management. Profits are shared according to pre-agreed ratios.

4. **[Musharakah](../m/musharakah.md) Sukuk**: Similar to Mudarabah but involves a partnership where all parties contribute [capital](../c/capital.md) and share profits and losses.

5. **Istisna Sukuk**: Based on a contract of [sale](../s/sale.md) for goods to be manufactured or constructed, with [payment](../p/payment.md) typically made in stages according to the project’s progress.

6. **Salam Sukuk**: Involves [advance payment](../a/advance_payment.md) for goods to be delivered at a future date, commonly used in agricultural contracts.

### Structured Products and Complexity

Some Sukuk structures may become highly complex, involving several contracts and legal documentation to ensure compliance with both Shariah principles and regulatory frameworks within various jurisdictions.

### Profit Distribution

The returns on Sukuk are distributed as [profit](../p/profit.md)-sharing rather than [interest](../i/interest.md) payments. The nature of these returns is linked to the performance and [income](../i/income.md) generated from the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets or ventures.

### Risk and Credit Enhancements

The [risk](../r/risk.md) profile of Sukuk differs from traditional bonds, given the [asset](../a/asset.md)-backed nature. However, to attract a broader pool of investors, some Sukuk issues may come with [credit](../c/credit.md) enhancements to improve [credit](../c/credit.md) ratings, like guarantees or [collateral](../c/collateral.md) arrangements.

## Regulatory and Standardization Efforts

The global Sukuk [market](../m/market.md) has seen significant growth driven by increased [demand](../d/demand.md) from Muslim-majority nations and ethical investors worldwide. Governing bodies such as the [Accounting](../a/accounting.md) and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI) and the Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB) develop standards to ensure Sukuk’s conformity with Shariah principles.

### Conventional vs. Islamic Jurisdiction

Different jurisdictions have varying degrees of Sukuk adoption and regulatory frameworks. Countries like Malaysia and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states have established comprehensive regulatory environments to support Sukuk issuances.

## Notable Sukuk Issuances

1. **Malaysia**: Malaysia, being a pioneer in Islamic [finance](../f/finance.md), has actively promoted Sukuk as a [financing](../f/financing.md) tool for [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) projects, including the iconic Petronas Twin Towers.

2. **Dubai**: Dubai uses Sukuk to [finance](../f/finance.md) various development projects, including the Dubai International Financial Center and [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) developments.

3. **United Kingdom**: The UK became the first Western government to [issue](../i/issue.md) sovereign Sukuk in 2014, marking a significant milestone and reflecting the growing acceptance of Sukuk in non-Muslim-majority countries.

## Comparison with Conventional Bonds

### Similarities
- Both Sukuk and conventional bonds are mechanisms for raising [capital](../c/capital.md) through [debt](../d/debt.md)-like instruments.
- They both [offer](../o/offer.md) returns to investors, often with scheduled payouts.

### Differences
- **Shariah Compliance**: Conventional bonds are [interest](../i/interest.md)-bearing, whereas Sukuk returns are linked to [asset](../a/asset.md) performance and [profit](../p/profit.md)-sharing.
- **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Sharing**: Sukuk emphasizes [risk](../r/risk.md)-sharing between issuers and investors, compared to the fixed [interest](../i/interest.md) commitments of conventional bonds.
- **[Asset](../a/asset.md)-Backed**: Sukuk must be backed by [tangible assets](../t/tangible_asset.md) or usufructs.

## Market Dynamics

### Growth Trends

The global Sukuk [market](../m/market.md) has been growing steadily, with issuances coming from both sovereign and corporate sectors. Factors driving growth include growing acceptance of Islamic [finance](../f/finance.md), [diversification](../d/diversification.md) needs of investors, and the increasing number of ethical investment funds.

### Challenges

- **Complexity and Cost**: Structuring Sukuk to comply with Shariah laws can be more complex and costly compared to conventional bonds.
- **Legal and Regulatory Challenges**: Varying interpretations of Shariah across different jurisdictions can affect the uniformity and marketability of Sukuk.
- **[Market](../m/market.md) [Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)**: The [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md) for Sukuk can be less [liquid](../l/liquid.md) compared to conventional bonds, which may impact trading and [price discovery](../p/price_discovery.md).

### Future Outlook

As the world gravitates towards ethical and sustainable [financing](../f/financing.md), Sukuk are positioned to play a significant role, especially in projects aligned with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria. With technology integration and continued regulatory harmonization, the [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and comprehensiveness of the Sukuk [market](../m/market.md) are expected to improve.

## Conclusion

Sukuk represents a unique [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) blending the ethical principles of Islam with modern [finance](../f/finance.md). Its [asset](../a/asset.md)-backed, [profit](../p/profit.md)-sharing nature offers investors an alternative to conventional bonds, with the added benefit of adherence to Shariah law. As global [interest](../i/interest.md) in ethical and socially responsible [investing](../i/investing.md) grows, Sukuk are set to become an increasingly vital component of the global financial landscape.

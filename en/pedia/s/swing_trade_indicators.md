# Swing Trade Indicators

### Moving Averages (MA)

Moving averages are one of the most common and useful [swing trading](../s/swing_trading.md) indicators. They smooth out price data to identify the direction of the [trend](../t/trend.md). The most popular types of moving averages are the Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the Exponential Moving Average (EMA). 

**Simple Moving Average (SMA)**  
The SMA calculates the average of a selected [range](../r/range.md) of prices, usually closing prices, by the number of periods in that [range](../r/range.md). For example, a 20-day SMA sums up the closing prices of the last 20 days and divides by 20.

**Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**  
The EMA gives more weight to recent prices, making it more responsive to new information. This can be particularly useful for swing traders who need to quickly respond to price changes.

### Relative Strength Index (RSI)

The RSI is a [momentum](../m/momentum.md) [oscillator](../o/oscillator.md) that measures the speed and change of price movements. The RSI oscillates between 0 and 100 and is typically used to identify [overbought](../o/overbought.md) or [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions. A reading above 70 suggests that a stock may be [overbought](../o/overbought.md), while a reading below 30 indicates that it may be [oversold](../o/oversold.md).

### Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)

The MACD is a [trend](../t/trend.md)-following [momentum](../m/momentum.md) [indicator](../i/indicator.md) that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a [security](../s/security.md)’s price. It consists of the MACD line, the signal line, and the [histogram](../h/histogram.md).

**MACD Line**  
Calculated by subtracting the 26-period EMA from the 12-period EMA.

**Signal Line**  
A 9-period EMA of the MACD line plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy and sell signals.

**[Histogram](../h/histogram.md)**  
It represents the difference between the MACD line and the signal line. When the [histogram](../h/histogram.md) is above zero, it indicates a bullish [trend](../t/trend.md), and when it is below zero, it indicates a bearish [trend](../t/trend.md).

### Bollinger Bands

[Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md) consist of a middle band being an N-period moving average, and two outer bands that are N-period standard deviations away from the middle band. These bands adjust to [volatility](../v/volatility.md): they expand during periods of high [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and contract during periods of low [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

- **Upper Band**: SMA + 2 standard deviations
- **Lower Band**: SMA - 2 standard deviations

### Fibonacci Retracement

This tool is used to identify potential [reversal](../r/reversal.md) levels by plotting horizontal lines at key Fibonacci levels (23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 100%) between a high and low point. The idea is that price may retrace a predictable portion of a move, after which it continues in its original direction.

### Stochastic Oscillator

The [stochastic oscillator](../s/stochastic_oscillator.md) is another [momentum](../m/momentum.md) [indicator](../i/indicator.md) that compares a particular closing price to a [range](../r/range.md) of prices over a certain period of time. The sensitivity of the [oscillator](../o/oscillator.md) to [market](../m/market.md) movements can be reduced by adjusting the timeframe or by taking a moving average of the result.

- **%K**: The current closing price compared to the high/low [range](../r/range.md) over a specific period.
- **%D**: A moving average of the %K.

### Average Directional Index (ADX)

The ADX measures the strength of a [trend](../t/trend.md) and helps traders identify the strongest and most profitable trends to [trade](../t/trade.md). The ADX is often used in conjunction with +DI and -DI lines, which help measure [trend](../t/trend.md) direction.

### On-Balance Volume (OBV)

OBV is a [volume](../v/volume.md)-based [indicator](../i/indicator.md) that measures the buying and selling pressure. It adds [volume](../v/volume.md) on up days and subtracts [volume](../v/volume.md) on down days. The theory is that [volume](../v/volume.md) changes precede price changes, so OBV can provide insight into potential movements.

### Parabolic SAR

The [Parabolic SAR](../p/parabolic_sar.md) (Stop and Reverse) is a [trend](../t/trend.md)-following [indicator](../i/indicator.md) that identifies potential reversals in the [market](../m/market.md). When the price is above the SAR, the [trend](../t/trend.md) is considered bullish, and when below, it’s considered bearish.

### Ichimoku Cloud

The [Ichimoku Cloud](../i/ichimoku_cloud.md), or Ichimoku Kinko Hyo, is a comprehensive [indicator](../i/indicator.md) that defines [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md), [trend](../t/trend.md) direction, and [momentum](../m/momentum.md) all in one view. It consists of five lines, the most important being the "cloud" or Kumo, which projects future [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels.

### Commodity Channel Index (CCI)

The CCI is a versatile [indicator](../i/indicator.md) that can be used to identify a new [trend](../t/trend.md) or warning of extreme conditions. It measures the current [price level](../p/price_level.md) relative to an average [price level](../p/price_level.md) over a given period.

### Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)

VWAP provides the average price a [security](../s/security.md) has traded at throughout the day, based on both [volume](../v/volume.md) and price. It's commonly used by institutional traders to gauge trading [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md).

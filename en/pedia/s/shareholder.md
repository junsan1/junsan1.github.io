# Shareholder

A shareholder, also known as a stockholder, is an individual or institution that legally owns one or more [shares](../s/shares.md) in a public or private [corporation](../c/corporation.md). Shareholders are essentially the owners of the company and possess certain rights based on the type and amount of [shares](../s/shares.md) they [hold](../h/hold.md). They provide [capital](../c/capital.md) to the company and, in [return](../r/return.md), expect to earn a [return](../r/return.md) on their investment, which can come in various forms such as dividends, [capital](../c/capital.md) gains, or other forms of financial benefit. Understanding the role and rights of shareholders is crucial in the world of [finance](../f/finance.md) and [investing](../i/investing.md), as it helps in making informed decisions about investments and [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md).

## Types of Shareholders

1. **Individual Shareholders:**
   - **Retail Investors:** These are individual investors who buy [shares](../s/shares.md) for personal investment. They typically own a smaller number of [shares](../s/shares.md) compared to institutional investors.
   - **Employee Shareholders:** Employees of the company who receive [shares](../s/shares.md) as part of their compensation package. This can be through stock [options](../o/options.md) or employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs).

2. **Institutional Shareholders:**
   - **Mutual Funds:** Investment vehicles that pool funds from many investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of [stocks](../s/stock.md).
   - **Pension Funds:** Funds created by companies or public entities to provide retirement benefits to their employees. They invest in a variety of assets, including equities.
   - **[Hedge](../h/hedge.md) Funds:** Investment funds that employ various strategies to earn active returns for their investors.
   - **[Insurance](../i/insurance.md) Companies:** These institutions invest premiums collected from policyholders in various assets, including [stocks](../s/stock.md), to generate returns that help in paying out claims.

## Rights of Shareholders

1. **Voting Rights:** Shareholders usually have the right to vote on important matters, such as electing the board of directors, mergers and acquisitions, or any other major corporate changes. Common shareholders typically have one vote per share, while preferred shareholders may not have voting rights.
2. **Dividends:** Shareholders are entitled to a portion of the company's profits, distributed as dividends. The amount and frequency of dividends depend on the company's profitability and decision of the board of directors.
3. **Ownership in the Company:** Shareholders own a proportionate part of the company, depending on the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) they [hold](../h/hold.md). This ownership entitles them to a portion of the company's assets in case of [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md).
4. **[Capital](../c/capital.md) Gains:** Shareholders can benefit from the appreciation in the stock price, which results in [capital](../c/capital.md) gains when they sell their [shares](../s/shares.md) at a higher price than they paid.
5. **Pre-Emptive Rights:** In some cases, shareholders may have the right to purchase additional [shares](../s/shares.md) before the company offers them to the public, usually during new share issuances. This helps shareholders maintain their proportional ownership in the company.
6. **Access to Information:** Shareholders have the right to receive important financial information about the company, including annual reports, [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md), and other disclosures required by law.

## Responsibilities of Shareholders

1. **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Bearing:** Shareholders bear the [risk](../r/risk.md) of investment in the company. If the company performs poorly, shareholders may incur losses.
2. **Engagement in [Corporate Governance](../c/corporate_governance.md):** Shareholders have a responsibility to participate in the governance of the company by voting in shareholder meetings and engaging with company management.
3. **Ethical Investment:** Shareholders should consider the ethical implications of their investments, including the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices of the companies in which they invest.

## Influence of Shareholders in Corporate Governance

Shareholders play a critical role in the [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) of a company. They have the power to influence key decisions and [hold](../h/hold.md) the management accountable for their actions. This influence can manifest in several ways:

1. **Electing the Board of Directors:** Shareholders vote to elect members of the board of directors, who are responsible for overseeing the management and making strategic decisions.
2. **[Proxy](../p/proxy.md) Voting:** Institutional shareholders often use their [proxy](../p/proxy.md) voting power to influence corporate policies and practices. They may propose shareholder resolutions or vote on executive compensation packages, mergers, and other significant issues.
3. **Engagement and Activism:** Some shareholders, particularly institutional investors, actively engage with company management to promote changes in [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md), strategy, or operational practices. Shareholder activism can result in significant changes in company policies and practices.

## Challenges Faced by Shareholders

1. **Information Asymmetry:** Shareholders often depend on the information provided by the company's management to make informed decisions. However, this can lead to information asymmetry, where shareholders do not have access to all the relevant information, potentially leading to suboptimal decision-making.
2. **Diverse Interests:** Different groups of shareholders may have varying interests and objectives, which can lead to conflicts. For example, short-term investors may prioritize immediate returns, while long-term investors may focus on sustainable growth.
3. **Limited Regulatory Protection:** In some regions, regulatory frameworks may not provide adequate protection to minority shareholders, leaving them vulnerable to actions by the management or majority shareholders that may not be in their best [interest](../i/interest.md).

## Shareholder Agreements

Shareholder agreements are contracts between the shareholders of a company that outline their rights, responsibilities, and the relationship amongst them. These agreements are crucial in ensuring that the interests of all parties are protected and potential conflicts are managed efficiently. Key components of shareholder agreements include:

1. **Voting Arrangements:** Provisions for how shareholders [will](../w/will.md) vote on key issues, ensuring that decision-making processes are clear and agreed upon.
2. **[Dividend](../d/dividend.md) Policies:** Guidelines on how profits [will](../w/will.md) be distributed among shareholders, helping to manage expectations and prevent disputes over [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payments.
3. **Transfer of [Shares](../s/shares.md):** Rules regarding the transfer of [shares](../s/shares.md), including restrictions on selling to third parties or the process for existing shareholders to buy [shares](../s/shares.md) from departing shareholders.
4. **Dispute Resolution:** Mechanisms for resolving disputes among shareholders, such as mediation or [arbitration](../a/arbitration.md), to avoid prolonged legal battles that could harm the company.
5. **Exit Strategies:** Provisions for how shareholders can exit their investment, including [buyback](../b/buyback.md) [options](../o/options.md) or guidelines for selling [shares](../s/shares.md) in the [market](../m/market.md).

## Impact of Technological Advancements on Shareholding

Technological advancements have significantly impacted the way shareholders interact with companies and manage their investments. Some of these advancements include:

1. **Digital Trading Platforms:** The rise of online brokerage firms and trading platforms has made it easier for individuals to buy and sell [shares](../s/shares.md), providing greater accessibility and convenience.
2. **[Blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) and Digital Securities:** [Blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology offers the potential for more transparent and secure record-keeping of share ownership, reducing the [risk](../r/risk.md) of [fraud](../f/fraud.md) and errors. Digital securities, or [security](../s/security.md) tokens, represent [shares](../s/shares.md) on a [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md), enabling more efficient trading and settlement processes.
3. **[Artificial Intelligence](../a/artificial_intelligence_in_trading.md) and [Big Data](../b/big_data_in_trading.md):** AI and [big data analytics](../b/big_data_analytics_in_trading.md) provide investors with advanced tools to analyze [market](../m/market.md) trends, company performance, and make data-driven investment decisions.
4. **Robo-Advisors:** Automated investment platforms, known as robo-advisors, [offer](../o/offer.md) personalized investment advice and [portfolio management](../p/par.md) services at a lower cost than traditional financial advisors, making [investing](../i/investing.md) more accessible to a broader audience.

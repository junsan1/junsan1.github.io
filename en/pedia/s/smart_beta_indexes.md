### Smart Beta Indexes

[Smart Beta](../s/smart_beta.md) indexes, also known as alternative beta or strategic beta indexes, represent a modern approach to investing that blends aspects of traditional passive and active investment strategies. Unlike standard market-capitalization-weighted indexes, which assign weights to their constituent securities based purely on their market capitalization, [smart beta](../s/smart_beta.md) indexes use alternative weighting schemes and factor-based selection criteria to generate improved risk-adjusted returns. This indexing approach aims to capture investment factors or characteristics that can potentially enhance [portfolio performance](../p/portfolio_performance.md), such as low volatility, momentum, size, quality, and value.

### Key Concepts in Smart Beta Indexes

#### 1. Factors and Factor Investing

[Factor investing](../f/factor_investing.md) targets specific drivers of return. These drivers, or factors, are characteristics shared by securities that have been shown to collectively affect their returns. Common factors used in [smart beta](../s/smart_beta.md) strategies include:

- **Volatility**: Stocks with lower price volatility tend to outperform high volatility stocks on a risk-adjusted basis.
- **Momentum**: Stocks that have recently outperformed tend to continue to perform well in the short term.
- **Size**: Smaller companies often provide higher returns compared to larger companies.
- **Quality**: Companies with strong financial health metrics like high return on equity, low debt, or stable earnings tend to perform well.
- **Value**: Stocks that appear cheaper relative to fundamentals (e.g., low price-to-earnings or price-to-book ratios) often outperform more expensive stocks.

#### 2. Construction and Methodology

[Smart beta](../s/smart_beta.md) [index construction](../i/index_construction.md) typically involves the following steps:

- **Selection**: Identify and select securities based on specific factors or criteria.
- **Weighting**: Apply alternative weighting schemes (e.g., equal weighting, factor weighting) rather than traditional market-cap weighting.
- **Rebalancing**: Periodically rebalance the index to maintain desired factor exposures and weightings.

For example, a [smart beta](../s/smart_beta.md) index focusing on the [value factor](../v/value_factor.md) might select stocks with low price-to-earnings ratios and weight them based on their value scores rather than market cap.

#### 3. Advantages and Challenges

##### Advantages

- **Enhanced Returns**: By focusing on specific factors, [smart beta](../s/smart_beta.md) strategies can potentially deliver higher returns relative to traditional market-cap-weighted strategies.
- **Diversification**: Alternative weighting and factor-based selection can offer better [diversification benefits](../d/diversification_benefits.md).
- **Transparency**: Many [smart beta](../s/smart_beta.md) indexes follow transparent, rule-based methodologies.

##### Challenges

- **Complexity**: Strategy development and factor selection require considerable expertise and research.
- **Short-term Underperformance**: Factors can underperform in the short term, leading to volatility in returns.
- **Implementation Costs**: Trading expenses and turnover associated with frequent rebalancing can erode returns.

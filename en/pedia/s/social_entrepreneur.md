# Social Entrepreneur

A social [entrepreneur](../e/entrepreneur.md) is a person who pursues innovative solutions to social problems. By leveraging [market](../m/market.md) principles and sound [business](../b/business.md) practices, social entrepreneurs create products and services that address societal needs. Unlike traditional entrepreneurs who primarily focus on [profit](../p/profit.md) maximization, social entrepreneurs prioritize social impact and change. This distinction fundamentally shapes their mission, strategies, and [business models](../b/business_models.md).

## Characteristics of Social Entrepreneurs

### Innovativeness
Social entrepreneurs are marked by their ability to think outside traditional frameworks. This means identifying problems and [gaps](../g/gap.md) that have been either neglected or inadequately addressed and coming up with novel solutions.

### Social Impact
The core of social entrepreneurship is its commitment to social improvement. Social entrepreneurs aim to tackle societal issues like [poverty](../p/poverty.md), health, education, and the environment. Their ventures are driven by a mission to create a positive difference, often measuring success in terms of social impact rather than financial [gain](../g/gain.md).

### Financial Sustainability
While social impact is the primary goal, social entrepreneurs recognize the importance of financial sustainability in achieving and maintaining long-term social change. They seek to create [business models](../b/business_models.md) that are not only impactful but also economically viable.

### Ethical Leadership
Social entrepreneurs often embody strong ethical principles. They aim to lead their ventures with integrity, [transparency](../t/transparency.md), and accountability. This ethical focus helps build [trust](../t/trust.md) and engage a broader community committed to the cause.

## Types of Social Enterprises

### Non-Profit Organizations
Non-profits reinvest any [surplus](../s/surplus.md) revenues back into the organization to further its mission. Example: Teach For America, a non-[profit](../p/profit.md) that places recent college graduates in teaching positions to address educational inequality in the United States.

### For-Profit Social Enterprises
These ventures aim to achieve social goals through [business](../b/business.md) operations while also generating [profit](../p/profit.md). Example: TOMS Shoes, which operates on a "one for one" model, donating a pair of shoes to a child in need for every pair sold.

### Hybrid Models
These organizations blend characteristics of both non-profits and for-profits. Example: Grameen [Bank](../b/bank.md), a [microfinance](../m/microfinance.md) organization that provides small loans to the impoverished without requiring [collateral](../c/collateral.md), combines the social mission of empowerment with a [business](../b/business.md) model that ensures financial sustainability.

## Impact Measurement

### Social Return on Investment (SROI)
SROI is a key metric used to measure the [value](../v/value.md) generated by social enterprises. It involves calculating the social, environmental, and economic outcomes and comparing them to the investment required.

### Triple Bottom Line (TBL)
TBL is a framework that evaluates a company’s commitment to social and environmental responsibilities alongside its [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md). It focuses on three P's: People, Planet, and [Profit](../p/profit.md).

### Beneficiary Feedback
Directly obtaining feedback from the beneficiaries of the [social enterprise](../s/social_enterprise.md)’s work ensures that the solutions provided are effective and relevant. This feedback loop is critical for continuous improvement and impact assessment.

## Funding Options

### Grants
[Grant](../g/grant.md) funding from governments, private foundations, and international organizations is a common source for non-[profit](../p/profit.md) social enterprises.

### Venture Philanthropy
This approach involves providing both financial and strategic support to social enterprises, much like venture capitalists do for start-ups. Example: Omidyar Network, which invests in and supports social organizations.

### Crowdfunding
[Crowdfunding](../c/crowdfunding.md) platforms enable social entrepreneurs to raise small amounts of [money](../m/money.md) from a large number of people. Example: Kickstarter and Indiegogo.

### Impact Investing
Impact investors seek financial returns alongside social or environmental benefits. Their investments are aimed at generating measurable social impact. Example: Acumen, which invests in companies and initiatives that address [poverty](../p/poverty.md) and social injustice.

## Challenges Faced by Social Entrepreneurs

### Scalability
Scaling a [social enterprise](../s/social_enterprise.md) to maximize its impact while maintaining financial sustainability is a significant challenge.

### Measurement of Impact
Quantifying social impact can be difficult due to the qualitative nature of social change and the varied metrics involved.

### Funding
Securing consistent and adequate funding is often a hurdle for social enterprises, particularly those that rely on grants or donations.

### Balancing Dual Objectives
Navigating the balance between maintaining profitability and achieving social impact requires skill and strategic alignment.

## Notable Social Entrepreneurs

### Muhammad Yunus
Founder of Grameen [Bank](../b/bank.md), Yunus pioneered the concept of [microcredit](../m/microcredit.md) and [microfinance](../m/microfinance.md), providing small loans to the poor without requiring [collateral](../c/collateral.md) to help them achieve financial independence.

### Blake Mycoskie
Founder of TOMS Shoes, Mycoskie introduced the "One for One" [business](../b/business.md) model, where the company donates a pair of shoes for every pair sold, addressing issues of [poverty](../p/poverty.md) and access to essential goods.

### Jessica Jackley
Co-Founder of Kiva, a platform that allows people to lend [money](../m/money.md) to low-[income](../i/income.md) entrepreneurs and students over the Internet, promoting entrepreneurship and reducing [poverty](../p/poverty.md).

## Conclusion

Social entrepreneurs play a crucial role in addressing some of the world’s most pressing challenges. By combining [business](../b/business.md) acumen with a commitment to social and environmental well-being, they innovate sustainable solutions that make a lasting impact. Balancing [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) with social good requires savvy, resilience, and a deep understanding of both [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md) and societal needs. As the field of social entrepreneurship continues to grow, these changemakers prove that it is possible to do well by doing good.

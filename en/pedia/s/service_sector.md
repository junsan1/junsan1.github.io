# Service Sector

The service sector, also known as the tertiary sector, is one of the three primary economic sectors, the others being the primary sector (extractive industries) and the secondary sector ([manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md)). The service sector encompasses a wide [range](../r/range.md) of industries that provide intangible goods and services to consumers and businesses. This includes industries such as [finance](../f/finance.md), [insurance](../i/insurance.md), [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), healthcare, education, retail, hospitality, entertainment, and information technology services, among others. 

The service sector is a significant contributor to the gross domestic product (GDP) of many countries, often surpassing the primary and secondary sectors in terms of economic impact. It is characterized by the production of services rather than goods, which are consumed at the point of [sale](../s/sale.md). The growth and development of the service sector are pivotal in modern economies, with many advanced and emerging economies showing a dominant [trend](../t/trend.md) towards service-oriented activities.

## Characteristics of the Service Sector

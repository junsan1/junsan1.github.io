# Stockbroker

A stockbroker, also known as an investment [broker](../b/broker.md) or securities [broker](../b/broker.md), is a professional individual or [firm](../f/firm.md) that buys and sells [stocks](../s/stock.md) and other securities on behalf of clients. Stockbrokers serve as intermediaries between buyers and sellers, facilitating transactions in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). They are equipped with the knowledge and tools to execute trades, provide financial advice, and help clients make informed investment decisions. A stockbroker typically earns a [commission](../c/commission.md) for their services, which could be a flat [fee](../f/fee.md) or a percentage of the [transaction](../t/transaction.md) [value](../v/value.md).

## Types of Stockbrokers

### Full-Service Brokers

Full-service brokers [offer](../o/offer.md) personalized investment advice, [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md), and a wide [range](../r/range.md) of financial products and services. They typically charge higher fees compared to [discount](../d/discount.md) brokers. Examples of full-service brokerage firms include:

- **[Merrill Lynch](../m/merrill_lynch.md)**: [Merrill Lynch](https://www.ml.com)

### Discount Brokers

[Discount](../d/discount.md) brokers execute trades on behalf of clients at reduced [commission](../c/commission.md) rates, often without providing personalized investment advice.

## Regulatory Framework

Stockbrokers are subject to stringent regulatory oversight to ensure the integrity and stability of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). In the United States, the main regulatory bodies include:

- **Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC)**: The SEC oversees the securities [industry](../i/industry.md), including stock exchanges, brokerage firms, and investment advisors. The SEC aims to protect investors and maintain fair and efficient markets.
- **Financial [Industry](../i/industry.md) Regulatory Authority (FINRA)**: FINRA is a self-regulatory organization that supervises brokerage firms and their registered representatives. It enforces rules, registers brokers, and ensures compliance with securities laws and regulations.

## Licensing and Qualifications

To become a licensed stockbroker, individuals must pass specific exams and meet regulatory requirements. Common exams include:

- **[Series 7](../s/series_7.md) Exam**: Administered by FINRA, the [Series 7](../s/series_7.md) General Securities Representative Exam evaluates a candidate's knowledge of securities and investments. Passing the [Series 7](../s/series_7.md) allows individuals to sell a wide [range](../r/range.md) of securities.
- **[Series 63](../s/series_63.md) Exam**: This exam, also administered by FINRA, tests knowledge of state securities regulations and is required for brokers to operate in many states.

In addition to passing exams, aspiring stockbrokers must typically undergo background checks, meet the minimum age requirement, and maintain continuing education to stay informed about [industry](../i/industry.md) developments and regulatory changes.

## Role and Responsibilities

### Research and Analysis

Stockbrokers conduct extensive research and analysis to identify investment opportunities and assess [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

They help clients build diversified portfolios, develop investment strategies, and make informed decisions about buying and selling securities.

### Regulatory Compliance

Stockbrokers must adhere to strict regulatory requirements to ensure the integrity of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). They are responsible for maintaining accurate records, reporting transactions, and complying with anti-[fraud](../f/fraud.md) and anti-[money laundering](../m/money_laundering.md) regulations.

### Portfolio Management

Some stockbrokers, particularly those at full-service firms, [offer](../o/offer.md) [portfolio management](../p/par.md) services. They create and manage investment portfolios on behalf of clients, adjusting [asset](../a/asset.md) allocations based on [market](../m/market.md) conditions and clients' objectives.

## Tools and Technology

Advancements in technology have significantly transformed the role of stockbrokers, enabling them to provide faster and more efficient services. Key technological tools used by stockbrokers include:

### Trading Platforms

Online trading platforms allow stockbrokers and clients to execute trades, monitor [market](../m/market.md) activity, and access real-time data. These platforms provide various features, such as advanced charting, [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) tools.

### Research Tools

## Ethical Considerations

Stockbrokers are expected to adhere to high [ethical standards](../e/ethical_standards_in_trading.md) to maintain [trust](../t/trust.md) and integrity in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). Key ethical considerations include:

## Challenges and Opportunities

### Market Volatility

[Market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) poses a challenge for stockbrokers as it can lead to significant fluctuations in [asset](../a/asset.md) prices and [investor](../i/investor.md) sentiment.

### Regulatory Changes

Evolving regulatory requirements can impact stockbrokers' operations and compliance [obligations](../o/obligation.md). Brokers must stay informed about regulatory changes and adapt their practices to ensure compliance.

### Increased Competition

The rise of [discount](../d/discount.md) brokers and robo-advisors has intensified competition in the brokerage [industry](../i/industry.md). Stockbrokers must differentiate themselves by [offering](../o/offering.md) [value](../v/value.md)-added services and building strong client relationships.

### Expanding Global Markets

[Globalization](../g/globalization.md) has expanded investment opportunities, allowing stockbrokers to access international markets and diversify clients' portfolios.

# Sector ETFs Analysis

## Introduction to Sector ETFs

[Sector ETFs](../s/sector_etfs.md) ([Exchange](../e/exchange.md)-Traded Funds) are financial products that allow investors to [gain](../g/gain.md) exposure to specific sectors of the [economy](../e/economy.md) through a single [investment vehicle](../i/investment_vehicle.md).

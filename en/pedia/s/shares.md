# Shares

Shares, also known as [stocks](../s/stock.md) or [equity](../e/equity.md), represent units of ownership in a [corporation](../c/corporation.md) or [financial asset](../f/financial_asset.md). When you purchase shares in a company, you are effectively buying a piece of that company. This ownership entitles you to a portion of the company's profits and assets. Additionally, as a [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md), you may have the right to vote on certain company matters, such as electing the board of directors, and major corporate policies.

## Types of Shares

There are several types of shares that investors might encounter:

### Common Shares

Common shares are the most usual type of share available to investors and represent [equity](../e/equity.md) ownership in a [corporation](../c/corporation.md). Common shareholders are entitled to dividends and have voting rights. However, in the event of [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md), common shareholders have the lowest priority in [asset](../a/asset.md) [distribution](../d/distribution.md).

### Preferred Shares

Preferred shares are a type of [equity](../e/equity.md) that provides certain privileges over common shares, such as a fixed [dividend](../d/dividend.md) and priority in [asset](../a/asset.md) [distribution](../d/distribution.md) upon [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md). Preferred shareholders generally do not have voting rights.

### Convertible Shares

Convertible shares are a hybrid type of [equity](../e/equity.md) that can be converted into a pre-determined number of common shares at specific times and under certain conditions. This feature provides additional flexibility and potential for [capital](../c/capital.md) appreciation.

### Treasury Shares

Treasury shares are previously outstanding shares that have been repurchased by the issuing company. These shares do not confer [dividend](../d/dividend.md) rights or voting privileges.

## Share Classes

Some corporations [issue](../i/issue.md) [multiple](../m/multiple.md) classes of shares, each with different rights and privileges. For example, a company might [issue](../i/issue.md) Class A shares with one vote per share and Class B shares with ten votes per share. This structure allows original founders and key stakeholders to retain control over corporate decisions.

## Valuation of Shares

### Market Value

The [market value](../m/market_value.md) of a share is determined by [supply](../s/supply.md) and [demand](../d/demand.md) dynamics in the [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md). Factors influencing [market value](../m/market_value.md) include company performance, [industry](../i/industry.md) conditions, and overall [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md).

### Book Value

[Book value](../b/book_value.md) represents the net [asset](../a/asset.md) [value](../v/value.md) of a company as reported on its [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md). It is calculated as the company's total assets minus its [total liabilities](../t/total_liabilities.md), divided by the number of outstanding shares.

### Intrinsic Value

[Intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) estimates the "true" [value](../v/value.md) of a share based on fundamental [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md). This involves evaluating the companyâ€™s [earnings](../e/earnings.md), [revenue](../r/revenue.md), growth prospects, and [risk](../r/risk.md). Techniques such as discounted [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) (DCF) are often employed to determine [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md).

## Dividends

Dividends are payments made by a [corporation](../c/corporation.md) to its shareholders, usually derived from profits. Dividends can be paid in cash or additional shares. The decision to pay dividends, and the amount, is generally determined by the company's board of directors.

### Dividend Yield

[Dividend yield](../d/dividend_yield.md) is a financial ratio that indicates how much a company pays out in dividends relative to its share price. It is calculated as:

\[ \text{[Dividend Yield](../d/dividend_yield.md)} = \frac{\text{Annual Dividends per Share}}{\text{Price per Share}} \]

## Rights of Shareholders

### Voting Rights

Common shareholders usually have the right to vote on key corporate matters, such as the election of directors and major corporate policies. Voting can occur via [proxy](../p/proxy.md) or during the annual general meeting (AGM).

### Dividend Rights

Shareholders have the right to receive dividends as declared by the board. However, dividends are not guaranteed and may be suspended if the company faces financial difficulties.

### Right to Inspect Books and Records

Shareholders may have the legal right to inspect certain corporate documents and records to ensure [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and accountability.

### Preemptive Rights

In some jurisdictions, shareholders may have [preemptive rights](../p/preemptive_rights.md), which allow them to purchase new shares before they are offered to the public in a [new issue](../n/new_issue.md). This enables shareholders to maintain their proportional ownership in the company.

## Risks of Holding Shares

### Market Risk

The [value](../v/value.md) of shares can be highly volatile, fluctuating based on [market](../m/market.md) conditions. This [risk](../r/risk.md) is inherent to all [equity](../e/equity.md) investments.

### Liquidity Risk

While shares of larger, well-established companies are usually highly [liquid](../l/liquid.md), smaller companies may face [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) issues, making it difficult to buy or sell shares without affecting the [market price](../m/market_price.md).

### Company Risk

Individual company [risk](../r/risk.md) refers to the possibility that a particular company may [underperform](../u/underperform.md) or [fail](../f/fail.md) altogether due to poor management, competitive pressures, or other factors.

### Dividend Risk

Not all companies pay dividends, and those that do might reduce or eliminate [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payments in response to economic downturns or operational challenges.

## Corporate Actions Affecting Shares

### Stock Splits

In a [stock split](../s/stock_split.md), a [corporation](../c/corporation.md) divides its existing shares into [multiple](../m/multiple.md) shares to lower the share price and increase [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md). For example, in a 2-for-1 split, each [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) receives an additional share for every share they own, and the share price is halved.

### Reverse Stock Splits

A [reverse stock split](../r/reverse_stock_split.md) consolidates the number of existing shares, increasing the share price. For example, in a 1-for-2 reverse split, shareholders receive one share for every two they own, and the share price doubles.

### Rights Issues

Rights issues allow existing shareholders to purchase additional shares at a discounted price, usually to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) for the company. This offers the opportunity to buy new shares before they are offered to the public.

### Buybacks

[Share buybacks](../s/share_buybacks.md) occur when a company repurchases its own shares from the [market](../m/market.md), reducing the total number of outstanding shares and potentially raising the share price.

## Investing in Shares

### Fundamental Analysis

[Fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md) involves evaluating a company's [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md), management, competitive advantages, and markets to determine its [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md). This analysis aims to identify [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) that are likely to appreciate over time.

### Technical Analysis

[Technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) uses historical price and [volume](../v/volume.md) data to predict future price movements. Traders employing this method utilize charts and various indicators like moving averages, [relative strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [index](../i/index.md) (RSI), and MACD.

### Quantitative Analysis

[Quantitative analysis](../q/quantitative_analysis.md) involves the use of [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md) and statistical techniques to analyze financial data. It is particularly useful for [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), where automated systems execute trades based on pre-defined criteria.

## Shareholders vs. Bondholders

Unlike shareholders, bondholders are creditors to the company and do not have ownership rights. Bondholders receive regular [interest](../i/interest.md) payments and have priority over shareholders in [asset](../a/asset.md) [distribution](../d/distribution.md) upon [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md). The key differences include:

- **Ownership**: Shareholders own part of the company; bondholders do not.
- **[Risk](../r/risk.md)**: Shares are riskier than bonds but [offer](../o/offer.md) potentially higher returns.
- **[Income](../i/income.md)**: Shareholders receive dividends, while bondholders receive [interest](../i/interest.md) payments.
- **Voting Rights**: Only shareholders generally have voting rights.

## Regulatory Aspects

### Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)

In the United States, the SEC regulates securities markets to protect investors. Companies must adhere to SEC rules regarding disclosures, reporting, and other regulatory requirements.

### Sarbanes-Oxley Act

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act was enacted to enhance [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) and financial [transparency](../t/transparency.md). It mandates rigorous [internal controls](../i/internal_controls.md) and regular audits to prevent [fraud](../f/fraud.md).

### International Regulations

Different countries have their regulatory bodies overseeing securities markets. For instance:
- **Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)** in the UK
- **European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA)** in the EU
- **Securities and [Futures](../f/futures.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SFC)** in Hong Kong

### Insider Trading

[Insider trading](../i/insider.md) involves buying or selling shares based on material, non-public information. It is illegal and subject to severe penalties.

## Innovations Impacting Shares

### Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) utilizes complex algorithms to execute trades at high speeds and volumes. These systems can analyze [multiple](../m/multiple.md) indicators and execute trades more efficiently than human traders.

### Blockchain and Tokenization

[Blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology enables the tokenization of assets, including shares. This can increase [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and reduce settlement times. Tokenized shares can be traded on [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) platforms, [offering](../o/offering.md) more [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and fractional ownership opportunities.

### Robo-Advisors

Robo-advisors provide automated, algorithm-driven [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md) services with minimal human intervention. They [offer](../o/offer.md) [investment management](../i/investment_management.md) strategies, including share investments, based on individual [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) and financial goals.

### High-Frequency Trading (HFT)

High-frequency trading employs algorithms to execute thousands of trades per second. It aims to [profit](../p/profit.md) from small price discrepancies and requires substantial computational power and low-latency connections to trading exchanges.

### Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Investing

[ESG investing](../e/esg_investing.md) considers a company's environmental impact, social responsibilities, and governance practices. Investors increasingly favor ESG-compliant companies, influencing share valuations and corporate behavior.

### FinTech Platforms

FinTech platforms like [Robinhood](../r/robinhood.md) and [E*TRADE](../e/e_trade.md) have democratized access to share markets, allowing retail investors to [trade](../t/trade.md) with minimal fees. These platforms often provide real-time data, educational resources, and [social trading](../s/social_trading.md) features.

## Conclusion

Shares represent a critical component of modern [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), [offering](../o/offering.md) a pathway for individuals to own a part of corporations and [profit](../p/profit.md) from their growth. Understanding the various types of shares, their [valuation](../v/valuation.md), [investor](../i/investor.md) rights, and risks is essential for making informed investment decisions. As technology evolves, innovations like [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology, and FinTech platforms [will](../w/will.md) continue to reshape the landscape, making share [investing](../i/investing.md) more accessible and efficient.

## Simple Moving Average Strategies

### Introduction
[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), or "algotrading," leverages computer algorithms to conduct trades based on pre-defined criteria. Among the various strategies employed in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), Simple Moving Average (SMA) strategies remain some of the most popular due to their simplicity and reliability. SMA strategies involve calculating the average of an asset's price over a specified number of periods to smooth out price data and identify trends. This article delves deep into the various SMA strategies, their implementation, and their advantages and drawbacks.

### What is a Simple Moving Average (SMA)?
A Simple Moving Average is a statistical calculation that takes the average closing price of a security over a specific number of periods. The moving average gets its name because it slides, or moves, across the chart as new prices are added and old prices are removed.

#### Formula for SMA
The formula for calculating the SMA is straightforward:
\[ SMA = \frac{P1 + P2 + P3 + \ldots + Pn}{n} \]
Where:
- \( P \) represents the price of the asset at each time period.
- \( n \) is the number of periods over which the average is calculated.

For example, a [5-day SMA](../1/5-day_sma.md) of a stock would be the average of the closing prices of the last 5 days.

### Types of SMA Strategies
Simple Moving Averages provide a wide variety of [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). Here, we will cover some of the most commonly used ones:

1. **Single SMA Crossover Strategy**
2. **Dual SMA Crossover Strategy**
3. **Triple SMA Crossover Strategy**
4. **Dynamic SMA Strategy**

#### Single SMA Crossover Strategy
This is a straightforward strategy where traders use a single SMA to make trading decisions. Typically, this involves using a longer-term SMA as a trend identifier. The rules are:
- **Buy Signal**: When the price crosses above the SMA, it indicates a potential upward trend.
- **Sell Signal**: When the price crosses below the SMA, it signifies a potential downward trend.

##### Implementation Example
```python
# Single SMA Crossover Strategy Implementation
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Sample data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Close': [10, 10.5, 11, 11.5, 11, 10.5, 10, 9.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 10.5, 11, 11.5, 12]
})

data['SMA_5'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=5).mean()
data['Signal'] = 0
data['Signal'][5:] = np.where(data['Close'][5:] > data['SMA_5'][5:], 1, 0)
data['Position'] = data['Signal'].diff()

print(data)
```

#### Dual SMA Crossover Strategy
This strategy employs two SMAs with different time periods. Traders use a short-term SMA and a long-term SMA to generate buy and sell signals. The rules are:
- **Buy Signal**: When the short-term SMA crosses above the long-term SMA, indicating an upward trend.
- **Sell Signal**: When the short-term SMA crosses below the long-term SMA, indicating a downward trend.

##### Implementation Example
```python
# Dual SMA Crossover Strategy Implementation
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Sample data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Close': [10, 10.5, 11, 11.5, 11, 10.5, 10, 9.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 10.5, 11, 11.5, 12]
})

data['SMA_5'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=5).mean()
data['SMA_10'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=10).mean()
data['Signal'] = 0
data['Signal'][10:] = np.where(data['SMA_5'][10:] > data['SMA_10'][10:], 1, 0)
data['Position'] = data['Signal'].diff()

print(data)
```

#### Triple SMA Crossover Strategy
This strategy utilizes three SMAs of different time periods to generate signals. The rules are more complex and involve hierarchical conditions:
- **Buy Signal**: Generated when all three SMAs are in an upward alignment (short-term above medium-term, and medium-term above long-term).
- **Sell Signal**: Generated when all three SMAs are in a downward alignment (short-term below medium-term, and medium-term below long-term).

##### Implementation Example
```python
# Triple SMA Crossover Strategy Implementation
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Sample data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Close': [10, 10.5, 11, 11.5, 11, 10.5, 10, 9.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 10.5, 11, 11.5, 12]
})

data['SMA_5'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=5).mean()
data['SMA_10'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=10).mean()
data['SMA_20'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()
data['Signal'] = 0
data['Signal'][20:] = np.where((data['SMA_5'][20:] > data['SMA_10'][20:]) &
                               (data['SMA_10'][20:] > data['SMA_20'][20:]), 1, 0)
data['Position'] = data['Signal'].diff()

print(data)
```

#### Dynamic SMA Strategy
Unlike static SMA crossover strategies, a Dynamic SMA strategy adjusts the SMA period based on market conditions. Traders may use volatility measures like the Average True Range (ATR) to modify the period. The rationale is that during high volatility, a longer SMA period smooths out noise, and during low volatility, a shorter SMA period provides more responsiveness.

##### Implementation Example
```python
# Dynamic SMA Strategy Implementation
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Sample data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Close': [10, 10.5, 11, 11.5, 11, 10.5, 10, 9.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 10.5, 11, 11.5, 12],
    'High': [10.2, 10.7, 11.2, 11.7, 11.2, 10.7, 10.2, 9.7, 9.2, 9.7, 10.2, 10.7, 11.2, 11.7, 12.2],
    'Low': [9.8, 10.3, 10.8, 11.3, 10.8, 10.3, 9.8, 9.3, 8.8, 9.3, 9.8, 10.3, 10.8, 11.3, 11.8]
})

data['ATR'] = data['High'].rolling(window=5).max() - data['Low'].rolling(window=5).min()
data['Dynamic_SMA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=(5 + data['ATR'].shift(1) / 2)).mean()
data['Signal'] = 0
data['Signal'][5:] = np.where(data['Close'][5:] > data['Dynamic_SMA'][5:], 1, 0)
data['Position'] = data['Signal'].diff()

print(data)
```

### Advantages of SMA Strategies
1. **Simplicity**: SMA strategies are easy to understand and implement, making them suitable for beginners.
2. **Trend Identification**: SMAs help in identifying the direction of the trend.
3. **Versatility**: Applicable across various time frames and asset classes.

### Drawbacks of SMA Strategies
1. **Lagging Indicator**: SMAs are based on historical prices and may lag in fast-moving markets.
2. **Whipsaws**: Frequent changes in trend direction can lead to false signals, resulting in losses.
3. **Parameter Sensitivity**: The choice of period length can greatly affect performance, requiring optimization.

# Security Market Line (SML)

The [Security](../s/security.md) [Market](../m/market.md) Line (SML) is a graphical representation used in the [Capital Asset](../c/capital_asset.md) Pricing Model (CAPM) to illustrate the expected returns of various assets or portfolios based on their [systemic risk](../s/systemic_risk.md), as measured by [beta](../b/beta.md) (Î²). The SML is a pivotal concept in modern portfolio theory and plays a crucial role in [finance](../f/finance.md), particularly in [investment analysis](../i/investment_analysis.md) and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md).

### Definition of Security Market Line (SML)

The [Security](../s/security.md) [Market](../m/market.md) Line is a plot of the expected returns of assets as a function of their [beta](../b/beta.md) coefficients, which measure each [asset](../a/asset.md)'s [volatility](../v/volatility.md) relative to the [market](../m/market.md). The equation for the SML is based on the CAPM formula:

\[ E(R_i) = R_f + \beta_i (E(R_m) - R_f) \]

Where:
- \( E(R_i) \) is the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) of the [asset](../a/asset.md).
- \( R_f \) is the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate.
- \( \beta_i \) is the [beta](../b/beta.md) of the [asset](../a/asset.md).
- \( E(R_m) \) is the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) of the [market](../m/market.md).

### Characteristics of the Security Market Line

1. **Slope and Position**: 
    - The SML has a positive slope reflecting the [risk-return tradeoff](../r/risk-return_tradeoff.md); assets with higher [risk](../r/risk.md) (higher [beta](../b/beta.md)) are expected to [offer](../o/offer.md) higher returns to compensate investors for taking on more [risk](../r/risk.md).
    - The position of the SML changes with the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate and the expected [market](../m/market.md) [return](../r/return.md). An increase in either the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate or the [market](../m/market.md) [return](../r/return.md) shifts the SML upwards, implying higher returns for given levels of [beta](../b/beta.md).

2. **[Risk](../r/risk.md)-Free Rate Intercept**: 
    - The SML intersects the y-axis at the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate (\( R_f \)). This point represents a theoretical investment with zero [systemic risk](../s/systemic_risk.md), typically short-term government securities like [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) bills.

3. **[Market Portfolio](../m/market_portfolio.md)**:
    - The [market portfolio](../m/market_portfolio.md), denoted typically by the broader stock [market index](../m/market_index.md), has a [beta](../b/beta.md) (\( \[beta](../b/beta.md) \)) of 1.0. On the SML, it is plotted at the point \((\[beta](../b/beta.md) = 1, E(R_m))\).

4. **[Efficient Market Hypothesis](../e/efficient_market_hypothesis.md)**:
    - The SML is underpinned by the [Efficient Market Hypothesis](../e/efficient_market_hypothesis.md) (EMH), which asserts that [asset](../a/asset.md) prices fully reflect all available information. Hence, in an efficient [market](../m/market.md), assets should lie on the SML.

5. **Systematic vs. [Unsystematic Risk](../u/unsystematic_risk.md)**:
    - The SML only accounts for systemic ([market](../m/market.md)) [risk](../r/risk.md), not unsystematic (diversifiable) [risk](../r/risk.md). According to CAPM, [unsystematic risk](../u/unsystematic_risk.md) can be mitigated through [diversification](../d/diversification.md), so investors should not expect compensation for these risks.

6. **Comparison with the [Capital](../c/capital.md) [Market](../m/market.md) Line (CML)**:
    - While the [Capital](../c/capital.md) [Market](../m/market.md) Line (CML) represents portfolios combining the [risk-free asset](../r/risk-free_asset.md) with the [market portfolio](../m/market_portfolio.md), the SML applies to individual securities irrespective of their combinations with the [risk-free asset](../r/risk-free_asset.md).

### Applications of the Security Market Line

**1. Performance Evaluation**:
    - **[Jensen's Alpha](../j/jensen's_alpha.md)**: Investors and analysts often use the SML to evaluate investment performance. [Jensen's Alpha](../j/jensen's_alpha.md), a measure of [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted performance, is derived from the CAPM equation and indicates whether an [asset](../a/asset.md) has outperformed or underperformed the [market](../m/market.md), given its [beta](../b/beta.md).

    \[ \alpha_i = E(R_i) - [R_f + \beta_i (E(R_m) - R_f)] \]

    A positive [alpha](../a/alpha.md) suggests outperformance, while a negative [alpha](../a/alpha.md) indicates underperformance.

**2. Pricing of Assets**:
    - If an [asset](../a/asset.md) lies above the SML, it is considered [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) as it offers higher returns for its level of [systemic risk](../s/systemic_risk.md). Conversely, assets below the SML are considered [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md).

**3. Portfolio Construction**:
    - Financial managers and analysts employ the SML for constructing diversified portfolios that align with desired [risk](../r/risk.md)-[return](../r/return.md) profiles. By analyzing the [beta](../b/beta.md) and positioning relative to the SML, they can make informed decisions to achieve optimal [diversification](../d/diversification.md) and [risk](../r/risk.md) allocation.

### Advantages of the Security Market Line

- **Simplicity and Intuition**:
    - The SML offers a straightforward, intuitive way to understand the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) for a given level of [systematic risk](../s/systematic_risk.md), underscoring the tradeoff between [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md).

- **Benchmarking**:
    - The SML serves as a crucial [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for evaluating performance and [asset](../a/asset.md) pricing, facilitating comparability across various investments.

### Limitations and Criticisms

1. **Assumptions of CAPM**:
    - The SML is rooted in the assumptions of the CAPM, including assumptions about [investor](../i/investor.md) behavior, [market](../m/market.md) conditions, and [risk](../r/risk.md). In practice, the real-world deviations from these assumptions can limit the reliability of the SML.

2. **Emerging Markets and Anomalies**:
    - In less efficient or emerging markets, the assumptions [underlying](../u/underlying.md) the SML might not [hold](../h/hold.md), leading to significant deviations and rendering it less applicable.

3. **Single [Factor](../f/factor.md) Model**:
    - CAPM and the SML rely on a single [factor](../f/factor.md) ([market risk](../m/market_risk.md)) to explain [asset](../a/asset.md) returns. Some financial models and theories, like the [Arbitrage Pricing Theory](../a/arbitrage_pricing_theory.md) (APT) or [multi-factor models](../m/multi-factor_models.md), argue that [multiple](../m/multiple.md) factors influence [asset](../a/asset.md) returns, questioning the SML's comprehensiveness.

### Conclusion

The [Security](../s/security.md) [Market](../m/market.md) Line remains an integral part of modern [finance](../f/finance.md) and investment theory, providing valuable insights into the relationship between [risk](../r/risk.md) and [expected return](../e/expected_return.md). Despite its limitations and the evolution of alternative models, the SML's simplicity, intuitive representation, and [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) capabilities ensure it continues to be widely used by investors, analysts, and academics.

Understanding the SML helps investors better grasp the dynamics of [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md), aiding in more informed decision-making, effective [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), and performance assessment. Whether used independently or alongside other models, the [Security](../s/security.md) [Market](../m/market.md) Line is a foundational tool in the arsenal of [finance](../f/finance.md) professionals.

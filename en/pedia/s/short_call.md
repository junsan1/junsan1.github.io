# Short Call

A short call, also known as [call option](../c/call_option.md) writing, is a strategy employed in option trading where the [trader](../t/trader.md) sells or "writes" a [call option](../c/call_option.md). This strategy is typically utilized when the [trader](../t/trader.md) believes that the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) [will](../w/will.md) remain stable or decrease. In this detailed exposition, we [will](../w/will.md) delve into the mechanics, applications, risks, and strategic use of short calls in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

## Mechanics of a Short Call

### Definition

A short call involves selling a [call option](../c/call_option.md) contract to a buyer for a [premium](../p/premium.md). The seller, or the [writer](../w/writer.md), of the [call option](../c/call_option.md) is obligated to sell the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) if the buyer exercises the option by the [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md).

### Components

A [call option](../c/call_option.md) has several critical components that traders must understand:

- **[Strike Price](../s/strike_price.md)**: The price at which the [call option](../c/call_option.md) can be exercised.
- **[Premium](../p/premium.md)**: The price paid by the buyer to the seller for the option.
- **[Expiration Date](../e/expiration_date.md)**: The date by which the option must be exercised.
- **[Underlying Asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)**: The [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) (e.g., stock, [commodity](../c/commodity.md)) on which the [call option](../c/call_option.md) is based.

### Short Call Example

Suppose a [trader](../t/trader.md) writes a [call option](../c/call_option.md) on ABC stock with:
- **[Strike Price](../s/strike_price.md)**: $100
- **[Premium](../p/premium.md)**: $5
- **[Expiration Date](../e/expiration_date.md)**: One month from now
- **Current Stock Price**: $95

If the price of ABC stock remains below $100, the option is not exercised, and the [trader](../t/trader.md) keeps the [premium](../p/premium.md) of $5 as [profit](../p/profit.md). However, if the stock price rises above $100, the buyer [will](../w/will.md) likely [exercise](../e/exercise.md) the option, and the [trader](../t/trader.md) must sell the stock at the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $100, potentially incurring a loss.

## Applications of a Short Call

### Income Generation

One of the primary motivations for writing call [options](../o/options.md) is generating [income](../i/income.md) through the premiums collected. This strategy is often used by portfolio managers to enhance returns.

### Hedging

Short calls can be part of [hedging strategies](../h/hedging_strategies.md) to [offset](../o/offset.md) potential losses in [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets. For example, an [investor](../i/investor.md) holding a stock may write call [options](../o/options.md) to mitigate [downside risk](../d/downside_risk.md).

### Speculation

Traders may also write call [options](../o/options.md) to speculate on the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price movement. By selling call [options](../o/options.md), traders can benefit from the [premium](../p/premium.md) if the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s price remains below the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).

## Risks of a Short Call

### Unlimited Loss Potential

The most significant [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with writing call [options](../o/options.md) is the theoretically unlimited loss potential. If the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price skyrockets, the [trader](../t/trader.md) could face enormous losses.

### Margin Requirements

Since short calls carry substantial [risk](../r/risk.md), brokers often require traders to maintain high [margin](../m/margin.md) levels in their accounts. Maintaining adequate [margin](../m/margin.md) can incur additional costs and complexity.

### Opportunity Cost

By writing a [call option](../c/call_option.md), the [trader](../t/trader.md) forfeits the opportunity to benefit from any substantial increase in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price. This [opportunity cost](../o/opportunity_cost.md) can result in foregone profits.

## Strategic Use of Short Calls

### Covered Call Strategy

A common strategy that incorporates short calls is the [covered call](../c/covered_call.md). Here, the [trader](../t/trader.md) holds the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) and writes call [options](../o/options.md) against it to earn premiums. This strategy provides a balance between generating [income](../i/income.md) and [offering](../o/offering.md) limited [upside potential](../u/upside_potential_in_trading.md).

### Examples of Covered Call Strategy

Suppose a [trader](../t/trader.md) owns 100 [shares](../s/shares.md) of ABC stock, currently trading at $95, and writes a [call option](../c/call_option.md) with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $100 for a [premium](../p/premium.md) of $5. If the stock price remains below $100, the [trader](../t/trader.md) keeps the [premium](../p/premium.md). If the stock price exceeds $100, the [trader](../t/trader.md) sells the stock at $100, benefiting from both the [premium](../p/premium.md) and the gains on the stock up to the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).

### Protective Call Strategy

Another strategy involves using short calls to protect against potential declines in the [value](../v/value.md) of an investment. This is often used by traders who are moderately bearish on the [market](../m/market.md).

### Examples of Protective Call Strategy

A [trader](../t/trader.md) might [hold](../h/hold.md) a bearish outlook on ABC stock currently trading at $95 and write a [call option](../c/call_option.md) with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $100, collecting a [premium](../p/premium.md). If the stock price decreases, the [premium](../p/premium.md) offsets some of the losses. However, if the stock price increases beyond the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md), the [trader](../t/trader.md) must sell the stock at $100, potentially incurring losses.

## Advanced Strategies Involving Short Calls

### Iron Condor

An [Iron Condor](../i/iron_condor.md) is an [options](../o/options.md) [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) that involves using both puts and calls to create a [range](../r/range.md)-bound [trade](../t/trade.md) with limited [risk](../r/risk.md) and reward. It involves selling a call and a [put option](../p/put.md) at one [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) while simultaneously buying a call and a [put option](../p/put.md) at a higher and lower [strike price](../s/strike_price.md), respectively.

### Example of Iron Condor

An [Iron Condor](../i/iron_condor.md) might involve:
- Selling a [call option](../c/call_option.md) with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $100.
- Buying a [call option](../c/call_option.md) with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $110.
- Selling a [put option](../p/put.md) with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $90.
- Buying a [put option](../p/put.md) with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $80.

This strategy is used when the [trader](../t/trader.md) expects low [volatility](../v/volatility.md) in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

### Butterfly Spread

A [Butterfly Spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md) is another advanced strategy involving short calls. This strategy aims to [profit](../p/profit.md) from low [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and consists of:
- Selling two call [options](../o/options.md) with a middle [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).
- Buying one [call option](../c/call_option.md) at a lower [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).
- Buying one [call option](../c/call_option.md) at a higher [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).

### Example of Butterfly Spread

A [trader](../t/trader.md) might:
- Sell two calls with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $100.
- Buy one call with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $90.
- Buy one call with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $110.

The goal is to [profit](../p/profit.md) if the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price remains near the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of the calls written.

## Conclusion

The short call strategy is a versatile tool in [options](../o/options.md) trading with applications ranging from [income](../i/income.md) generation to hedging and [speculation](../s/speculation.md). Despite its potential benefits, traders must be aware of the significant risks, including unlimited loss potential. By understanding the mechanics, applications, and risks of short calls, traders can employ this strategy effectively within their broader trading or investment approach.

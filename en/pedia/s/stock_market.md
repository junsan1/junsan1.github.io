# Stock Market

The stock [market](../m/market.md), often referred to as the [equity market](../e/equity_market.md) or share [market](../m/market.md), is a key component of a free-[market economy](../m/market_economy.md). It provides businesses with access to [capital](../c/capital.md) in [exchange](../e/exchange.md) for giving investors a slice of ownership in the company. The stock [market](../m/market.md) is essential for [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) as it facilitates the raising of [capital](../c/capital.md) for corporations, in turn, providing funds necessary for [expansion](../e/expansion.md), innovation, and job creation.

## Overview

The stock [market](../m/market.md) operates as a collection of exchanges where [stocks](../s/stock.md) (also referred to as [shares](../s/shares.md)), bonds, and other securities are bought and sold. The two most significant stock exchanges globally are the New York Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (NYSE) and the [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md). [Stocks](../s/stock.md) are [listed](../l/listed.md) on these exchanges, and they represent ownership in companies that are publicly traded.

### Primary and Secondary Markets

The stock [market](../m/market.md) is divided into two main segments: the [primary market](../p/primary_market.md) and the [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md).

- **[Primary Market](../p/primary_market.md):** This is where new securities are created and offered to the public for the very first time through Initial Public Offerings (IPOs). When a company decides to go public to raise [capital](../c/capital.md), it sells its [shares](../s/shares.md) directly to investors in this [market](../m/market.md).
- **[Secondary Market](../s/secondary_market.md):** This is where previously issued securities are traded among investors. Once the initial [sale](../s/sale.md) in the [primary market](../p/primary_market.md) is completed, these securities are [listed](../l/listed.md) on a stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md) and can be bought and sold in the [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md).

## Types of Stocks

[Stocks](../s/stock.md) are generally classified into different categories based on various factors such as the issuing company's characteristics and the growth potential. Here are some common types of [stocks](../s/stock.md):

### Common Stock

The most prevalent type of stock is [common stock](../c/common_stock.md). It represents ownership in a company and comes with voting rights, which typically is one vote per share owned. Common stockholders are at the bottom of the priority ladder for ownership structure; in the event of [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md), common shareholders receive their share of assets only after bondholders, preferred shareholders, and other [debt](../d/debt.md) holders have been paid in full.

### Preferred Stock

[Preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md) represents some degree of ownership in a company but usually doesn’t come with the same voting rights. This type of stock is preferred over common stockholder claims on [earnings](../e/earnings.md) and assets. Preferred [shares](../s/shares.md) typically pay fixed dividends and have priority over common [shares](../s/shares.md) in [dividend](../d/dividend.md) [payment](../p/payment.md). In the event of company [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md), preferred shareholders are paid off after [debt](../d/debt.md) holders but before common shareholders.

### Growth Stocks

These are [shares](../s/shares.md) in companies that are expected to grow at an above-average rate compared to other companies. [Growth stocks](../g/growth_stocks.md) typically don’t pay dividends as the issuing companies prefer to reinvest [earnings](../e/earnings.md) to accelerate growth in the short term. Investors buy [growth stocks](../g/growth_stocks.md) in anticipation of [capital](../c/capital.md) appreciation.

### Value Stocks

[Value](../v/value.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) are [shares](../s/shares.md) in companies that tend to [trade](../t/trade.md) at a lower price relative to their fundamentals, such as dividends, [earnings](../e/earnings.md), and sales. [Value](../v/value.md) investors actively seek [stocks](../s/stock.md) they believe the [market](../m/market.md) is underestimating.

### Blue-Chip Stocks

Blue-chip [stocks](../s/stock.md) are [stocks](../s/stock.md) of well-established companies with a strong record of performance and often have [market](../m/market.md) capitalizations in the billions. These are typically leaders in their respective industries and are considered safer investments. Examples include [stocks](../s/stock.md) of companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Johnson & Johnson.

## Stock Market Indices

Stock [market](../m/market.md) indices are statistical measures that show changes occurring in the stock [market](../m/market.md). An [index](../i/index_instrument.md) is composed of a selected group of [stocks](../s/stock.md), and the performance of this group is used to represent the [market](../m/market.md) as a whole. Some of the most prominent stock [market](../m/market.md) indices include:

- **Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA):** Comprises 30 significant companies [listed](../l/listed.md) on stock exchanges in the United States.
- **S&P 500:** Tracks the [stocks](../s/stock.md) of 500 large-cap companies.
- **[Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) Composite:** Contains all the [stocks](../s/stock.md) [listed](../l/listed.md) on the [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md), encompassing various sectors but predominantly tech.

## Trading in the Stock Market

Investors can [trade](../t/trade.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) through different methods, including the following:

### Market Orders

A [market order](../m/market_order.md) is the simplest type of [order](../o/order.md). This [transaction](../t/transaction.md) type buys or sells [stocks](../s/stock.md) immediately at the best available current price. [Market](../m/market.md) orders provide a high likelihood that an [order](../o/order.md) [will](../w/will.md) be executed, but the price at which the [order](../o/order.md) is executed isn’t guaranteed.

### Limit Orders

A [limit order](../l/limit_order.md) sets the maximum or minimum price at which you are willing to buy or sell a stock. It ensures that the [transaction](../t/transaction.md) [will](../w/will.md) not occur unless the stock price reaches the designated limit.

### Stop Orders

A [stop order](../s/stop_order.md), also known as a [stop-loss order](../s/stop-loss_order.md), is an [order](../o/order.md) to buy or sell a stock once it hits a particular price, known as the stop price. When the stop price is reached, a [stop order](../s/stop_order.md) becomes a [market order](../m/market_order.md).

### Stock Trading Strategies

There are various strategies investors utilize for trading [stocks](../s/stock.md):

#### Day Trading

[Day trading](../d/day_trading.md) involves buying and selling financial instruments within the same trading day. Traders are looking to take advantage of small price movements to make profits. [Day trading](../d/day_trading.md) requires a significant amount of time, knowledge, and [real-time market data](../r/real-time_market_data.md).

#### Swing Trading

[Swing trading](../s/swing_trading.md) seeks to capture gains in a stock (or any [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md)) over a period ranging from a few days to several weeks. Swing traders primarily use [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) due to the short-term nature of the trades, but they may also use [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md) or a combination of both.

#### Long-Term Investing

Long-term [investing](../i/investing.md) focuses on holding [stocks](../s/stock.md) for several years or decades to benefit from the company’s growth. Investors using this strategy typically look at a company’s fundamentals and overall [market](../m/market.md) conditions rather than trying to take advantage of short-term price movements.

## Algorithmic Trading

### Definition and Overview

[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), also referred to as algo-trading or black-box trading, utilizes computer algorithms to execute a large number of trades based on predetermined criteria. It leverages [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md) and automated [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) to perform transactions at speeds and frequencies that human traders cannot achieve.

### High-Frequency Trading (HFT)

High-frequency trading is a subset of [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) that involves executing orders at extremely high speeds. This is made possible by sophisticated algorithms and powerful computers. HFT aims to take advantage of minute price discrepancies that exist for very short periods, often lasting only milliseconds.

### Benefits of Algorithmic Trading

- **[Efficiency](../e/efficiency.md):** [Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) allows for faster and more accurate [order](../o/order.md) [execution](../e/execution.md), which can lead to better prices and reduced [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md).
- **Emotion-Free Trading:** Algorithms execute trades based on predefined criteria, eliminating emotions that can disrupt trading decisions.
- **[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md):** Algorithms can be backtested using historical [market](../m/market.md) data to determine their viability before they are implemented in live trading.

### Risks and Challenges

- **Technological Failures:** [Automated trading systems](../a/automated_trading_systems.md) rely on computer algorithms, which means they can suffer from technological glitches.
- **[Market](../m/market.md) Impact:** Since algorithms are designed to execute large transactions quickly, they can inadvertently cause significant [market](../m/market.md) movements.
- **Regulatory Hurdles:** [Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) attracts regulatory scrutiny to prevent unfair trading practices and ensure [market](../m/market.md) stability.

## Financial Technologies (FinTech)

### Overview

Financial technology, or FinTech, refers to the application of technology to improve financial services. It encompasses various innovations, such as [mobile banking](../m/mobile_banking.md), [payment](../p/payment.md) apps, [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md), robo-advisors, and [crowdfunding](../c/crowdfunding.md) platforms.

### Impact on Trading and Investing

FinTech has dramatically changed trading and [investing](../i/investing.md) by introducing new platforms and services that make it easier for individuals to participate in the stock [market](../m/market.md).

### Key Innovations

#### Robo-Advisors

Robo-advisors use algorithms to provide [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md) services with minimal human intervention. They collect information from clients about their financial situation and future goals and use this data to [offer](../o/offer.md) financial advice and automatically invest client assets.

#### Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Lending

P2P lending platforms connect borrowers directly with investors, bypassing traditional financial institutions. These platforms use algorithms to assess the [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) of borrowers, allowing investors to lend [money](../m/money.md) at competitive rates while providing borrowers with easier access to funds.

#### Blockchain Technology

[Blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) offers a decentralized ledger that can be used for secure and transparent transactions. It has the potential to reduce costs and increase speed in various financial operations, including trading, [clearing](../c/clearing.md), and settlement of securities.

### Notable FinTech Companies

- **[Robinhood](../r/robinhood.md)**: A mobile app that democratizes trading by [offering](../o/offering.md) [commission](../c/commission.md)-free trades of [stocks](../s/stock.md) and ETFs. [Robinhood Website](https://robinhood.com/)
- **Betterment**: An online financial advisory company that provides robo-advising services for [long-term investments](../l/long-term_investments.md). [Betterment Website](https://www.betterment.com/)
- **SoFi**: Offers various financial products including student and personal loans, mortgages, [investing](../i/investing.md), and banking through a single app. [SoFi Website](https://www.sofi.com/)

## Regulatory Environment

Regulation is pivotal in maintaining fair and efficient markets. Key regulatory bodies include:

- **Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC):** In the U.S., the SEC oversees the securities [industry](../i/industry.md), including the stock [market](../m/market.md), to protect investors and maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets.
- **Financial [Industry](../i/industry.md) Regulatory Authority (FINRA):** FINRA regulates brokerage firms and [exchange](../e/exchange.md) markets.
- **[Commodity Futures](../c/commodity_futures.md) Trading [Commission](../c/commission.md) (CFTC):** Regulates the U.S. [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) markets, including [futures](../f/futures.md), swaps, and certain kinds of [options](../o/options.md).

Regulations are designed to ensure [transparency](../t/transparency.md), fairness, and accountability while protecting investors against [fraud](../f/fraud.md) and maintaining the integrity of the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

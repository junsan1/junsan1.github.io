# Short Strangle Strategies

A [Short Strangle](../s/short_strangle.md) is an advanced options trading strategy aimed at profiting from a narrow trading range of an underlying asset. This strategy involves selling an out-of-the-money (OTM) call option and an out-of-the-money (OTM) put option simultaneously. Unlike a straddle, which involves at-the-money options, a strangle uses options that are further out-of-the-money, making it inherently less risky and less costly but also capping potential profit and loss.

#### Key Concepts

1. **Selling a Call Option**: This obligates the seller to deliver the underlying asset at the specified strike price if the option buyer decides to exercise the option.
2. **Selling a Put Option**: This obligates the seller to buy the underlying asset at the specified strike price if the option buyer decides to exercise the option.

By utilizing this strategy, traders aim to capture premium income while betting that the underlying asset will stay within a specific range until expiration. Let's dive deeper into the components and aspects of [Short Strangle](../s/short_strangle.md) strategies.

#### Components of Short Strangle Strategy

1. **Strike Prices**: The strike prices for the call and [put options](../p/put_options.md) in a [short strangle](../s/short_strangle.md) are set outside the current trading price. For example, if Stock XYZ is trading at $100, you might sell a $110 call and a $90 put.
   
2. **Expiry Date**: The expiry dates for both options are typically the same. The choice of expiry can influence the strategy's risk and reward profile.

3. **Premium Income**: The total premium received is the sum of the premiums from selling both the call and the [put options](../p/put_options.md). This premium serves as the maximum profit potential if both options expire worthless.

#### Example

Suppose Stock XYZ is currently trading at $100. You create a [Short Strangle](../s/short_strangle.md) by:

- Selling one 110 Call for $2 premium.
- Selling one 90 Put for $2 premium.

In this case, the total premium collected is $4. If the stock price remains between $90 and $110 until expiration, both options will expire worthless, and you keep the $4 premium.

#### Profit and Loss Potential

- **Max Profit**: The maximum profit occurs if the underlying asset closes between the strike prices of the sold call and put at expiration. The maximum profit equals the total premium received when selling the options.

    Max Profit = Premium from Call + Premium from Put

- **Max Loss**: The potential maximum loss is theoretically unlimited on the upside (if the stock price soars far above the strike price of the call sold). On the downside, the loss could be substantial but limited to the strike price minus the premium collected, as the underlying asset cannot drop below zero.
  
    Max Loss (Upward) = Unlimited  
    Max Loss (Downward) = Strike Price of Put - Net Premium Received

#### Risk Management

- **[Stop-loss Orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md)**: To manage risk, traders often use [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md) that automatically close the position once it moves against them by a predefined amount.
  
- **Hedging**: Traders may hedge their positions using other strategies, such as buying protection options or diversifying their portfolio to offset potential losses.

#### Advanced Variants

1. **Wide Strangle**: This involves setting the strike prices further outside the current trading price, which provides a more considerable safety margin but less premium income.

2. **Narrow Strangle**: This involves placing the strike prices closer to the current trading price, which increases premium income but also increases the likelihood the options will be exercised.

3. **[Iron Condor](../i/iron_condor.md)**: Combining a [short strangle](../s/short_strangle.md) with additional purchased options can further cap potential losses and improve [risk management](../r/risk_management.md). 

#### Factors to Consider

1. **Implied Volatility**: High implied volatility in the underlying asset can increase the premiums collected, but also elevates the chances of significant price movements, thus increasing risk.

2. **Market Conditions**: [Economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md), earnings reports, and [geopolitical events](../g/geopolitical_events.md) can all affect asset price movements. It's crucial to consider short-term and long-term market conditions when executing a [short strangle](../s/short_strangle.md) strategy.

3. **Time Decay**: Options decay over time. The rate of this decay (theta) can work in favor of [short strangle](../s/short_strangle.md) strategies, as the value of the options sold decreases over time, all else equal.

#### Conclusion

A [Short Strangle](../s/short_strangle.md) strategy is a nuanced approach suitable for traders who believe that an underlying asset will remain range-bound over a certain period. While it offers high premium income potential, it also poses significant risks, especially if the market moves sharply in either direction. Proper [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), combined with a solid understanding of market conditions and implied volatility, is crucial for successfully deploying [Short Strangle](../s/short_strangle.md) strategies. Traders should be well-versed in options theory and practice to effectively employ this strategy.

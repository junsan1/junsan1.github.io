# Small Business Administration (SBA)
The Small [Business](../b/business.md) Administration (SBA) is a United States government agency that provides support to entrepreneurs and small businesses. The SBA was created in 1953 as a way to bolster and promote small [business](../b/business.md) endeavors. Its mission is to help Americans start, build, and grow businesses. This support comes in the form of loans, [loan](../l/loan.md) guarantees, contracts, counseling sessions, and other forms of assistance. The SBA operates through a network of field offices and partnerships with public and private organizations.

## SBA Loan Programs
One of the most prominent roles of the SBA is facilitating access to [capital](../c/capital.md) for small businesses. The SBA doesn't lend [money](../m/money.md) directly, but it does act as a [guarantor](../g/guarantor.md) – mitigating [risk](../r/risk.md) for lenders. There are several SBA [loan](../l/loan.md) programs available:

### 7(a) Loan Program
The 7(a) [Loan](../l/loan.md) Program is the SBA's primary program for assisting small businesses with [loan](../l/loan.md) [financing](../f/financing.md). Its flexibility makes it the most commonly used. The funds can be used for a variety of purposes, including working [capital](../c/capital.md), machinery and equipment, [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), and [inventory](../i/inventory.md) purchase.

These loans are typically used for purchasing land, buildings, and equipment. The 504 loans are structured with the SBA providing 40% of the total project costs, a participating [lender](../l/lender.md) covering up to 50%, and the borrower contributing the remaining 10%:
- [Loan](../l/loan.md) amounts up to $5 million ($5.5 million for some small manufacturers)

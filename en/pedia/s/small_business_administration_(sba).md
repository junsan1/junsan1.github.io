# Small Business Administration (SBA)
The Small Business Administration (SBA) is a United States government agency that provides support to entrepreneurs and small businesses. The SBA was created in 1953 as a way to bolster and promote small business endeavors. Its mission is to help Americans start, build, and grow businesses. This support comes in the form of loans, loan guarantees, contracts, counseling sessions, and other forms of assistance. The SBA operates through a network of field offices and partnerships with public and private organizations.

## SBA Loan Programs
One of the most prominent roles of the SBA is facilitating access to capital for small businesses. The SBA doesn't lend money directly, but it does act as a guarantor – mitigating risk for lenders. There are several SBA loan programs available:

### 7(a) Loan Program
The 7(a) Loan Program is the SBA's primary program for assisting small businesses with loan financing. Its flexibility makes it the most commonly used. The funds can be used for a variety of purposes, including working capital, machinery and equipment, real estate, and inventory purchase. Key features include:
- Loan amounts up to $5 million
- Long-term financing
- Low-interest rates
- Wide-ranging eligibility

### 504 Loan Program
The 504 Loan Program provides long-term, fixed-rate financing to small businesses to acquire fixed assets for expansion or modernization. These loans are typically used for purchasing land, buildings, and equipment. The 504 loans are structured with the SBA providing 40% of the total project costs, a participating lender covering up to 50%, and the borrower contributing the remaining 10%:
- Loan amounts up to $5 million ($5.5 million for some small manufacturers)

# Section 1231 Property

## Definition

Section 1231 property refers to a specific classification of [asset](../a/asset.md) in the United States tax code that combines characteristics of both [capital](../c/capital.md) assets and ordinary [income property](../i/income_property.md). Essentially, Section 1231 property includes depreciable property and [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) that is used in a [trade](../t/trade.md) or [business](../b/business.md) and held for more than one year. The unique aspect of Section 1231 property is that it offers a favorable tax treatment: gains are usually taxed at the lower long-term [capital gain](../c/capital_gain.md) rates, while losses can be treated as ordinary losses, providing beneficial tax advantages.

## Examples of Section 1231 Property

### Real Estate

[Real estate](../r/real_estate.md) used in a [trade](../t/trade.md) or [business](../b/business.md), such as [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) plants, office buildings used in the [business](../b/business.md), and rental properties, qualifies as Section 1231 property. It's important to [note](../n/note.md) that the property must be held for more than one year.

### Machinery and Equipment

Machinery, vehicles, and equipment used in [business](../b/business.md) operations and held for over one year also fall under this category. For example, a printing press used by a publishing company would be considered Section 1231 property.

### Livestock

Livestock held for draft, breeding, dairy, or sporting purposes that is held for over a year can be counted as Section 1231 property. For instance, dairy cows used in a farming operation would qualify.

### Unharvested Crops

In some cases, unharvested crops can be considered Section 1231 property if they are sold alongside the land.

## Tax Treatment

### Gains

When sold or exchanged, gains from Section 1231 property are treated as long-term [capital](../c/capital.md) gains, which are subject to lower tax rates compared to [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md) rates. The long-term [capital gains tax](../c/capital_gains_tax.md) rates are currently 0%, 15%, or 20% depending on one's [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md).

### Losses

Losses from the [sale](../s/sale.md) or [exchange](../e/exchange.md) of Section 1231 property are treated as ordinary losses. This is beneficial because ordinary losses can [offset](../o/offset.md) other forms of [income](../i/income.md), including wages, and thus may provide a more significant [tax benefit](../t/tax_benefit.md) than [capital](../c/capital.md) losses.

### Recapture Rules

#### Depreciation Recapture under Section 1245

For [personal property](../p/personal_property.md) (e.g., machinery, equipment) that has been depreciated, [Section 1245](../s/section_1245.md) requires that part of the [gain](../g/gain.md) attributable to [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) be recaptured and taxed as [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md). For example, if a piece of machinery was bought for $100,000, depreciated by $60,000, and sold for $90,000, $60,000 of the [gain](../g/gain.md) would be recaptured as [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md).

#### Depreciation Recapture under Section 1250

For [real property](../r/real_property.md) (e.g., buildings), [Section 1250](../s/section_1250.md) recapture rules apply, where only the excess of actual [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) over what would have been allowed under the straight-line method is recaptured as [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md). Given that straight-line [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) is commonly used for [real property](../r/real_property.md), recapture often applies to properties subject to [accelerated depreciation](../a/accelerated_depreciation.md) in previous years.

### Netting Process

The IRS requires taxpayers to net their Section 1231 gains and losses at the end of each taxable year. 

#### Net Gain

If the net result is a [gain](../g/gain.md), it is treated as a long-term [capital gain](../c/capital_gain.md) and taxed at favorable rates.

#### Net Loss

If the net result is a loss, it is treated as an [ordinary loss](../o/ordinary_loss.md), which can provide a more favorable tax outcome by offsetting [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md).

## Special Considerations

### Five-Year Lookback Rule

The five-year lookback rule requires that taxpayers recapture Section 1231 gains as [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md) to the extent they have claimed Section 1231 losses in the previous five years. The amount recaptured as [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md) is limited to the lesser of the unrecaptured Section 1231 losses from the preceding five years or the [gain](../g/gain.md) for the current year.

### Forms and Filing

Taxpayers need to report Section 1231 transactions on IRS [Form 4797](../f/form_4797.md) (Sales of [Business](../b/business.md) Property). Here they [will](../w/will.md) detail the [sale](../s/sale.md), [exchange](../e/exchange.md), or involuntary conversion of assets, segregate the different types of gains and losses, and apply the recapture rules where applicable.

## Examples to Illustrate

### Example 1: Manufacturing Equipment Sale

A [business](../b/business.md) buys [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) equipment for $200,000 and depreciates it by $170,000 over several years. It then sells the equipment for $80,000. Hereâ€™s what happens:
- Original Purchase Price: $200,000
- [Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) Taken: $170,000
- Adjusted [Basis](../b/basis.md): $30,000 ($200,000 [original cost](../o/original_cost.md) - $170,000 [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md))
- [Sale](../s/sale.md) Price: $80,000
- [Gain](../g/gain.md): $50,000 ($80,000 [sale](../s/sale.md) price - $30,000 adjusted [basis](../b/basis.md))

Under [Section 1245](../s/section_1245.md), the $50,000 [gain](../g/gain.md) is subject to [depreciation recapture](../d/depreciation_recapture.md) and taxed as [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md).

### Example 2: Sale of Commercial Real Estate

A commercial building is purchased for $1,000,000 and depreciated by $200,000 over [multiple](../m/multiple.md) years. It is then sold for $1,300,000:
- Original Purchase Price: $1,000,000
- [Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) Taken: $200,000
- Adjusted [Basis](../b/basis.md): $800,000 ($1,000,000 - $200,000)
- [Sale](../s/sale.md) Price: $1,300,000
- [Gain](../g/gain.md): $500,000 ($1,300,000 [sale](../s/sale.md) price - $800,000 adjusted [basis](../b/basis.md))

For the $500,000 [gain](../g/gain.md):
- $200,000 is subject to recapture under [Section 1250](../s/section_1250.md) and taxed at [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md) rates.
- The remaining [gain](../g/gain.md) is typically taxed at the more favorable long-term [capital](../c/capital.md) gains rate.

### Example 3: Livestock Sale

A farmer purchases 50 dairy cows for $50,000. After five years, the herd appreciates, and the cows are sold for $80,000:
- Original Purchase Price: $50,000
- [Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) Taken: $0 (dairy cows are not typically depreciated)
- Adjusted [Basis](../b/basis.md): $50,000
- [Sale](../s/sale.md) Price: $80,000
- [Gain](../g/gain.md): $30,000 ($80,000 - $50,000)

This $30,000 would be treated as a long-term [capital gain](../c/capital_gain.md).

## Conclusion

Section 1231 property offers a unique blend of tax benefits that can significantly affect [business](../b/business.md) and investment decisions. By enabling the preferential treatment of gains as [capital](../c/capital.md) gains while providing the option for losses to [offset](../o/offset.md) [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md), Section 1231 can provide a powerful tool for taxpayers. Understanding how to classify, compute, and report these transactions is crucial for optimizing overall [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md) and ensuring compliance with IRS regulations.

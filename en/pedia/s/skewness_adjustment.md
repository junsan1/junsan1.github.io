# Skewness Adjustment

In the realm of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), skewness adjustment refers to the process of modifying [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) techniques to account for the skewness of asset return distributions. Skewness measures the asymmetry of the probability distribution of returns around its mean. It provides critical insights into the potential risk and reward profiles of trading assets.

### Understanding Skewness

1. **[Positive Skewness](../p/positive_skewness.md)**: When the right tail of the distribution is longer or fatter than the left tail. In this scenario, a majority of the data points lie below the mean, but there are a few outliers with significantly higher returns. [Positive skewness](../p/positive_skewness.md) implies that there are opportunities for extreme gains, but they are less frequent.

2. **[Negative Skewness](../n/negative_skewness.md)**: When the left tail of the distribution is longer or fatter than the right tail. Here, most returns are above the mean, yet there are some outliers with considerably lower returns. [Negative skewness](../n/negative_skewness.md) suggests potential for extreme losses albeit infrequent.

3. **Zero Skewness**: A perfectly symmetrical distribution with no skewness implies that returns are evenly distributed around the mean.

### Importance of Skewness in Trading

#### Risk Management

Skewness adjustment is critical for effective [risk management](../r/risk_management.md). Understanding the skewness of asset returns helps traders and risk managers adjust their models to more accurately predict potential losses and gains. [Negative skewness](../n/negative_skewness.md), for example, necessitates more conservative [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) as it implies a higher likelihood of significant losses.

#### Strategy Development

Traders develop algorithms based on historical price data. Skewness informs these strategies by highlighting the probability of extreme returns. In portfolios with high [positive skewness](../p/positive_skewness.md), traders might opt for strategies that capture tail gains, whereas with [negative skewness](../n/negative_skewness.md), the focus may be on mitigating tail losses.

### Methods of Skewness Adjustment

There are numerous methods and [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md) employed to adjust for skewness:

1. **Non-Linear Transformations**: Techniques like Box-Cox transformations are used to stabilize variance and make the data more normally distributed, reducing skewness.

2. **Skewness-Adjusted Indicators**: Indicators such as skewness-adjusted moving averages or [Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md) can provide more accurate [trading signals](../t/trading_signals.md) by accounting for skewness in price data.

3. **[Risk Metrics](../r/risk_metrics.md)**: Adjusting Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) metrics to account for skewness allows for better risk assessment and [capital allocation](../c/capital_allocation.md).

### Implementations in Algorithmic Trading Platforms

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) platforms and financial institutions use advanced software and tools to incorporate skewness in their models.

- **[QuantConnect](../q/quantconnect.md)**: An open-source [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) infrastructure provides tools to adjust strategies for skewness. [Visit QuantConnect](https://www.quantconnect.com/)

- **[Quantlib](../q/quantlib.md)**: A free/open-source library for [quantitative finance](../q/quantitative_finance.md) is widely used for incorporating skewness adjustments in [risk models](../r/risk_models_in_trading.md). [Visit QuantLib](https://www.quantlib.org/)

- **Algorithmic Strategies from Quantitative Brokers**: Quantitative Brokers (QB) offer advanced [execution algorithms](../e/execution_algorithms.md) that inherently adjust for skewness in market data. [Visit Quantitative Brokers](https://www.quantitativebrokers.com/)

### Practical Example: Skewness Adjustment in an Algorithmic Strategy

Consider a strategy based on [momentum trading](../m/momentum_trading.md). If the historical returns of the asset show high [positive skewness](../p/positive_skewness.md), the algorithm can be adjusted to take larger positions in anticipation of outlier gains. Conversely, if the asset shows [negative skewness](../n/negative_skewness.md), the strategy may involve setting tighter stop-loss limits to prevent substantial losses.

### Conclusion

In summary, skewness adjustment is an essential component in the toolkit of algorithmic traders. By understanding and adjusting for skewness, traders can improve their [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices and optimize their [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) to more accurately reflect the nuances of asset return distributions. This leads to more robust and resilient [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) capable of delivering better risk-adjusted returns.

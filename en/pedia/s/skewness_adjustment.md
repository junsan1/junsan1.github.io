# Skewness Adjustment

In the realm of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), [skewness](../s/skewness.md) adjustment refers to the process of modifying [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) techniques to account for the [skewness](../s/skewness.md) of [asset](../a/asset.md) [return](../r/return.md) distributions. [Skewness](../s/skewness.md) measures the asymmetry of the [probability distribution](../p/probability_distribution.md) of returns around its mean. It provides critical insights into the potential [risk](../r/risk.md) and reward profiles of trading assets.

### Understanding Skewness

1. **[Positive Skewness](../p/positive_skewness.md)**: When the right tail of the [distribution](../d/distribution.md) is longer or fatter than the left tail. In this scenario, a majority of the data points lie below the mean, but there are a few outliers with significantly higher returns. [Positive skewness](../p/positive_skewness.md) implies that there are opportunities for extreme gains, but they are less frequent.

2. **[Negative Skewness](../n/negative_skewness.md)**: When the left tail of the [distribution](../d/distribution.md) is longer or fatter than the right tail. Here, most returns are above the mean, yet there are some outliers with considerably lower returns. [Negative skewness](../n/negative_skewness.md) suggests potential for extreme losses albeit infrequent.

3. **Zero [Skewness](../s/skewness.md)**: A perfectly [symmetrical distribution](../s/symmetrical_distribution.md) with no [skewness](../s/skewness.md) implies that returns are evenly distributed around the mean.

### Importance of Skewness in Trading

#### Risk Management

[Skewness](../s/skewness.md) adjustment is critical for effective [risk management](../r/risk_management.md). Understanding the [skewness](../s/skewness.md) of [asset](../a/asset.md) returns helps traders and [risk](../r/risk.md) managers adjust their models to more accurately predict potential losses and gains. [Negative skewness](../n/negative_skewness.md), for example, necessitates more conservative [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) as it implies a higher likelihood of significant losses.

#### Strategy Development

Traders develop algorithms based on historical price data. [Skewness](../s/skewness.md) informs these strategies by highlighting the probability of extreme returns. In portfolios with high [positive skewness](../p/positive_skewness.md), traders might opt for strategies that capture tail gains, whereas with [negative skewness](../n/negative_skewness.md), the focus may be on mitigating tail losses.

### Methods of Skewness Adjustment

There are numerous methods and [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md) employed to adjust for [skewness](../s/skewness.md):

1. **Non-Linear Transformations**: Techniques like Box-Cox transformations are used to stabilize variance and make the data more normally distributed, reducing [skewness](../s/skewness.md).

2. **[Skewness](../s/skewness.md)-Adjusted Indicators**: Indicators such as [skewness](../s/skewness.md)-adjusted moving averages or [Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md) can provide more accurate [trading signals](../t/trading_signals.md) by [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for [skewness](../s/skewness.md) in price data.

3. **[Risk Metrics](../r/risk_metrics.md)**: Adjusting [Value](../v/value.md) at [Risk](../r/risk.md) (VaR) and Conditional [Value](../v/value.md) at [Risk](../r/risk.md) (CVaR) metrics to account for [skewness](../s/skewness.md) allows for better [risk](../r/risk.md) assessment and [capital allocation](../c/capital_allocation.md).

### Implementations in Algorithmic Trading Platforms

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) platforms and financial institutions use advanced software and tools to incorporate [skewness](../s/skewness.md) in their models.

- **[QuantConnect](../q/quantconnect.md)**: An [open](../o/open.md)-source [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) provides tools to adjust strategies for [skewness](../s/skewness.md). [Visit QuantConnect](https://www.quantconnect.com/)

- **[Quantlib](../q/quantlib.md)**: A free/[open](../o/open.md)-source library for [quantitative finance](../q/quantitative_finance.md) is widely used for incorporating [skewness](../s/skewness.md) adjustments in [risk models](../r/risk_models_in_trading.md). [Visit QuantLib](https://www.quantlib.org/)

- **Algorithmic Strategies from Quantitative Brokers**: Quantitative Brokers (QB) [offer](../o/offer.md) advanced [execution algorithms](../e/execution_algorithms.md) that inherently adjust for [skewness](../s/skewness.md) in [market](../m/market.md) data.

### Practical Example: Skewness Adjustment in an Algorithmic Strategy

Consider a strategy based on [momentum trading](../m/momentum_trading.md). If the [historical returns](../h/historical_returns.md) of the [asset](../a/asset.md) show high [positive skewness](../p/positive_skewness.md), the algorithm can be adjusted to take larger positions in anticipation of outlier gains. Conversely, if the [asset](../a/asset.md) shows [negative skewness](../n/negative_skewness.md), the strategy may involve setting tighter stop-loss limits to prevent substantial losses.

### Conclusion

In summary, [skewness](../s/skewness.md) adjustment is an essential component in the toolkit of algorithmic traders. By understanding and adjusting for [skewness](../s/skewness.md), traders can improve their [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices and optimize their [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) to more accurately reflect the nuances of [asset](../a/asset.md) [return](../r/return.md) distributions. This leads to more [robust](../r/robust.md) and resilient [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) capable of delivering better [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted returns.

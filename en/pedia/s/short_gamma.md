# Short Gamma

Short [Gamma](../g/gamma.md) is a concept related to [options](../o/options.md) trading, which is integral to the larger field of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) (or algo-trading). This term is most often discussed in the context of [delta](../d/delta.md)-hedging and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) strategies employed by traders, [market](../m/market.md) makers, and institutional investors. Understanding Short [Gamma](../g/gamma.md) involves delving into key concepts like [options](../o/options.md) [greeks](../g/greeks.md), the mechanics of [options](../o/options.md) pricing, and [hedging strategies](../h/hedging_strategies.md).

### Options Basics

Before diving into Short [Gamma](../g/gamma.md), it’s important to understand the basics of [options](../o/options.md) and the [options](../o/options.md) [greeks](../g/greeks.md), particularly [gamma](../g/gamma.md).

#### What is an Option?

An option is a financial [derivative](../d/derivative.md) that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at a specified price (the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md)) before or at a specific date (the expiry date). There are two primary types of [options](../o/options.md): calls and puts.

- **[Call Option](../c/call_option.md)**: Grants the holder the right to buy the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).
- **[Put Option](../p/put.md)**: Grants the holder the right to sell the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

#### Options Greeks

[Options](../o/options.md) [greeks](../g/greeks.md) are a set of [risk measures](../r/risk_measures.md) that describe how sensitive the price of an option is to various factors. The most commonly discussed [greeks](../g/greeks.md) include [Delta](../d/delta.md), [Gamma](../g/gamma.md), [Theta](../t/theta.md), [Vega](../v/vega.md), and [Rho](../r/rho.md). For the purposes of understanding Short [Gamma](../g/gamma.md), the most relevant [greeks](../g/greeks.md) are [Delta](../d/delta.md) and [Gamma](../g/gamma.md).

- **[Delta](../d/delta.md) (Δ)**: [Delta](../d/delta.md) measures the rate of change of the option's price with respect to changes in the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). For call [options](../o/options.md), [delta](../d/delta.md) ranges from 0 to 1, while for [put options](../p/put_options.md), [delta](../d/delta.md) ranges from -1 to 0.
- **[Gamma](../g/gamma.md) (Γ)**: [Gamma](../g/gamma.md) measures the rate of change of [delta](../d/delta.md) with respect to changes in the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). In other words, [gamma](../g/gamma.md) indicates how [delta](../d/delta.md) [will](../w/will.md) change when the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)’s price changes.

### What is Short Gamma?

Short [Gamma](../g/gamma.md) refers to a position in [options](../o/options.md) trading where the [gamma](../g/gamma.md) is negative. This typically happens when a [trader](../t/trader.md) sells [options](../o/options.md) (both puts and calls) rather than buying them.

#### Implications of Short Gamma

1. **Negative [Gamma](../g/gamma.md) Position**: If you are short [gamma](../g/gamma.md), it means that as the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) increases, your [delta](../d/delta.md) becomes more negative, and as the price of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) decreases, your [delta](../d/delta.md) becomes more positive. Essentially, being short [gamma](../g/gamma.md) means that your [delta](../d/delta.md) [will](../w/will.md) move against the direction of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)’s price movement.
  
2. **Increased [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: A short [gamma](../g/gamma.md) position is inherently risky. As the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) moves significantly, the position can lose [value](../v/value.md) rapidly. For instance, if you sell a [call option](../c/call_option.md) and the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) rises sharply, you [will](../w/will.md) face potentially unlimited losses. Similarly, if you sell a [put option](../p/put.md) and the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) falls sharply, you could also suffer significant losses.

3. **[Volatility](../v/volatility.md) Exposure**: Traders who are short [gamma](../g/gamma.md) are exposed to adverse movements in [volatility](../v/volatility.md). While [options](../o/options.md) sellers aim to [profit](../p/profit.md) from [premium](../p/premium.md) decay ([theta](../t/theta.md) decay) in a stable [market](../m/market.md), sudden spikes in [volatility](../v/volatility.md) can lead to substantial losses.

### Strategic Considerations

#### Delta-Hedging

[Delta](../d/delta.md)-hedging is a strategy used to mitigate the directional [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with [options](../o/options.md). For traders with a short [gamma](../g/gamma.md) position, [delta](../d/delta.md)-hedging can be challenging:

- **[Dynamic Hedging](../d/dynamic_hedging.md)**: Since [gamma](../g/gamma.md) measures the change in [delta](../d/delta.md), a short [gamma](../g/gamma.md) position requires frequent adjustments to the [hedge](../h/hedge.md) (buying or selling the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)) to remain [delta](../d/delta.md)-[neutral](../n/neutral.md), especially in volatile markets.

- **Costly Adjustments**: Frequent adjustments can result in high [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md), making short [gamma](../g/gamma.md) positions costly to maintain.

#### Risk Management

Managing the risks associated with short [gamma](../g/gamma.md) positions involves:

- **Proper [Position Sizing](../p/position_sizing.md)**: Limiting the size of the short [gamma](../g/gamma.md) positions to manageable levels.
- **[Volatility Forecasting](../v/volatility_forecasting.md)**: Utilising advanced models to forecast [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and adjust positions accordingly.
- **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: Avoiding concentration in any single position to reduce [systemic risk](../s/systemic_risk.md).

### Practical Applications

#### Market Makers

[Market](../m/market.md) makers, who provide [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) by constantly buying and selling [options](../o/options.md), often find themselves in short [gamma](../g/gamma.md) positions:

- **[Inventory Management](../i/inventory_management.md)**: [Market](../m/market.md) makers need to continuously [hedge](../h/hedge.md) their [inventory](../i/inventory.md), which can be challenging in volatile markets.
- **Advanced Algorithms**: Utilising advanced algorithmic models to automate hedging and reduce manual intervention.

#### Institutional Investors

Institutional investors such as [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds may take short [gamma](../g/gamma.md) positions as part of their broader strategy:

- **[Volatility](../v/volatility.md) Selling**: Selling [volatility](../v/volatility.md) ([premium](../p/premium.md) collection through short [gamma](../g/gamma.md)) can be part of a broader balanced portfolio.
- **[Income](../i/income.md) Generation**: Seeking [income](../i/income.md) through the collection of option premiums, while employing sophisticated [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) techniques.

### Conclusion

Short [Gamma](../g/gamma.md) is a nuanced concept in [options](../o/options.md) trading that encapsulates significant [risk](../r/risk.md) and reward dynamics. Traders and investors engaged in short [gamma](../g/gamma.md) positions must employ sophisticated [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) strategies, [leverage](../l/leverage.md) advanced algorithmic models, and continuously adjust their hedges to mitigate the inherent risks. Understanding the intricacies of [gamma](../g/gamma.md), [delta](../d/delta.md)-hedging, and [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) is crucial for successfully navigating short [gamma](../g/gamma.md) positions in the ever-evolving landscape of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

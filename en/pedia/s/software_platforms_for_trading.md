# Software Platforms

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), often abbreviated as algo trading or automated trading, refers to the use of computer algorithms to automate the process of buying and selling financial assets in the market. These algorithms are designed to follow predefined rules that range from simple decision-making criteria to complex [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md). To implement and execute these algorithms efficiently, traders and financial institutions leverage various software platforms specifically designed for trading. This document explores some of the most prominent software platforms used in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md).

### MetaTrader 4 and 5 (MT4 and MT5)

MetaTrader 4 and MetaTrader 5, developed by MetaQuotes Software, are some of the most widely used platforms in retail FX and CFD trading. MT4, launched in 2005, gained immense popularity due to its user-friendly interface and robust charting tools. MT5, introduced in 2010, is more advanced than MT4, offering additional features such as more timeframes, [order types](../o/order_types_in_trading.md), and market depth. Both platforms support [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) through Expert Advisors (EAs), which are custom scripts written in MQL4 for MT4 and MQL5 for MT5, allowing for the automation of [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

# Section 1245

**Section 1245** refers to specific tax regulations and provisions under the United States Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Code (IRC). These provisions primarily involve the treatment of gains and losses stemming from the [sale](../s/sale.md) or [exchange](../e/exchange.md) of certain depreciable property used in a [trade](../t/trade.md) or [business](../b/business.md). Understanding Section 1245 is crucial for individuals and businesses engaged in trading or other financial activities, as it directly impacts how certain types of property transactions are taxed. 

## Overview

Section 1245 is aimed at recapturing [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) or amortization previously taken on certain types of property. When a [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) sells a Section 1245 property, the tax treatment under this section seeks to "recapture" the [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) deductions that have reduced the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md)'s [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md) over the property's life. The recaptured amount is then taxed as [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md), rather than as a [capital gain](../c/capital_gain.md), up to the amount of [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) allowed or allowable on the property.

### Applicable Properties

The properties that fall under Section 1245 include most depreciable [personal property](../p/personal_property.md) (machinery, equipment, vehicles), certain [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) improvements, and some intangible properties subject to amortization (such as patents, copyrights).

### Calculation

1. **Determining the Adjusted [Basis](../b/basis.md)**:
   - The adjusted [basis](../b/basis.md) is calculated by taking the initial cost of the property and then adding any [capital](../c/capital.md) improvements while subtracting any [accumulated depreciation](../a/accumulated_depreciation.md) or amortization.

2. **Calculating the [Gain](../g/gain.md)**:
   - The [gain](../g/gain.md) on the [sale](../s/sale.md) is the difference between the [sale](../s/sale.md) price and the adjusted [basis](../b/basis.md) of the property.

3. **Recapture of [Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md)**:
   - Under Section 1245, the amount of [depreciation recapture](../d/depreciation_recapture.md) includes the lesser of the [gain](../g/gain.md) realized or the [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) claimed. This portion is taxed as [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md). Any remaining [gain](../g/gain.md) beyond the recaptured [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) may qualify for [capital](../c/capital.md) gains treatment, provided other conditions are met.

### Example

Suppose a [business](../b/business.md) purchased a piece of machinery for $100,000, and over a period of time, it claimed $60,000 in [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md). The adjusted [basis](../b/basis.md) of the machinery would, therefore, be $40,000. If the [business](../b/business.md) then sells the machinery for $70,000, the [gain](../g/gain.md) on the [sale](../s/sale.md) would be $30,000 (i.e., $70,000 [sale](../s/sale.md) price minus $40,000 adjusted [basis](../b/basis.md)).

- The [depreciation recapture](../d/depreciation_recapture.md) amount would be the lesser of the total [gain](../g/gain.md) ($30,000) or the amount of [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) taken ($60,000). Since $30,000 is less, the entire [gain](../g/gain.md) would be subject to [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md) tax under Section 1245.

### Tech Support in Trading and Fintech

Although Section 1245 primarily deals with tax recapture, its implications extend to technology and fintech sectors, particularly in the context of [asset management](../a/asset_management.md) software and financial reporting tools.

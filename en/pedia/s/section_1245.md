# Section 1245

**Section 1245** refers to specific tax regulations and provisions under the United States Internal Revenue Code (IRC). These provisions primarily involve the treatment of gains and losses stemming from the sale or exchange of certain depreciable property used in a trade or business. Understanding Section 1245 is crucial for individuals and businesses engaged in trading or other financial activities, as it directly impacts how certain types of property transactions are taxed. 

## Overview

Section 1245 is aimed at recapturing depreciation or amortization previously taken on certain types of property. When a taxpayer sells a Section 1245 property, the tax treatment under this section seeks to "recapture" the depreciation deductions that have reduced the taxpayer's taxable income over the property's life. The recaptured amount is then taxed as ordinary income, rather than as a capital gain, up to the amount of depreciation allowed or allowable on the property.

### Applicable Properties

The properties that fall under Section 1245 include most depreciable personal property (machinery, equipment, vehicles), certain real estate improvements, and some intangible properties subject to amortization (such as patents, copyrights).

### Calculation

1. **Determining the Adjusted Basis**:
   - The adjusted basis is calculated by taking the initial cost of the property and then adding any capital improvements while subtracting any accumulated depreciation or amortization.

2. **Calculating the Gain**:
   - The gain on the sale is the difference between the sale price and the adjusted basis of the property.

3. **Recapture of Depreciation**:
   - Under Section 1245, the amount of depreciation recapture includes the lesser of the gain realized or the depreciation claimed. This portion is taxed as ordinary income. Any remaining gain beyond the recaptured depreciation may qualify for capital gains treatment, provided other conditions are met.

### Example

Suppose a business purchased a piece of machinery for $100,000, and over a period of time, it claimed $60,000 in depreciation. The adjusted basis of the machinery would, therefore, be $40,000. If the business then sells the machinery for $70,000, the gain on the sale would be $30,000 (i.e., $70,000 sale price minus $40,000 adjusted basis).

- The depreciation recapture amount would be the lesser of the total gain ($30,000) or the amount of depreciation taken ($60,000). Since $30,000 is less, the entire gain would be subject to ordinary income tax under Section 1245.

# Social Security Administration (SSA)

The [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) Administration (SSA) is an independent agency of the U.S. federal government that administers [Social Security](../s/social_security.md), a social [insurance](../i/insurance.md) program consisting of retirement, disability, and survivors' benefits. It was created by the [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) Act, signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1935. The SSA's headquarters is located in Woodlawn, Maryland.

The primary purpose of the SSA is to manage the following key areas of social [insurance](../i/insurance.md):

1. **Retirement Benefits**: These are benefits paid to retirees who have reached a certain age. The age at which one can receive full retirement benefits varies depending on the year of birth. For example, those born in 1960 or later [will](../w/will.md) receive full benefits starting at age 67.

2. **Disability Benefits**: SSDI, or [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) [Disability Insurance](../d/disability_insurance.md), provides monthly benefits to individuals who are unable to work due to a severe disability that has lasted or is expected to last at least one year or result in death.

3. **Survivors' Benefits**: These benefits are paid to the family members of deceased workers who have earned enough [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) credits. A surviving spouse, children, or dependent parents may be eligible.

4. **Supplemental [Security](../s/security.md) [Income](../i/income.md) (SSI)**: While mainly funded through general tax revenues and not [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md), SSI provides stipends to low-[income](../i/income.md) individuals who are aged, blind, or disabled.

## Overview of SSA Programs

### Retirement Benefits

Retirement benefits are the most prominent and well-known component of [Social Security](../s/social_security.md). They are designed to provide a continued [income](../i/income.md) stream for individuals who have retired from employment. Upon eligibility, retirees receive a monthly benefit that is calculated based on their lifetime [earnings](../e/earnings.md) in covered employment.

Factors influencing the amount a retiree receives include:

- **Lifetime [Earnings](../e/earnings.md)**: The SSA uses a formula based on the 35 highest-earning years of a worker's career.
- **Age of Retirement**: Claiming benefits before reaching full retirement age results in reduced benefits, while delaying benefits beyond full retirement age can increase them.
- **Cost-of-Living Adjustments (COLA)**: Benefits are adjusted annually to keep up with [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

### Disability Insurance

[Social Security](../s/social_security.md) [Disability Insurance](../d/disability_insurance.md) (SSDI) provides benefits to individuals who are unable to work due to a qualifying disability. For one to be eligible:

1. **Disability Definition**: The individual must be unable to engage in substantial gainful activity due to a medically determinable physical or mental [impairment](../i/impairment.md). The same [impairment](../i/impairment.md) must have lasted or be expected to last for at least 12 months or result in death.

2. **Work Requirements**: The individual must have worked and paid into [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) for a certain number of years; generally, this is determined by age at the onset of disability.

Applicants must undergo a rigorous evaluation process to determine if they meet the SSAâ€™s strict criteria for disability. This often involves medical examinations and reviews of medical history.

### Survivors' Benefits

When a worker who has paid into [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) dies, their family members might be eligible for survivors' benefits. Family members who may qualify include:

- **Widows/Widowers**: Can receive benefits starting at age 60, or as early as age 50 if they are disabled.
- **Children**: Unmarried children under 18, or up to age 19 if still in high school.
- **Dependent Parents**: Parents who were dependent on the deceased worker for at least half of their financial support.

### Supplemental Security Income (SSI)

SSI is a needs-based program that provides financial aid to individuals who are aged, blind, or disabled and who have limited [income](../i/income.md) and resources. Unlike SSDI, SSI does not require a work history; eligibility is based solely on financial need.

The benefits from SSI can help cover basic necessities such as food, clothing, and shelter. The specific eligibility criteria and benefit amounts can vary by state, as some states supplement federal SSI payments.

## SSA Online Services and Tools

The SSA provides a [range](../r/range.md) of online services and tools to make it easier for individuals to manage and understand their benefits. These include:

- **My [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) Account**: A secure account that allows individuals to view their [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) Statement, [check](../c/check.md) benefit estimates, and manage their benefits online.
- **Retirement Estimator**: A tool that provides personalized estimates of future retirement benefits based on current [earnings](../e/earnings.md) and planned retirement age.
- **Disability Application**: An online application that allows individuals to apply for disability benefits.
- **Medicare Enrollment**: The SSA manages enrollments for Medicare, the federal [health insurance](../h/health_insurance.md) program for individuals aged 65 and older, or those with certain disabilities.

## Financial Structure

The funding for [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) programs primarily comes from [payroll](../p/payroll.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) collected under the Federal [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) Contributions Act (FICA) and the [Self-Employment](../s/self-employment.md) Contributions Act (SECA). Employees and employers each contribute 6.2% of wages to [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) (up to a taxable maximum), while self-employed individuals contribute 12.4%.

The collected funds are deposited into the Old-Age and Survivors [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) (OASI) and [Disability Insurance](../d/disability_insurance.md) (DI) [Trust](../t/trust.md) Funds. Benefits are paid out from these [trust](../t/trust.md) funds.

Concerns about the long-term [solvency](../s/solvency.md) of these [trust](../t/trust.md) funds have been a topic of ongoing debate, with projections indicating that they may be depleted by the mid-2030s without legislative changes.

## Future Challenges and Reforms

The SSA faces numerous challenges and potential reforms aimed at ensuring the sustainability of [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) programs:

1. **Aging Population**: As the Baby Boomer generation retires, the ratio of workers paying into the system versus beneficiaries drawing from it is decreasing.
2. **[Life Expectancy](../l/life_expectancy.md)**: Increasing [life expectancy](../l/life_expectancy.md) means that individuals are drawing benefits for longer periods.
3. **Economic Factors**: Wage growth, employment rates, and demographic changes influence the [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) system's overall health.

Proposed reforms to address these issues include:

- **Raising the Retirement Age**: Gradually increasing the age at which full benefits are available.
- **[Payroll Tax](../p/payroll_tax.md) Adjustments**: Increasing the [payroll tax](../p/payroll_tax.md) rate or lifting the cap on taxable [earnings](../e/earnings.md).
- **Benefit Formula Changes**: Adjusting the benefit calculation formula to reduce future payouts.

## Conclusion

The [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) Administration plays a critical role in providing financial [security](../s/security.md) to millions of Americans through retirement, disability, and survivors' benefits as well as supplemental [income](../i/income.md) for low-[income](../i/income.md) individuals. With various tools and resources available online, the SSA continually strives to serve the public more effectively.

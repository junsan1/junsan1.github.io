# Subprime Mortgage

## Introduction
Subprime mortgages are types of [home](../h/home.md) loans granted to borrowers with lower [credit](../c/credit.md) ratings and, thus, a higher [risk](../r/risk.md) of [default](../d/default.md). Lenders typically charge higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates on subprime mortgages to compensate for the elevated [risk](../r/risk.md). The subprime [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [market](../m/market.md) played a pivotal role in the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) of 2007-2008, triggering widespread economic upheaval. This document provides an in-depth analysis of subprime mortgages, covering their origin, structure, risks, regulatory measures, and their role in the global [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md).

## History and Origin
Subprime mortgages emerged as a financial product in the late 20th century, primarily in the United States. Financial institutions developed these products to extend homeownership opportunities to individuals with poor [credit](../c/credit.md) history who would not qualify for prime loans.

## Structure of Subprime Mortgages
Subprime loans can have various structures, but they often come with adjustable [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, balloon payments, or [interest](../i/interest.md)-only [payment](../p/payment.md) [options](../o/options.md). These features initially make the monthly payments more affordable but can lead to significant increases later.

- **Adjustable-Rate Mortgages (ARM)**: The [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) is fixed for an initial period and then adjusts periodically based on an [index](../i/index.md).
- **Balloon Mortgages**: Borrowers pay small monthly installments for a specific period, followed by a large [balloon payment](../b/balloon_payment.md).
- **[Interest](../i/interest.md)-Only Mortgages**: Borrowers pay only [interest](../i/interest.md) for a set period, with [principal](../p/principal.md) payments beginning later.

## Risk Assessment and Credit Scoring
[Credit](../c/credit.md) scores, such as FICO scores, often serve as indicators of a borrower’s [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md). Subprime borrowers typically have [credit](../c/credit.md) scores below 620. Lenders use various [risk](../r/risk.md) assessment tools and financial data to price the [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with subprime borrowers.

## The Appeal of Subprime Mortgages
Lenders benefitted from higher yields on subprime loans, while borrowers accessed [financing](../f/financing.md) that might otherwise be unavailable. However, this [market segment](../m/market_segment.md) was also fraught with predatory lending practices and insufficient [underwriting standards](../u/underwriting_standards.md).

## Regulatory Measures
After the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md), governments and financial institutions implemented stringent regulations to address the pitfalls of subprime lending. Notable measures include:

- **[Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act](../d/dodd-frank_wall_street_reform_and_consumer_protection_act.md)**: Enacted in 2010 in the United States, this law aims to prevent excessive [risk](../r/risk.md)-taking and increase [transparency](../t/transparency.md).
- **[Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md)**: International regulations imposed stricter [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements on banks.

## The Role of Subprime Mortgages in the 2007-2008 Financial Crisis
Subprime mortgages significantly contributed to the 2007-2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md). Several factors exacerbated the situation:

1. **[Securitization](../s/securitization.md)**: Banks bundled subprime mortgages into [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-backed securities (MBS) and sold them to investors.
2. **[Rating](../r/rating.md) Agencies**: [Credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) agencies often rated these securities as low-[risk](../r/risk.md), which misled investors.
3. **[Housing Bubble](../h/housing_bubble.md)**: Rapid appreciation in housing prices led to speculative borrowing and lending.

When housing prices dropped, many subprime borrowers defaulted, leading to significant financial losses for investors holding MBS and widespread economic disruption.

## Consequences and Repercussions
The collapse of the subprime [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [market](../m/market.md) led to extensive financial instability:

- Major financial institutions faced [insolvency](../i/insolvency.md), requiring government bailouts.
- [Unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) rates surged as [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) contracted.
- Homeowners lost their homes due to foreclosures, leading to a substantial decline in [home](../h/home.md) values.

## The Future of Subprime Lending
While regulatory measures have tightened, subprime lending has not disappeared. It continues to exist but under much stricter oversight. For example, lenders are now required to verify a borrower’s ability to repay (ATR) and follow the guidelines for [Qualified Mortgage](../q/qualified_mortgage.md) (QM) standards.

## Conclusion
Subprime mortgages are a double-edged sword, providing opportunities and risks. The lessons learned from the 2007-2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) highlight the need for [robust](../r/robust.md) regulatory frameworks and prudent lending practices. Enhanced oversight and increased [transparency](../t/transparency.md) are essential to mitigate the risks associated with subprime lending and prevent future economic disruptions.

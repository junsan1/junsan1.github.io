# Short Condor Spread

The Short Condor Spread is a sophisticated options trading strategy designed for traders who anticipate minimal price movement in the underlying asset over the life of the options. It's an advanced strategy, combining elements of both bullish and bearish strategies to create a position that profits from low volatility, often referred to as a "neutral" strategy.

## Overview

The Short Condor Spread is constructed by selling one lower strike call, buying one lower-middle strike call, buying one upper-middle strike call, and selling one upper strike call. It can alternatively be constructed with put options, involving selling one lower strike put, buying one lower-middle strike put, buying one upper-middle strike put, and selling one upper strike put. Despite the involvement of multiple options, it results in a net credit to the trader upon initiation.

### Components of a Short Condor Spread

1. **Sell a Lower Strike Call/Put**: Generates income from the premium received.
2. **Buy a Lower-Middle Strike Call/Put**: Limits risk below the lower-middle strike price.
3. **Buy an Upper-Middle Strike Call/Put**: Limits risk above the upper-middle strike price.
4. **Sell an Upper Strike Call/Put**: Generates additional income from the premium received.

## Objectives of the Strategy

The main objective of the Short Condor Spread is to take advantage of low volatility in the underlying asset. By setting up this strategy, the trader expects the price of the underlying asset to remain within a specific range. The strategy achieves its maximum profit if the underlying asset's price remains between the middle strikes at expiration. 

## Risk Profile

The risk profile of the Short Condor Spread is defined by the net credit received from the sale of the spreads and the maximum loss, which occurs if the asset price moves beyond the strike prices of the short options.

- **Maximum Profit**: Limited to the net credit received.
- **Maximum Loss**: Limited to the difference between adjacent strike prices minus the net credit received.

## Profit and Loss Calculation

To evaluate the profitability of a Short Condor Spread, it is crucial to understand the following scenarios:

1. **If the price stays within the middle strike prices**: Both the outer short options expire worthless, and the premiums from the short options result in the net credit, leading to the maximum profit realization.
2. **If the price moves beyond the middle strike prices but stays within the inner long options**: Partial loss is incurred, but overall, the trade remains profitable.
3. **If the price moves outside all the options' strike prices**: Both long options exercise, leading to the maximum possible loss.

### Break-even Points

To determine the break-even points, two price levels must be calculated:
1. Lower Break-even Point: Lower strike call/put price + Net Credit received.
2. Upper Break-even Point: Upper strike call/put price - Net Credit received.

## Example of Short Condor Spread

Consider an underlying asset trading at $50:

1. Sell 1 Call with a strike price of $45 for $0.50.
2. Buy 1 Call with a strike price of $50 for $1.00.
3. Buy 1 Call with a strike price of $55 for $1.00.
4. Sell 1 Call with a strike price of $60 for $0.50.

Net credit received = (0.50 + 0.50) - (1.00 + 1.00) = -1.00

Profit scenarios:
- If the underlying asset stays between $50 and $55, both outer short calls expire worthless, the maximum profit of $1.00 is realized.

## Position Management

Proper management of the Short Condor Spread involves continuous monitoring of the underlying asset's price movement and volatility. Adjustments may be needed if significant price movements are anticipated or if the volatility increases unexpectedly.

### Adjustments

- **Rolling the Spread**: Moving the entire positions to different strike prices with similar time to expiration or to a later expiration date.
- **Exiting the Position Early**: If the anticipated low volatility scenario is no longer valid, closing out the position to avoid potential losses.

## Ideal Market Conditions

The Short Condor Spread thrives in low volatility conditions with the underlying asset exhibiting minimal price movement. Market conditions might be ideal if economic indicators show stable growth forecasts without significant swings.

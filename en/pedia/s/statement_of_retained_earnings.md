# Statement of Retained Earnings

The Statement of [Retained Earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md) is a financial statement that outlines the changes in [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md) for a company over a specified period. [Retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md) are the portion of net [income](../i/income.md) that a company retains rather than distributes to shareholders as dividends. This statement provides a detailed account of how these [earnings](../e/earnings.md) have been utilized or accumulated within the [business](../b/business.md) during the reporting period. It is crucial for investors, stakeholders, and financial analysts as it reflects a company's capacity for internal [financing](../f/financing.md), its [profit](../p/profit.md) retention policies, and overall [financial health](../f/financial_health.md).

## Components of the Statement of Retained Earnings

1. **Opening [Retained Earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md)**: This is the balance of [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md) at the beginning of the reporting period. It is derived from the [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md) balance at the end of the previous period.

2. **Net [Income](../i/income.md) / [Net Loss](../n/net_loss.md)**: This component reflects the [profit](../p/profit.md) or loss made by the company during the reporting period. If the company has made a [profit](../p/profit.md), it [will](../w/will.md) be added to the [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md), whereas a loss [will](../w/will.md) reduce the [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md).

3. **Dividends Declared**: Dividends are the portion of [earnings](../e/earnings.md) distributed to shareholders. They are subtracted from [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md) as they represent a reduction in the amount retained within the company.

4. **Prior Period Adjustments**: These include any corrections of errors or changes in [accounting policies](../a/accounting_policies.md) that impact the [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md) and are adjusted retrospectively.

5. **Ending [Retained Earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md)**: This is the balance of [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md) at the end of the reporting period, which is calculated by considering all the above components. It forms the opening balance for the next period.

## Importance of Retained Earnings

1. **Internal [Financing](../f/financing.md)**: [Retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md) are a crucial source of internal funds for a company. Instead of relying on external borrowing or [equity financing](../e/equity_financing.md), a company can use its [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md) to [finance](../f/finance.md) [expansion](../e/expansion.md), research and development, or other [business activities](../b/business_activities.md).

2. **[Indicator](../i/indicator.md) of [Financial Health](../f/financial_health.md)**: Consistent growth in [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md) signifies a profitable and potentially stable company. Conversely, declining [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md) might indicate operational issues or a high [payout](../p/payout.md) of dividends.

3. **[Dividend](../d/dividend.md) Policies**: The level of [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md) reflects a company's [dividend policy](../d/dividend_policy.md). Companies with higher dividends tend to retain fewer [earnings](../e/earnings.md), whereas those focusing on growth try to keep more [earnings](../e/earnings.md).

4. **[Investor](../i/investor.md) Insight**: Investors pay close attention to [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md) as they [offer](../o/offer.md) insights into a company’s financial management and future potential. It helps investors gauge whether a company is likely to reinvest profits for growth or [return](../r/return.md) [value](../v/value.md) to shareholders through dividends.

## How to Prepare a Statement of Retained Earnings

1. **Determine the Opening Balance**: Start with the [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md) at the beginning of the period, which can be found on the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) of the previous period.

2. **Add Net [Income](../i/income.md) or Subtract [Net Loss](../n/net_loss.md)**: Obtain the net [income](../i/income.md) or [net loss](../n/net_loss.md) from the [income statement](../i/income_statement.md) and adjust the opening balance accordingly.

3. **Subtract Dividends**: Deduct any dividends declared during the period from the [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md).

4. **Account for Prior Period Adjustments**: Include any adjustments, such as error corrections or changes in [accounting](../a/accounting.md) policy. These alterations should be added or subtracted to reflect accurate [earnings](../e/earnings.md).

5. **Calculate the Ending Balance**: The final [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md) balance is determined after [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for all adjustments. This becomes the opening balance for the next period.

Example:
```markdown
| Description                  | Amount    |
|------------------------------|-----------|
| Opening [Retained Earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md)    | $100,000  |
| Add: Net [Income](../i/income.md)              | $50,000   |
| Less: Dividends              | ($20,000) |
| Add/Less: Adjustments        | $5,000    |
| Ending [Retained Earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md)     | $135,000  |
```

## Implications of Retained Earnings on Business Decision-Making

1. **Investment Decisions**: Companies with substantial [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md) may decide to reinvest in the [business](../b/business.md) through [capital](../c/capital.md) expenditures, research and development, or acquisitions.

2. **[Debt](../d/debt.md) Reduction**: Organizations might use [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md) to pay off existing [debt](../d/debt.md), reducing [interest](../i/interest.md) expenses and improving financial [leverage](../l/leverage.md).

3. **[Dividend](../d/dividend.md) Decisions**: The level of [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md) impacts decisions on whether to increase, decrease, or maintain [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payouts. 

4. **Share [Buyback](../b/buyback.md) Programs**: Companies may also use [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md) for [share repurchase](../s/share_repurchase.md) programs, reducing the number of outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md) and potentially increasing the [value](../v/value.md) of remaining [shares](../s/shares.md).

## Practical Application in Algotrading

In the context of [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) (algotrading), understanding the statement of [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md) can be crucial. Here’s how:

2. **[Earnings](../e/earnings.md) Retention Ratios**: Algorithms can calculate [earnings](../e/earnings.md) retention ratios to predict future growth potential and make informed trading decisions.

3. **[Dividend Strategies](../d/dividend_strategies.md)**: Including [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md) in [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) can help in designing strategies based on [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payments, such as high-[yield](../y/yield.md) [dividend](../d/dividend.md) [investing](../i/investing.md) or [growth investing](../g/growth_investing.md).

4. **[Financial Forecasting](../f/financial_forecasting.md) Models**: Using [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md) data can refine [predictive models](../p/predictive_models_in_trading.md) for [forecasting](../f/forecasting.md) company performance, thereby enhancing the accuracy of [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md).

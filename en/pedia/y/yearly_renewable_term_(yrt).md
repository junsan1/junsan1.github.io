# Yearly Renewable Term (YRT)

Yearly Renewable Term (YRT), also known as annual renewable term (ART) [insurance](../i/insurance.md), is a type of [term life insurance](../t/term_life_insurance.md) that provides coverage for a one-year period, with the option to renew the policy each year. Unlike other types of [term life insurance](../t/term_life_insurance.md) that may [offer](../o/offer.md) a fixed [premium](../p/premium.md) for a specified term (such as 10, 20, or 30 years), YRT policies have premiums that typically increase each year as the insured person ages. This type of [insurance](../i/insurance.md) is particularly useful for individuals seeking temporary coverage or those who want flexible coverage [options](../o/options.md).

## How Yearly Renewable Term Insurance Works

When a policyholder purchases a YRT [insurance](../i/insurance.md) policy, they are covered for one year. At the end of that year, the policyholder has the option to renew the policy for another year. The renewal process generally does not require a medical exam, but the premiums [will](../w/will.md) increase based on the insured's age at the time of renewal. This increment reflects the increased [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with insuring an older individual.

### Key Features

1. **Annual Renewable**: The policy can be renewed every year without the need for a new medical examination.
2. **Increasing Premiums**: Premiums rise each year due to the increased [risk](../r/risk.md) of insuring an older individual.
3. **Short-Term Flexibility**: Provides flexible short-term coverage that can be adapted to changing needs.
4. **No Cash [Value](../v/value.md)**: Unlike whole life or [universal life insurance](../u/universal_life_insurance.md) policies, YRT does not accumulate cash [value](../v/value.md).

## Benefits of YRT Insurance

### 1. Simple and Straightforward
YRT policies are easy to understand and manage. There are no investment components or complex contract terms that need to be navigated, making it an accessible option for those new to [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md).

### 2. Lower Initial Premiums
Initial premiums for YRT policies are typically lower than those for longer-term policies or [permanent life insurance](../p/permanent_life_insurance.md). This makes it an attractive option for young individuals or those on a limited [budget](../b/budget.md).

### 3. Flexibility
YRT [insurance](../i/insurance.md) offers the flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances. For example, if a policyholderâ€™s financial situation changes or they no longer need [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md), they can simply choose not to renew the policy without incurring surrender charges or other penalties.

### 4. No Medical Exams for Renewal
One of the significant advantages of YRT is that policyholders are not required to undergo medical examinations to renew their policies each year. This feature is beneficial for individuals who might develop health issues as they age but still want to maintain [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) coverage.

## Drawbacks of YRT Insurance

### 1. Increasing Costs
While initial premiums are low, the cost of maintaining a YRT policy can become prohibitively expensive as the policyholder ages. This characteristic makes it less suitable for those seeking long-[term life insurance](../t/term_life_insurance.md) coverage.

### 2. Lack of Cash Value
YRT policies do not build cash [value](../v/value.md). This means that there are no savings or investment components, which can be a drawback for individuals looking for a [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policy that also serves as a [financial asset](../f/financial_asset.md).

### 3. Financial Uncertainty
Because the cost of YRT [insurance](../i/insurance.md) increases each year, it introduces an element of financial [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md). Policyholders must be prepared for rising premiums and ensure they can afford to keep the policy as they get older.

### 4. Renewal Limitation
Although YRT policies do not require a medical exam for renewal, some policies have a maximum renewal age, after which the policy can no longer be renewed. This limitation can leave individuals without coverage when they might need it most.

## Use Cases for YRT Insurance

### 1. Temporary Coverage Needs
YRT [insurance](../i/insurance.md) is ideal for individuals who need temporary [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) coverage. For example, a person starting a new job with benefits that include [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) may use a YRT policy to bridge the gap until their employer-sponsored coverage begins.

### 2. Budget Constraints
Young adults or new families who need [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) coverage but cannot afford the higher premiums of long-term policies may find YRT an affordable initial option.

### 3. Supplementary Coverage
Individuals with existing [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policies might purchase YRT as supplementary coverage for a specific period. For instance, someone might need additional coverage while paying off a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) or a significant [debt](../d/debt.md).

## Comparison with Other Types of Life Insurance

### Term Life Insurance
Traditional [term life insurance](../t/term_life_insurance.md) provides coverage for a specified term (e.g., 10, 20, or 30 years). Premiums are fixed for the [duration](../d/duration.md) of the term, but the policy must be renewed at the end of the term, usually at a higher rate and sometimes requiring a medical exam. In contrast, YRT policies must be renewed yearly, with premiums increasing annually but without the need for medical exams.

### Whole Life Insurance
[Whole life insurance](../w/whole_life_insurance.md) offers coverage for the policyholder's entire life, provided premiums are paid. Premiums are usually higher than those of term policies but remain fixed over time. [Whole life insurance](../w/whole_life_insurance.md) also includes a cash [value](../v/value.md) component that can grow over time. YRT does not [offer](../o/offer.md) cash [value](../v/value.md) and is intended only for short-term, flexible coverage.

### Universal Life Insurance
[Universal life insurance](../u/universal_life_insurance.md) offers flexible premiums and adjustable death benefits, along with a cash [value](../v/value.md) component. Policyholders can adjust the amount of coverage and [premium](../p/premium.md) payments to fit their financial needs. While YRT offers annual flexibility and no cash [value](../v/value.md), universal life requires long-term financial commitment and managed investments.

## Conclusion

Yearly Renewable Term (YRT) [insurance](../i/insurance.md) serves as a flexible, short-[term life insurance](../t/term_life_insurance.md) solution for individuals who need temporary coverage, are managing [budget](../b/budget.md) constraints, or require supplementary [insurance](../i/insurance.md). Although it offers lower initial premiums and no medical exams for renewal, the increasing cost and lack of cash [value](../v/value.md) make it less suitable for long-term [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md). Understanding the specific needs and financial situation of the policyholder is crucial when deciding whether YRT [insurance](../i/insurance.md) is the right choice.

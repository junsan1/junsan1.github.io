# Yield on Cost (YOC)

[Yield](../y/yield.md) on Cost (YOC) is a crucial metric used by investors to assess the performance of [income](../i/income.md)-generating assets, especially [dividend](../d/dividend.md)-paying [stocks](../s/stock.md). This metric helps to evaluate the [dividend](../d/dividend.md) [income](../i/income.md) relative to the original investment cost, giving a sense of the growth in [income](../i/income.md) and the effectiveness of the investment over time.

## Definition and Calculation

[Yield](../y/yield.md) on Cost is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{YOC} = \frac{\text{Annual [Dividend](../d/dividend.md) per Share}}{\text{Original Purchase Price per Share}} \times 100 \]

- **Annual [Dividend](../d/dividend.md) per Share**: It represents the total dividends paid by a company per share in a year.
- **Original Purchase Price per Share**: The price at which the [investor](../i/investor.md) initially bought the [shares](../s/shares.md).

For example, if an [investor](../i/investor.md) purchased a stock at $50 per share and the current annual [dividend](../d/dividend.md) paid by the company is $5 per share, the YOC would be:

\[ \text{YOC} = \frac{5}{50} \times 100 = 10\% \]

This represents a 10% [yield](../y/yield.md) on the initial investment, indicating how effectively the investment has generated [income](../i/income.md) over time.

## Importance of Yield on Cost

YOC offers several advantages as a performance metric:

1. **Historical Performance**: It reflects the growth in [income](../i/income.md) since the initial investment, providing a longer-term perspective that complements [current yield](../c/current_yield.md) metrics.

2. **[Dividend](../d/dividend.md) Growth Tracking**: It allows investors to see how [dividend](../d/dividend.md) increases have affected their original investment’s [yield](../y/yield.md), emphasizing the benefits of holding [dividend](../d/dividend.md)-growing [stocks](../s/stock.md).

3. **[Income](../i/income.md) Planning**: Investors focused on generating [income](../i/income.md) can use YOC to track how well their investments meet their [income](../i/income.md) goals.

4. **Psychological Comfort**: Knowing that the YOC is increasing can provide confidence to investors during [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

## Comparing Yield on Cost with Current Yield

- **[Current Yield](../c/current_yield.md)**: This is calculated by taking the annual [dividend](../d/dividend.md) per share and dividing it by the current [market price](../m/market_price.md) of the stock.
- **YOC**: This is based on the original purchase price.

For example:
- If a stock purchased at $50 (with an initial [dividend rate](../d/dividend_rate.md) of $2 per share) now trades at $100 and pays an annual [dividend](../d/dividend.md) of $4 per share, the [Current Yield](../c/current_yield.md) would be 4% ($4/$100), whereas the YOC would be 8% ($4/$50).

The disparity between these yields helps highlight the benefits of holding onto high-quality, [dividend](../d/dividend.md)-growing [stocks](../s/stock.md) over time.

## Strategies to Improve Yield on Cost

### Dividend Growth Investing

Investors aiming to improve their YOC focus on companies with a [robust](../r/robust.md) history of [dividend](../d/dividend.md) growth. These are typically businesses with strong [earnings](../e/earnings.md), solid [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md), and a commitment to returning [capital](../c/capital.md) to shareholders.

### Reinvesting Dividends

Reinvesting dividends to purchase additional [shares](../s/shares.md) can compound returns, increasing the investment’s [income](../i/income.md)-generating potential. Tools like [Dividend Reinvestment](../d/dividend_reinvestment.md) Plans (DRIPs) facilitate this.

### Initial Investment Analysis

Choosing [stocks](../s/stock.md) with strong potential for growth in dividends and profitability at the time of initial purchase is essential. Look for companies with:

- Low [payout](../p/payout.md) ratios
- High [return](../r/return.md) on [equity](../e/equity.md) (ROE)
- Sustainable [business models](../b/business_models.md)
- Competitive advantages

### Holding Period

The longer an [investor](../i/investor.md) holds onto a [dividend](../d/dividend.md)-growing stock, the higher the YOC can become, reflecting the power of [compounding](../c/compounding.md) and consistent [dividend](../d/dividend.md) increases.

## Limitations and Considerations

While [Yield](../y/yield.md) on Cost is a valuable metric, it has its limitations:

1. **Not Reflective of Current [Market](../m/market.md) Conditions**: YOC is based on the initial purchase price, and it does not reflect the current [market value](../m/market_value.md) of the stock, potentially misleading new analysis.

2. **[Inflation](../i/inflation.md) Impact**: Over time, [inflation](../i/inflation.md) can erode the real [value](../v/value.md) of the dividends received, something YOC alone doesn't account for.

3. **Not Suitable for Non-[Dividend](../d/dividend.md) [Stocks](../s/stock.md)**: YOC is irrelevant for [stocks](../s/stock.md) that do not pay dividends, limiting its application to [dividend](../d/dividend.md)-paying investments only.

## Example Companies for High YOC

### Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)

Johnson & Johnson is renowned for its long history of [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payments and growth, making it a popular choice for [dividend](../d/dividend.md) investors aiming for a high YOC over time.

### The Coca-Cola Company (KO)

The Coca-Cola Company offers a compelling case study in [dividend](../d/dividend.md) growth, with decades of consistent [dividend](../d/dividend.md) increases, enhancing YOC for long-term investors.

### Procter & Gamble (PG)

Procter & Gamble has a strong track record of not only paying but raising dividends, demonstrating the traits desirable for building a high YOC.

## Practical Resources

For investors looking to track their [Yield](../y/yield.md) on Cost efficiently, several platforms and tools can be helpful:

- **[Yahoo Finance](../y/yahoo_finance.md)**: Provides detailed historical data and [dividend](../d/dividend.md) tracking which can assist in calculating YOC.
- [Seeking Alpha](https://seekingalpha.com/): Offers [dividend](../d/dividend.md) data and portfolio tracking features tailored for [dividend](../d/dividend.md) growth investors.
- **[Personal Finance](../p/personal_finance_in_trading.md) Software**: Tools like Quicken or platforms like Fidelity and Vanguard [offer](../o/offer.md) [portfolio management](../p/par.md) features that can include YOC tracking.

## Conclusion

[Yield](../y/yield.md) on Cost is a powerful tool for [dividend](../d/dividend.md)-focused investors, providing insight into the performance and [income](../i/income.md)-generating capacity of their investments over time. While it should not be the sole metric used for making investment decisions, when combined with other analyses, it can significantly enhance an [investor](../i/investor.md)'s ability to build a solid and growing [income](../i/income.md) stream from their portfolio.

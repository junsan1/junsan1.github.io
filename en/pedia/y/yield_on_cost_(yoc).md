# Yield on Cost (YOC)

Yield on Cost (YOC) is a crucial metric used by investors to assess the performance of income-generating assets, especially dividend-paying stocks. This metric helps to evaluate the dividend income relative to the original investment cost, giving a sense of the growth in income and the effectiveness of the investment over time.

## Definition and Calculation

Yield on Cost is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{YOC} = \frac{\text{Annual Dividend per Share}}{\text{Original Purchase Price per Share}} \times 100 \]

- **Annual Dividend per Share**: It represents the total dividends paid by a company per share in a year.
- **Original Purchase Price per Share**: The price at which the investor initially bought the shares.

For example, if an investor purchased a stock at $50 per share and the current annual dividend paid by the company is $5 per share, the YOC would be:

\[ \text{YOC} = \frac{5}{50} \times 100 = 10\% \]

This represents a 10% yield on the initial investment, indicating how effectively the investment has generated income over time.

## Importance of Yield on Cost

YOC offers several advantages as a performance metric:

1. **Historical Performance**: It reflects the growth in income since the initial investment, providing a longer-term perspective that complements current yield metrics.

2. **Dividend Growth Tracking**: It allows investors to see how dividend increases have affected their original investment’s yield, emphasizing the benefits of holding dividend-growing stocks.

3. **Income Planning**: Investors focused on generating income can use YOC to track how well their investments meet their income goals.

4. **Psychological Comfort**: Knowing that the YOC is increasing can provide confidence to investors during market volatility.

## Comparing Yield on Cost with Current Yield

- **Current Yield**: This is calculated by taking the annual dividend per share and dividing it by the current market price of the stock.
- **YOC**: This is based on the original purchase price.

For example:
- If a stock purchased at $50 (with an initial dividend rate of $2 per share) now trades at $100 and pays an annual dividend of $4 per share, the Current Yield would be 4% ($4/$100), whereas the YOC would be 8% ($4/$50).

The disparity between these yields helps highlight the benefits of holding onto high-quality, dividend-growing stocks over time.

## Strategies to Improve Yield on Cost

### Dividend Growth Investing

Investors aiming to improve their YOC focus on companies with a robust history of dividend growth. These are typically businesses with strong earnings, solid cash flow, and a commitment to returning capital to shareholders.

### Reinvesting Dividends

Reinvesting dividends to purchase additional shares can compound returns, increasing the investment’s income-generating potential. Tools like Dividend Reinvestment Plans (DRIPs) facilitate this.

### Initial Investment Analysis

Choosing stocks with strong potential for growth in dividends and profitability at the time of initial purchase is essential. Look for companies with:

- Low payout ratios
- High return on equity (ROE)
- Sustainable business models
- Competitive advantages

### Holding Period

The longer an investor holds onto a dividend-growing stock, the higher the YOC can become, reflecting the power of compounding and consistent dividend increases.

## Limitations and Considerations

While Yield on Cost is a valuable metric, it has its limitations:

1. **Not Reflective of Current Market Conditions**: YOC is based on the initial purchase price, and it does not reflect the current market value of the stock, potentially misleading new analysis.

2. **Inflation Impact**: Over time, inflation can erode the real value of the dividends received, something YOC alone doesn't account for.

3. **Not Suitable for Non-Dividend Stocks**: YOC is irrelevant for stocks that do not pay dividends, limiting its application to dividend-paying investments only.

## Example Companies for High YOC

### Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)

Johnson & Johnson is renowned for its long history of dividend payments and growth, making it a popular choice for dividend investors aiming for a high YOC over time.

### The Coca-Cola Company (KO)

The Coca-Cola Company offers a compelling case study in dividend growth, with decades of consistent dividend increases, enhancing YOC for long-term investors.

### Procter & Gamble (PG)

Procter & Gamble has a strong track record of not only paying but raising dividends, demonstrating the traits desirable for building a high YOC.

## Practical Resources

## Conclusion

Yield on Cost is a powerful tool for dividend-focused investors, providing insight into the performance and income-generating capacity of their investments over time. While it should not be the sole metric used for making investment decisions, when combined with other analyses, it can significantly enhance an investor's ability to build a solid and growing income stream from their portfolio.

# Yield-Curve Trading

Yield-curve trading, a sophisticated strategy employed predominantly in fixed income markets, involves trading based on the anticipated movements of the [yield curve](../y/yield_curve.md). The [yield curve](../y/yield_curve.md) is a graphical representation showing the relationship between the interest rate (yield) and the time to maturity of the debt for a given borrower in a given currency. Typically, this term structure illustrates yields for U.S. Treasury securities for various maturities, ranging from short-term instruments like one-month bills to long-term securities like 30-year bonds.

## Understanding Yield Curves

### Types of Yield Curves

1. **Normal [Yield Curve](../y/yield_curve.md)**:
   - The most common [yield curve](../y/yield_curve.md) shape.
   - Long-term yields are higher than short-term yields.
   - Indicates economic growth expectations and inflation.

2. **Inverted [Yield Curve](../y/yield_curve.md)**:
   - Short-term yields are higher than long-term yields.
   - Often seen as a predictor of economic recession.

3. **Flat [Yield Curve](../y/yield_curve.md)**:
   - Short-term and long-term yields are approximately equal.
   - Indicates uncertain economic conditions.

4. **Humped [Yield Curve](../y/yield_curve.md)**:
   - Yields increase with longer maturities up to a point then decline for even longer maturities.
   - Uncommon and can indicate complex market expectations.

## Key Concepts in Yield-Curve Trading

### Yield Spread

The difference between yields on different maturities of bonds is known as the [yield spread](../y/yield_spread.md). Traders often focus on the spread between two specific maturities, for example, the 2-year and [10-year Treasury yield](../1/10-year_treasury_yield.md) spread, to guide trading decisions.

### Duration and Convexity

- **Duration** measures a bond’s sensitivity to interest rate changes.
- **Convexity** measures the curvature of the bond’s price-yield relationship. 

Understanding both helps in modeling how bond prices will react to changes in interest rates, which is critical for yield-curve trading.

### Strategies in Yield-Curve Trading

1. **Trading the Steepener**:
   - This strategy profits from an expectation that the [yield curve](../y/yield_curve.md) will steepen.
   - Involves positioning in long-dated securities over short-dated ones when expecting higher long-term interest rates.

2. **Trading the Flattener**:
   - This strategy profits from an expectation that the [yield curve](../y/yield_curve.md) will flatten.
   - Involves buying short-dated securities and short-selling long-dated securities when expecting lower long-term interest rates.

3. **[Butterfly Spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md)**:
   - A neutral strategy involving three bonds: one with a short maturity, one with a long maturity, and one with an intermediate maturity.
   - Profits from changes in the shape of the [yield curve](../y/yield_curve.md).

4. **Duration-Neutral Strategies**:
   - Positions are constructed such that the overall [portfolio duration](../p/portfolio_duration.md) is neutral, aiming to minimize interest rate risk while capitalizing on relative value between different maturities.

## Tools and Techniques for Yield-Curve Trading

### Yield Curve Models

1. **Nelson-Siegel Model**:
   - Offers a flexible approach to model yield curves with parameters representing the level, slope, and curvature.
   
2. **Vasicek Model**:
   - A one-factor model describing the evolution of interest rates using a mean-reverting stochastic process.

3. **CIR Model**:
   - Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross model, a one-factor model similar to Vasicek but with mean-reverting variance.

## Risks and Considerations

### Interest Rate Risk

- The primary risk in yield-curve trading, involving potential losses from adverse movements in interest rates.

### Liquidity Risk

- Particularly relevant for less liquid bonds, making it challenging to enter or exit positions without impacting prices.

### Model Risk

- The potential for losses due to inaccuracies in the models used for forecasting yield curves.

## Conclusion

Yield-curve trading remains a core strategy in fixed-income markets, demanding a deep understanding of interest rate movements, macroeconomic indicators, and sophisticated [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) techniques. It encompasses a range of strategies from basic trades based on yield spreads to complex positions involving duration-neutral strategies and advanced [yield curve](../y/yield_curve.md) models.

Strategizing trades based on the [yield curve](../y/yield_curve.md)'s anticipated changes enables traders and financial institutions to potentially profit from shifts in macroeconomic conditions, making it an essential component of modern financial market operations.

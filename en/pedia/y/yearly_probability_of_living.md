# Yearly Probability of Living

## Introduction to Survival Analysis

Survival analysis is a branch of [statistics](../s/statistics.md) that deals with death in biological organisms and failure in mechanical systems. This field involves the analysis of time-to-event data, where the event of [interest](../i/interest.md) is often termed as an event, failure, or death. In [finance](../f/finance.md) and [actuarial science](../a/actuarial_science.md), this analysis is critical for understanding the probability of an individual surviving through any given year, which has notable applications in calculating [insurance](../i/insurance.md) premiums, pension plans, and various financial products.

## Key Concepts in Survival Analysis

### Survival Function

The survival function, S(t), represents the probability that an individual survives longer than time t. It is defined as:
\[ S(t) = P(T > t) \]
where T is a random variable denoting the time of the event.

### Hazard Function

The hazard function, \( \[lambda](../l/lambda.md)(t) \), also known as the failure rate, represents the instantaneous [risk](../r/risk.md) of the event occurring at time t, given that the individual has survived up to that time. It is defined as:
\[ \[lambda](../l/lambda.md)(t) = \lim_{\[Delta](../d/delta.md) t \to 0} \frac{P(t \leq T < t + \[Delta](../d/delta.md) t \mid T \geq t)}{\[Delta](../d/delta.md) t} \]

### Cumulative Hazard Function

The cumulative hazard function, \(\[Lambda](../l/lambda.md)(t)\), integrates the hazard function over time and provides a cumulative measure of [risk](../r/risk.md). It is defined as:
\[ \[Lambda](../l/lambda.md)(t) = \int_0^t \[lambda](../l/lambda.md)(u) du \]

### Relationship Between Functions

The survival function and the cumulative hazard function have the following relationship:
\[ S(t) = e^{-\[Lambda](../l/lambda.md)(t)} \]

## Applications in Finance and Actuarial Science

### Life Tables

Life tables, also known as actuarial tables or mortality tables, provide an essential tool in the actuarial analysis. They list the probability that an individual of a certain age [will](../w/will.md) die before their next birthday. Life tables are constructed based on historical data and are used to estimate survival rates.

### Mortality Rate

Mortality rate is the proportion of individuals dying within a specific time period. In the context of life tables:
\[ q_x = \frac{D_x}{N_x} \]
where \( q_x \) is the mortality rate for age x, \( D_x \) is the number of deaths at age x, and \( N_x \) is the number of individuals initially alive at age x.

### Life Expectancy

[Life expectancy](../l/life_expectancy.md) is an estimate of the average number of years remaining in someone's life, given their age. It is calculated using life tables and survival analysis. [Life expectancy](../l/life_expectancy.md) has critical implications for pension plans and [insurance](../i/insurance.md) products.

#### Calculating Life Expectancy

[Life expectancy](../l/life_expectancy.md) at age x (denoted \( e_x \)) can be determined from the survival function:
\[ e_x = \int_{0}^{\infty} S(x + t) dt \]

### Insurance Premium Calculation

[Insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies use survival analysis to price [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) premiums. The annual [premium](../p/premium.md) is calculated based on the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of expected benefits minus the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of premiums paid, ensuring profitability while also remaining competitive.

### Pension Plan Valuation

Pension plans rely on [robust](../r/robust.md) survival analysis to determine the necessary funding levels to ensure that they can provide promised benefits. Expected [life expectancy](../l/life_expectancy.md) and survival rates heavily influence pension valuations.

## Models in Survival Analysis

### Kaplan-Meier Estimator

The Kaplan-Meier estimator is a non-parametric statistic used to estimate the survival function from lifetime data. It provides a step function that increases at observed event times. The Kaplan-Meier survival function is defined as:
\[ \hat{S}(t) = \prod_{t_i \leq t} \left( 1 - \frac{d_i}{n_i} \right) \]
where \( d_i \) is the number of events at time \( t_i \), and \( n_i \) is the number of individuals at [risk](../r/risk.md) prior to time \( t_i \).

### Cox Proportional Hazards Model

The Cox proportional hazards model is a semiparametric model that allows for the estimation of the hazard function while controlling for covariates. The model assumes that the hazard for individual i at time t is given by:
\[ \lambda_i(t) = \lambda_0(t) e^{\[beta](../b/beta.md)' X_i} \]
where \( \lambda_0(t) \) is the [baseline](../b/baseline.md) hazard, \( \[beta](../b/beta.md) \) denotes the vector of coefficients for the covariates \( X_i \).

### Exponential and Weibull Models

#### Exponential Model

The exponential model assumes a constant [hazard rate](../h/hazard_rate.md) over time, leading to a simple survival function:
\[ S(t) = e^{-\[lambda](../l/lambda.md) t} \]
where \( \[lambda](../l/lambda.md) \) is the constant [hazard rate](../h/hazard_rate.md).

#### Weibull Model

The Weibull model generalizes the exponential model by allowing the [hazard rate](../h/hazard_rate.md) to vary over time:
\[ \[lambda](../l/lambda.md)(t) = \[lambda](../l/lambda.md) p t^{p-1} \]
leading to a survival function:
\[ S(t) = \exp(-\[lambda](../l/lambda.md) t^p) \]

## Software and Tools for Survival Analysis

### R

R is a powerful statistical programming language widely used for survival analysis. Packages like `survival`, `survminer`, and `flexsurv` provide [robust](../r/robust.md) tools for fitting, visualizing, and interpreting survival models. 

### Python

Python libraries such as `lifelines`, `scikit-survival`, and `statsmodels` [offer](../o/offer.md) extensive functionalities for performing survival analysis. Python's user-friendly syntax and powerful libraries make it suitable for integrating survival analysis with broader [data science](../d/data_science_in_trading.md) workflows.

### Commercial Software

Commercial software such as SAS, Stata, and MATLAB also provide extensive survival analysis toolsets, often used in actuarial and financial industries. These tools [offer](../o/offer.md) advanced statistical methodologies, user-friendly interfaces, and comprehensive documentation.

## Conclusion

Understanding the yearly probability of living through survival analysis is crucial not only in medical and biological contexts but also in [finance](../f/finance.md) and [actuarial science](../a/actuarial_science.md). Accurately estimating survival functions, hazard rates, and [life expectancy](../l/life_expectancy.md) informs the pricing of [insurance](../i/insurance.md) premiums, [pension plan](../p/pension_plan.md) valuations, and various financial instruments. With advanced statistical models and computational tools, practitioners can develop [robust](../r/robust.md), data-driven strategies for managing [risk](../r/risk.md) and ensuring financial sustainability.

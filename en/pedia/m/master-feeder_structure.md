# Master-Feeder Structure

A Master-Feeder structure is a [fund](../f/fund.md) management setup commonly used in the [hedge fund](../h/hedge_fund.md) [industry](../i/industry.md) to pool [capital](../c/capital.md) from [multiple](../m/multiple.md) investors into a single investment entity, the "Master [Fund](../f/fund.md)." This arrangement enables efficient management, scaling, and regulatory compliance, accommodating investors from various jurisdictions.

## Components of the Master-Feeder Structure

1. **Master [Fund](../f/fund.md)**: The central [fund](../f/fund.md) where all investment activities occur. The Master [Fund](../f/fund.md) holds the portfolio of securities and other assets, and conducts trading activities. Its performance is the cumulative result of all investments made within it, and it provides the [basis](../b/basis.md) for calculating returns for the Feeder Funds.

2. **Feeder Funds**: These are individual funds through which investors contribute [capital](../c/capital.md). Feeder Funds invest virtually all of their assets into the Master [Fund](../f/fund.md), receiving [shares](../s/shares.md) or units in [return](../r/return.md). Different Feeder Funds can be designed to cater to various [investor](../i/investor.md) bases, such as U.S. taxpayers, non-U.S. investors, or tax-exempt entities.

## Key Advantages of the Master-Feeder Structure

1. **[Operational Efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md)**: Centralizing the trading operations in the Master [Fund](../f/fund.md) streamlines the [investment management](../i/investment_management.md) process, reducing operational redundancies and costs. This single trading entity manages the portfolio directly, which can lead to better trading terms and [execution](../e/execution.md).

2. **[Economies of Scale](../e/economies_of_scale.md)**: By pooling assets from [multiple](../m/multiple.md) Feeder Funds into one Master [Fund](../f/fund.md), funds can achieve greater scale, leading to more favorable trading conditions, reduced [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md), and broader investment opportunities.

3. **Segregation of Investors**: Feeder Funds can be tailored to the specific regulatory and tax needs of different groups of investors. This allows the [hedge fund](../h/hedge_fund.md) to comply with various legal requirements while still pooling investments in a single Master [Fund](../f/fund.md).

4. **Simplified Administration**: Administrative tasks, such as [accounting](../a/accounting.md) and reporting, are centralized at the level of the Master [Fund](../f/fund.md), easing the burden on each [Feeder Fund](../f/feeder_fund.md) and facilitating more efficient reporting and auditing processes.

## Example of a Master-Feeder Structure

### Diagrammatic Representation:

```
[Investor](../i/investor.md) Group A (Domestic)
     |
 [Feeder Fund](../f/feeder_fund.md) A (U.S. Investors) 
     |
     v
     |
Master [Fund](../f/fund.md) (Global Portfolio)
     |
     v
[Feeder Fund](../f/feeder_fund.md) B (Foreign Investors)
     |
[Investor](../i/investor.md) Group B (International)
```

### Practical Application

A [hedge fund](../h/hedge_fund.md) might set up a Master [Fund](../f/fund.md) domiciled in a tax-[neutral](../n/neutral.md) jurisdiction like the Cayman Islands. The Feeder Funds could consist of a U.S. [Feeder Fund](../f/feeder_fund.md) structured as a limited partnership for taxable U.S. investors and an [offshore](../o/offshore.md) [Feeder Fund](../f/feeder_fund.md) structured as a [corporation](../c/corporation.md) for non-U.S. investors. Both Feeder Funds invest their assets into the Cayman Islands Master [Fund](../f/fund.md), which executes the [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) on a global scale.

## Regulatory and Tax Considerations

1. **U.S. Tax Considerations**: Feeder Funds that cater to U.S. taxable investors typically need to be structured as partnerships to pass through tax implications directly to investors, avoiding [double taxation](../d/double_taxation.md).

2. **[Offshore](../o/offshore.md) Tax Considerations**: [Offshore](../o/offshore.md) Feeder Funds are designed to attract non-U.S. investors and tax-exempt U.S. investors. These funds are often established in jurisdictions that [offer](../o/offer.md) tax neutrality, ensuring that the Master [Fund](../f/fund.md)'s gains are not subject to local [taxes](../t/taxes.md), which can then be distributed to the [offshore](../o/offshore.md) investors without an additional tax layer.

3. **Compliance**: The Master-Feeder structure must comply with the regulatory requirements of each [investor](../i/investor.md)'s jurisdiction. This includes adhering to securities regulations, [investor](../i/investor.md) [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) standards, anti-[money laundering](../m/money_laundering.md) (AML) rules, and more.

## Conclusion

The Master-Feeder structure is a versatile and efficient [fund](../f/fund.md) management setup that allows [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds to pool resources, reduce operational costs, and comply with varying regulatory requirements across jurisdictions. By centralizing investment activities in the Master [Fund](../f/fund.md), [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds can achieve [economies of scale](../e/economies_of_scale.md), simplify administrative processes, and cater to a wide [range](../r/range.md) of investors.

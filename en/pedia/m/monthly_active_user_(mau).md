# Monthly Active User (MAU)

Monthly Active Users (MAU) is a crucial metric used by technology companies, digital platforms, [social media](../s/social_media.md) networks, and many financial services to assess the engagement and growth of their user base over time. A Monthly Active User is defined as a unique user who engages with a platform or service at least once within a 30-day period. This metric is particularly relevant in understanding user retention, gauging active engagement, and formulating [business](../b/business.md) strategies to improve user interaction and growth.

## Importance of MAU

Understanding MAU provides numerous benefits:

1. **User Engagement**: It gives an idea of how frequently users interact with the platform.
2. **Growth Analysis**: Tracking MAU over time helps in identifying growth patterns and trends.
3. **User Retention**: Evaluating MAU assists in understanding how many new users stay active over time.
4. **[Business](../b/business.md) Decisions**: Companies use MAU for [revenue](../r/revenue.md) [forecasting](../f/forecasting.md), [marketing](../m/marketing.md) strategies, and product development.
5. **Investment and [Valuation](../v/valuation.md)**: Investors often look at MAU to determine a company's growth potential and [market value](../m/market_value.md).

## How to Calculate MAU

The formula for calculating MAU is quite straightforward:

```
MAU = Total Number of Unique Users Engaged in the Last 30 Days
```

Steps to calculate MAU:
1. **Define the Engagement**: Specify what constitutes user engagementâ€”login, purchase, message sent, etc.
2. **Track Unique Users**: Monitor and count the number of unique users performing the defined engagement.
3. **Time Frame**: Ensure the data is collected over a 30-day period.

## MAU vs. DAU (Daily Active User)

Both MAU and DAU are used to measure user activity, but there are key differences:

- **DAU** accounts for unique users active on a daily [basis](../b/basis.md).
- **MAU** gives a broader picture by encompassing a whole month.

While DAU can provide insights into daily trends and peak usage times, MAU offers a longer-term perspective on user retention and engagement.

## Applications in Finance and Fintech

In the realm of [finance](../f/finance.md) and fintech, MAU is an essential KPI (Key Performance [Indicator](../i/indicator.md)) for digital wallets, [payment](../p/payment.md) platforms, trading apps, and other financial services. The metric can help assess the health and growth of financial services:

- **Digital Wallets**: Companies like [PayPal](../p/paypal.md) or Revolut analyze MAU to monitor user adoption and retention.

## Challenges in Measuring MAU

Monitoring MAU comes with its own set of challenges:

2. **Activity Definitions**: Different definitions of "active" can lead to inconsistencies.
3. **Data Quality**: Poor data collection methods can result in inaccurate MAU.
4. **[Seasonality](../s/seasonality.md)**: Monthly variations due to external factors (holidays, events) can skew the results.

# Microfinance

Microfinance refers to a suite of financial services targeted specifically at individuals and small businesses that lack access to conventional banking and financial services. Its goal is to provide low-[income](../i/income.md) individuals or groups with essential [capital](../c/capital.md) to support economic self-sufficiency and entrepreneurship. Microfinance products typically include microloans, savings accounts, [insurance](../i/insurance.md), and [payment](../p/payment.md) systems. This sector has garnered significant attention for its potential to elevate economic status and boost developing economies through grassroots entrepreneurship, although it has faced its share of criticism and challenges.

## History of Microfinance

### Early Beginnings

Microfinance has ancient roots, with practices similar to modern microfinance recorded as far back as 2,000 years ago. Informal lending circles and community-based [credit](../c/credit.md) unions have existed in many cultures, providing small sums for personal or [business](../b/business.md) use.

### Modern Era: The Birth of Microcredit

The modern era of microfinance began with the pioneering work of Dr. Muhammad Yunus. In 1976, Yunus, then an [economics](../e/economics.md) professor in Bangladesh, initiated the Grameen [Bank](../b/bank.md) Project. The project began as an experiment to test if providing small loans to the poor could alleviate [poverty](../p/poverty.md). Yunus and his colleagues extended tiny loans, often less than $20, to women in the village of Jobra without requiring [collateral](../c/collateral.md). The project was a success: the borrowers used the loans to start or expand small businesses, improve their homes, and stabilize their incomes.

By 1983, the project had evolved into Grameen [Bank](../b/bank.md), which formally institutionalized these lending practices. It championed a group-based lending model where small groups of borrowers collectively guarantee each other's loans, thus mitigating the [risk](../r/risk.md) for the [lender](../l/lender.md). Grameen [Bank](../b/bank.md) demonstrated high [repayment](../r/repayment.md) rates, often exceeding 98%, challenging the notion that the poor are uncreditworthy.

## Types of Microfinance Services

### Microloans

Microloans are the cornerstone of microfinance. These small loans, often ranging from $100 to $1,000, are issued to individuals or small businesses without traditional [collateral](../c/collateral.md) requirements. Microloans have facilitated a myriad of economic activities such as agriculture, retail [trade](../t/trade.md), craftwork, and services.

### Micro-Savings Accounts

Many microfinance institutions (MFIs) [offer](../o/offer.md) savings accounts, enabling individuals to safely save [money](../m/money.md) and earn [interest](../i/interest.md). This service is crucial for [financial inclusion](../f/financial_inclusion.md), as it helps individuals build funds for emergencies, future investments, and other financial goals.

### Micro-Insurance

Micro-[insurance](../i/insurance.md) provides protection to low-[income](../i/income.md) individuals against specific risks in [exchange](../e/exchange.md) for regular [premium](../p/premium.md) payments proportionate to their [income](../i/income.md) levels. These [insurance](../i/insurance.md) products cover health, life, property, and agricultural losses, helping families mitigate the financial shocks of unforeseen events.

### Payment and Remittance Services

Microfinance institutions also [offer](../o/offer.md) [payment](../p/payment.md) and [remittance](../r/remittance.md) services. [Remittance](../r/remittance.md) services are particularly vital in many developing countries where migrant workers send [money](../m/money.md) back [home](../h/home.md). Efficient [payment](../p/payment.md) systems allow for the quick transfer of funds, supporting both local economies and family units.

## Microfinance Institutions (MFIs)

Microfinance institutions (MFIs) are specialized entities that provide financial services to those traditionally excluded from the banking sector. These include non-governmental organizations (NGOs), [credit](../c/credit.md) unions, cooperatives, and some commercial banks. 

### Examples of Prominent MFIs

- **Grameen [Bank](../b/bank.md)**: Founded by Muhammad Yunus, Grameen [Bank](../b/bank.md) in Bangladesh is perhaps the most well-known MFI globally. It operates on the principle of group-based lending and focuses extensively on women's economic empowerment.
  
- **BancoSol**: In Bolivia, BancoSol transitioned from being an NGO to a fully regulated [commercial bank](../c/commercial_bank.md). It offers a wide [range](../r/range.md) of services tailored to micro-entrepreneurs.

- **FINCA International**: FINCA operates in [multiple](../m/multiple.md) countries, providing microloans, savings accounts, and [insurance](../i/insurance.md) products aimed at empowering low-[income](../i/income.md) individuals.

## Economic Impact of Microfinance

Despite its small-scale individual transactions, microfinance has had a substantial impact on economies, particularly in developing countries.

### Poverty Alleviation

Microfinance has played a critical role in reducing [poverty](../p/poverty.md) by enabling individuals to start or grow small businesses, thereby generating [income](../i/income.md) and employment. Continuous access to financial resources allows families to achieve short-term and long-term economic stability.

### Women's Empowerment

Microfinance has been particularly effective in empowering women. Many MFIs target women as primary borrowers, enhancing their social and economic positions within their communities. Women, often able to manage household finances, use loans effectively for both [business](../b/business.md) and family [security](../s/security.md).

### Diversification and Economic Resilience

Micro-enterprises supported by microfinance contribute to the [diversification](../d/diversification.md) and resilience of local economies. The growth of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) [spreads](../s/spreads.md) economic [risk](../r/risk.md) and fosters a more [robust](../r/robust.md) economic structure.

## Challenges and Criticisms

Despite its successes, microfinance has faced numerous challenges and criticisms.

### High Interest Rates

One of the significant criticisms revolves around the high-[interest](../i/interest.md) rates charged by some MFIs. Higher rates are often necessary to cover the operational costs of serving remote and low-[income](../i/income.md) clients, but they can also strain borrowers.

### Over-Indebtedness

[Multiple](../m/multiple.md) borrowing from different MFIs can lead to over-indebtedness. Borrowers may struggle to repay [multiple](../m/multiple.md) loans, causing financial stress and potentially pushing them deeper into [poverty](../p/poverty.md).

### Commercialization

The [commercialization](../c/commercialization.md) of microfinance has led to concerns about mission drift. As some MFIs pursue profitability, they may deviate from their core mission of [poverty](../p/poverty.md) alleviation and [financial inclusion](../f/financial_inclusion.md).

## Technological Advances in Microfinance

### Digital Finance and Mobile Banking

Technological advancements have brought significant innovations to microfinance, particularly through digital [finance](../f/finance.md) and [mobile banking](../m/mobile_banking.md). Mobile platforms allow individuals to access financial services from smartphones or feature phones, expanding outreach and reducing [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md).

Examples include:
- **[M-Pesa](../m/m-pesa.md) (Kenya)**: Launched by Vodafone and Safaricom, [M-Pesa](../m/m-pesa.md) is a [mobile banking](../m/mobile_banking.md) service that allows users to store and transfer [money](../m/money.md) through their mobile phones. It has become a vital financial tool in Kenya and other parts of Africa.

### Blockchain Technology

[Blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology is emerging as a transformative tool for microfinance by providing secure, transparent, and cost-effective financial transactions. Projects such as Humaniq use [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) to [offer](../o/offer.md) financial services to the [unbanked](../u/unbanked.md) through mobile applications.

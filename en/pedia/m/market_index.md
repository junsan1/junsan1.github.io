# Market Index

A [market](../m/market.md) [index](../i/index.md) is a statistical measure that tracks the performance of a group of assets.

4. **[Index](../i/index.md) Methodology**: Indices can be classified by the methodology used to compute them:
    - **[Price-Weighted Index](../p/price-weighted_index.md)**: The [index](../i/index.md)'s [value](../v/value.md) is based on the price of its component [stocks](../s/stock.md).
    - **[Market](../m/market.md) Cap-[Weighted](../w/weighted.md) [Index](../i/index.md)**: The [index](../i/index.md) is [weighted](../w/weighted.md) according to the [market value](../m/market_value.md) of its component companies.

# Monetarism

Monetarism is a school of thought in economic theory that emphasizes the role of governments in controlling the amount of [money](../m/money.md) in circulation. It is closely associated with the work of [economist](../e/economist.md) [Milton Friedman](../m/milton_friedman.md) and the University of Chicago, where many of its key principles were formulated and debated.

Monetarists argue that variations in the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) have major influences on national output in the [short run](../s/short_run.md) and the [price level](../p/price_level.md) over longer periods. They advocate for a controlled increase in the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) aligned with the long-term growth of potential GDP, known as the [money](../m/money.md) growth rule. By doing this, they believe economic instability and the cyclical nature of economic booms and busts can be mitigated.

## Key Concepts of Monetarism

### 1. The Quantity Theory of Money
The central foundation of monetarism is the [Quantity Theory of Money](../q/quantity_theory_of_money.md), which can be expressed with the equation MV = PQ, where:

- **M** stands for the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md).
- **V** is the [velocity of money](../v/velocity_of_money.md), or the rate at which [money](../m/money.md) changes hands.
- **P** is the [price level](../p/price_level.md).
- **Q** is the output or real GDP.

Monetarists argue that any increase in the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) (M) [will](../w/will.md) lead to a proportional increase in the [nominal](../n/nominal.md) GDP (PQ), assuming the [velocity of money](../v/velocity_of_money.md) (V) is stable or predictable.

### 2. The Role of Monetary Policy
Monetarists place significant emphasis on the importance of [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) over [fiscal policy](../f/fiscal_policy.md). They believe that changes in the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) are the most effective tools for regulating the [economy](../e/economy.md). Therefore, central banks should focus strictly on managing the [monetary base](../m/monetary_base.md) rather than engaging in active fiscal interventions.

### 3. Money Growth Rule
Monetarists advocate for a steady, predictable increase in the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md), which should be aligned with the long-term growth rate of real GDP. They argue that erratic shifts in the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) lead to economic instability.

### 4. Natural Rate of Unemployment
Monetarists introduce the concept of a "natural rate of [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md)," which is the level of [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) that an [economy](../e/economy.md) can sustain over the long term without accelerating [inflation](../i/inflation.md). Attempts to reduce [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) below this natural rate through monetary stimulus merely lead to higher [inflation](../i/inflation.md), not reduced [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md).

## Monetarism in Policy

### 1. Federal Reserve and Monetarism
The Federal Reserve, the central [bank](../b/bank.md) of the United States, has incorporated many principles of monetarism into its policy framework, although it does not strictly adhere to monetarist doctrine. [Interest](../i/interest.md) in monetarist policies peaked in the late 1970s and early 1980s as central banks began to target [monetary aggregates](../m/monetary_aggregates.md) as part of their strategy to control [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

### 2. Monetarist Economic Policies
Countries like the United States and the United Kingdom have seen periods where monetarist principles influenced economic policy significantly. For example, during the early years of the Thatcher administration in the UK, monetary targets were set to control [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

### 3. Criticisms and Limitations
Despite its influence, monetarism has faced criticisms:

- **Velocity Instability**: Critics argue the assumption of a stable [velocity of money](../v/velocity_of_money.md) is unrealistic as V can change due to shifts in financial innovation and policy.
- **Policy Rigidity**: There are concerns that strict adherence to a [money](../m/money.md) growth rule can be too rigid, limiting a central [bank](../b/bank.md)'s ability to react to unforeseen economic crises.
- **[Inflation](../i/inflation.md) Dynamics**: Some economists argue that focusing solely on [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) neglects the influence of [supply](../s/supply.md)-side factors on [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

## Monetarism and Modern Economic Thought

### 1. Impact on Modern Monetary Policy
While strict monetarism is less popular today, its influence persists. Central banks around the world continue to monitor [monetary aggregates](../m/monetary_aggregates.md) and use them as one of [multiple](../m/multiple.md) indicators to shape [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md). [Inflation](../i/inflation.md) targeting, a mainstay in modern central banking, owes much to monetarist thought.

### 2. Monetarism vs Keynesianism
Monetarism often contrasts with [Keynesian economics](../k/keynesian_economics_in_trading.md), which emphasizes the role of government spending and [fiscal policy](../f/fiscal_policy.md). Monetarists argue that Keynesian policies can lead to inefficient government intervention and long-term inflationary pressures.

### 3. Integration with Other Schools of Thought
Many modern economists advocate for a hybrid approach that borrows from both monetarist and Keynesian principles. For example, while long-term [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) management is seen as vital, short-term fiscal interventions are sometimes necessary to stabilize economies during severe downturns.

## Future of Monetarism

### 1. Digital Currencies and Blockchain Technology
The advent of digital currencies and [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology presents new challenges and opportunities for [monetarist theory](../m/monetarist_theory.md). Cryptocurrencies like [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) have a fixed [supply](../s/supply.md) mechanism, a concept that resonates with monetarist ideals of controlling the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md). However, their [volatility](../v/volatility.md) raises questions about the stability of a [currency](../c/currency.md) not anchored by a central [bank](../b/bank.md).

### 2. Globalization and Monetary Policy
Global [economic integration](../e/economic_integration.md) complicates the relationship between national [money](../m/money.md) supplies and economic performance. As [capital](../c/capital.md) flows freely across borders, central banks must consider international dynamics when setting [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md).

### 3. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)
Central banks are exploring the development of digital versions of their currencies. These Central [Bank](../b/bank.md) Digital Currencies (CBDCs) could [offer](../o/offer.md) novel tools for implementing monetarist policy. By directly controlling [digital currency](../d/digital_currency.md) [distribution](../d/distribution.md), central banks might have more precise control over the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md).

### 4. Financial Technology (FinTech)
The rise of FinTech has the potential to alter traditional banking and financial systems, impacting how [money](../m/money.md) is created and circulated. Monetarists need to adapt their models to account for these developments, ensuring they remain relevant in a rapidly evolving financial landscape.

## Conclusion

Monetarism remains a foundational theory in [economics](../e/economics.md), emphasizing the critical role of [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) management in maintaining economic stability. While its strict application has waned, its principles continue to shape modern [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) and economic thought. As financial technology evolves and the global [economy](../e/economy.md) becomes increasingly interconnected, [monetarist theory](../m/monetarist_theory.md) must adapt to provide insights and [guidance](../g/guidance.md) for future economic challenges.

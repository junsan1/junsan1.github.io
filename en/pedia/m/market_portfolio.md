# Market Portfolio

The [market](../m/market.md) portfolio is a theoretical bundle of investments that includes every type of [asset](../a/asset.md) available in the global [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), with each [asset](../a/asset.md) [weighted](../w/weighted.md) proportionally to its total [market value](../m/market_value.md). Conceptually, it serves as a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for the performance of all risky assets in the [economy](../e/economy.md).

## Theory and Origin

The concept of the [market](../m/market.md) portfolio is heavily grounded in the [Capital Asset](../c/capital_asset.md) Pricing Model (CAPM), a foundational principle in modern [finance](../f/finance.md) theory. The CAPM states that the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) of a portfolio equals the rate on a [risk](../r/risk.md)-free [security](../s/security.md) plus a [risk premium](../r/risk_premium.md). This [risk premium](../r/risk_premium.md) is proportional to the [risk](../r/risk.md) (as measured by the variation in portfolio [return](../r/return.md)) and the amount of [risk](../r/risk.md) (as measured by the [beta coefficient](../b/beta_coefficient.md) of the [asset](../a/asset.md) relative to the [market](../m/market.md) portfolio).

## Mathematical Representation

Mathematically, if we denote the [market](../m/market.md) portfolio by \(M\), the weight of [asset](../a/asset.md) \(i\) in the [market](../m/market.md) portfolio by \(w_i\), and the total [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) of [asset](../a/asset.md) \(i\) by \(V_i\), then:

\[ w_i = \frac{V_i}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} V_j} \]

Where:
- \(N\) is the total number of assets in the [market](../m/market.md).
- \(V_j\) is the total [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) of [asset](../a/asset.md) \(j\).

## Risk and Return

The [risk](../r/risk.md) of the [market](../m/market.md) portfolio is quantified using its [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) of returns, while the [return](../r/return.md) on the [market](../m/market.md) portfolio is analyzed using its [expected return](../e/expected_return.md). Within the CAPM framework, the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) on the [market](../m/market.md) portfolio \(E(R_m)\) can be described as:

\[ E(R_m) = R_f + \beta_m \times (E(R_m) - R_f) \]

Where:
- \(R_f\) is the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate.
- \(\beta_m\) is the [beta](../b/beta.md) of the [market](../m/market.md), which is 1.

## Real-World Application

In practice, while the true [market](../m/market.md) portfolio is undefinable due to the vast array of global assets and their constant evolution, proxies like broad [stock market](../s/stock_market.md) indices (e.g., S&P 500, MSCI World [Index](../i/index_instrument.md)) are often used. These indices are [weighted](../w/weighted.md) by [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) and serve as close approximations.

For example:
- **S&P Dow Jones Indices**: [www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/)
- **MSCI**: [www.msci.com](https://www.msci.com)

## Diversification Benefits

The [market](../m/market.md) portfolio exemplifies perfect [diversification](../d/diversification.md), eliminating [unsystematic risk](../u/unsystematic_risk.md) (specific to individual assets). The remaining [risk](../r/risk.md) is the [systematic risk](../s/systematic_risk.md) inherent to the [market](../m/market.md).

## Role in Portfolio Management

For portfolio managers, the [market](../m/market.md) portfolio serves as:
1. **Benchmarking Tool**: Helps in measuring the performance of actively managed funds.
2. **Guide for Passive Management**: Strategies like [index](../i/index_instrument.md) funds aim to replicate the performance of the [market](../m/market.md) portfolio.

## Efficient Frontier and Market Portfolio

In the context of the [efficient frontier](../e/efficient_frontier.md), the [market](../m/market.md) portfolio lies on the [Capital](../c/capital.md) [Market](../m/market.md) Line (CML), representing the best possible [risk](../r/risk.md)-[return](../r/return.md) combination obtainable by [investing](../i/investing.md) in a mix of the [risk-free asset](../r/risk-free_asset.md) and the [market](../m/market.md) portfolio.

\[ CML: E(R_p) = R_f + \frac{E(R_m) - R_f}{\sigma_m} \times \sigma_p \]

Where:
- \(R_p\) and \(\sigma_p\) are the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) and [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) of the portfolio \(p\).

## Sharpe Ratio

A key performance measure using the [market](../m/market.md) portfolio is the [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md), which assesses [excess return](../e/excess_return.md) per unit of [risk](../r/risk.md). For the [market](../m/market.md) portfolio:

\[ \text{[Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md)} = \frac{E(R_m) - R_f}{\sigma_m} \]

## Market Portfolio in Asset Pricing

[Asset pricing models](../a/asset_pricing_models.md) utilize the [market](../m/market.md) portfolio to determine the appropriate expected returns on risky securities. It's a cornerstone in:

1. **[Security](../s/security.md) [Market](../m/market.md) Line (SML)**: Represents the relationship between the [risk](../r/risk.md) ([beta](../b/beta.md)) and [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) of the assets.
2. **[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) Pricing Theory (APT)**: Uses [multiple](../m/multiple.md) factors including the [market](../m/market.md) portfolio to explain returns.

## Limitations

Despite its theoretical importance, the [market](../m/market.md) portfolio faces several practical challenges:
1. **Uniqueness and Definition**: Difficulties in accurately quantifying and accessing all available global assets.
2. **Assumption Dependencies**: Relies on the assumption of [market efficiency](../m/market_efficiency.md), which may not always [hold](../h/hold.md) true.

## Conclusion

The [market](../m/market.md) portfolio remains a vital theoretical construct in [finance](../f/finance.md), [offering](../o/offering.md) insights into [diversification](../d/diversification.md), [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), and [asset](../a/asset.md) pricing. While its real-world exactitude is unattainable, proxies and models derived from its principles continue to guide investors and academia in understanding [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md) and investment strategies.

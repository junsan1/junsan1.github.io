# Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID)

The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) is a [European Union](../e/european_union_(eu).md) (EU) regulation aimed at increasing [transparency](../t/transparency.md) across the EU's [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and standardizing regulatory disclosures for firms operating in these markets. It was originally implemented in November 2007 and significantly revised as [MiFID II](../m/mifid_ii.md) in January 2018. MiFID is a key piece of legislation for the regulation of investment services and [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) in the European Economic Area (EEA).

## Objectives of MiFID

MiFID is designed to achieve several key objectives:
1. **[Market](../m/market.md) [Transparency](../t/transparency.md)**: Enhance the [transparency](../t/transparency.md) of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) to protect investors and ensure that financial instruments are traded on an organized platform.
2. **[Investor](../i/investor.md) Protection**: Improve [investor](../i/investor.md) protection through better [transparency](../t/transparency.md), reduced conflicts of [interest](../i/interest.md), and increased suitability assessments to ensure that financial products are only sold to suitable investors.
3. **[Market Efficiency](../m/market_efficiency.md) and Integrity**: Promote [market efficiency](../m/market_efficiency.md) and integrity by regulating [trade](../t/trade.md) [execution](../e/execution.md), [clearing](../c/clearing.md), and settlement.
4. **Competition and Choice**: Foster competition and choice within the EU [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) by removing barriers to cross-border investment services.

## Key Components of MiFID and MiFID II

### 1. Market Structure Reforms
MiFID increased the number of trading venues available for equities. [MiFID II](../m/mifid_ii.md) brought additional reforms, ensuring that more financial instruments, including bonds, [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), and commodities, are traded transparently.
- **Multilateral Trading Facilities (MTFs)**: Trading venues that aggregate buy and sell orders.
- **Organized Trading Facilities (OTFs)**: New venues introduced under [MiFID II](../m/mifid_ii.md) for trading non-[equity](../e/equity.md) instruments in a more regulated environment.
- **Systematic Internalisers (SIs)**: Investment firms that execute client orders on their own internal systems.

### 2. Pre- and Post-Trade Transparency
[MiFID II](../m/mifid_ii.md) introduced extensive pre- and post-[trade](../t/trade.md) [transparency](../t/transparency.md) requirements across all [asset](../a/asset.md) classes. This means:
- **Pre-[trade](../t/trade.md) [transparency](../t/transparency.md)**: The requirement for firms to publish current [bid](../b/bid.md) and [offer](../o/offer.md) prices.
- **Post-[trade](../t/trade.md) [transparency](../t/transparency.md)**: The obligation for firms to publish detailed data about completed trades, which must be shared promptly.

### 3. Best Execution
Investment firms are required to take all reasonable steps to obtain the best possible result for clients, taking into account price, costs, speed, likelihood of [execution](../e/execution.md) and settlement, size, nature, or any other relevant considerations. [MiFID II](../m/mifid_ii.md) enhanced these requirements to include:
- **Best [execution](../e/execution.md) policies**: Firms must establish and regularly review their [execution](../e/execution.md) policies to ensure they deliver the best results.
- **[Execution](../e/execution.md) quality reporting**: Firms need to publish annual [execution](../e/execution.md) reports to demonstrate how they achieve the best possible [execution](../e/execution.md) for their clients.

### 4. Investor Protection Enhancements
[Investor](../i/investor.md) protection is a critical component of MiFID and [MiFID II](../m/mifid_ii.md), which includes provisions like:
- **Suitability and appropriateness tests**: Assessments to ensure financial products match the clientâ€™s investment profile.
- **Product governance**: Firms must ensure that products are designed to meet the needs of specific [target markets](../t/target_markets.md).
- **Inducements and fees**: Stringent rules on the acceptance and [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) of fees, commissions, and non-monetary benefits from third parties.

### 5. Data Reporting Services
[MiFID II](../m/mifid_ii.md) introduced new categories of firms known as Data Reporting Services Providers (DRSPs), including:
- **Approved Reporting Mechanisms (ARMs)**: Entities responsible for [transaction](../t/transaction.md) reporting.
- **Approved Publication Arrangements (APAs)**: Providers that publish [trade](../t/trade.md) reports.
- **Consolidated Tape Providers (CTPs)**: Aggregators of [trade](../t/trade.md) data across [multiple](../m/multiple.md) venues.

### 6. Algorithmic and High-Frequency Trading Regulations
Given the rise of automated trading, [MiFID II](../m/mifid_ii.md) imposed strict rules on algorithmic and high-frequency trading, including:
- **Algorithm registration**: Firms are required to register their algorithms with regulators.
- **[Risk](../r/risk.md) controls**: Firms must implement systems and controls to manage risks associated with [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md).
- **[Market](../m/market.md) making**: Firms engaged in high-frequency trading must meet specific [market](../m/market.md)-making [obligations](../o/obligation.md).

## Reporting and Compliance Requirements

### 1. Transaction Reporting
One of the major changes under [MiFID II](../m/mifid_ii.md) is the [expansion](../e/expansion.md) of [transaction](../t/transaction.md) reporting requirements. Firms must report detailed information about trades to their national competent authorities (NCAs), enhancing monitoring and ensuring [market](../m/market.md) integrity.

### 2. Trade and Transaction Reporting Fields
[MiFID II](../m/mifid_ii.md) requires investment firms to include a multitude of fields in their [transaction](../t/transaction.md) reports. This data is used by regulators to detect [market](../m/market.md) abuse and monitor [systemic risk](../s/systemic_risk.md).

### 3. Record Keeping
Firms must retain extensive records of all services, activities, and transactions for at least five years. This includes records of communications that lead to transactions such as phone recordings and electronic communications.

## Impacts of MiFID and MiFID II

### 1. Market Dynamics
MiFID and [MiFID II](../m/mifid_ii.md) have transformed [market](../m/market.md) structure by introducing more competition and decreasing [market](../m/market.md) fragmentation. New platforms and venues have emerged, [offering](../o/offering.md) innovative trading solutions.

### 2. Cost of Compliance
The cost of regulatory compliance has increased due to [robust](../r/robust.md) data reporting requirements and the need for greater [transparency](../t/transparency.md). Firms have had to invest significantly in technology, training, and new processes to meet these [obligations](../o/obligation.md).

### 3. Investor Lifecycle
[Investor](../i/investor.md) lifecycle management has been impacted by the need to perform continuous suitability assessments and undertake stringent [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md) processes.

### 4. Impact on Algorithmic Trading
[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) has been subject to tighter regulation to ensure it does not exacerbate [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) or contribute to [systemic risk](../s/systemic_risk.md).

## Conclusion

MiFID and [MiFID II](../m/mifid_ii.md) play an essential role in shaping the financial [market](../m/market.md) landscape within the EU. They aim to create a more transparent, competitive, and stable [market](../m/market.md) environment while providing increased protection to investors. The regulations have set a high standard for [market](../m/market.md) practices, affecting every aspect of investment services from [market](../m/market.md) structure to reporting and beyond.

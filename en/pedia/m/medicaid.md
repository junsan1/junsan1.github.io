# Medicaid

Medicaid is a [joint](../j/joint.md) federal and state program in the United States that provides healthcare coverage to low-[income](../i/income.md) individuals and families. The program was established in 1965 under Title XIX of the [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) Act, alongside Medicare, to ensure that vulnerable populations have access to essential medical services. Medicaid covers a wide [range](../r/range.md) of healthcare services, including hospital care, doctor visits, long-term care, and preventive services. As of 2021, over 75 million Americans rely on Medicaid for their healthcare needs.

## Eligibility and Enrollment

### Federal Poverty Level (FPL)

Eligibility for Medicaid is primarily determined by [income](../i/income.md), which is measured as a percentage of the Federal [Poverty](../p/poverty.md) Level (FPL). The FPL is updated annually by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and varies depending on household size. States have some flexibility in setting [income](../i/income.md) eligibility thresholds but must adhere to federal minimum requirements.

### Categories of Eligibility

Medicaid eligibility is divided into several categories, each with its own criteria:

1. **Low-[Income](../i/income.md) Families**: Adults with dependent children who meet specific [income](../i/income.md) criteria.
2. **Pregnant Women**: Women who are pregnant and meet [income](../i/income.md) requirements.
3. **Children**: Individuals under the age of 19 who meet [income](../i/income.md) criteria.
4. **Elderly and Disabled**: Individuals over 65 and people with disabilities who meet [income](../i/income.md) and [asset](../a/asset.md) requirements.
5. **Medically Needy**: Individuals whose medical expenses significantly reduce their [income](../i/income.md), making them eligible for Medicaid.

### Expansion under the Affordable Care Act (ACA)

The ACA, enacted in 2010, expanded Medicaid eligibility to all adults with incomes up to 138% of the FPL. However, the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that states could opt-out of this [expansion](../e/expansion.md). As a result, Medicaid [expansion](../e/expansion.md) varies by state, with some states adopting the larger coverage criteria and others maintaining more restrictive requirements.

## Funding and State Administration

### Federal Match

Medicaid is funded jointly by the federal government and individual states. The federal government provides a matching percentage (Federal Medical Assistance Percentage or FMAP) that varies by state. The FMAP is determined using a formula based on the state’s [per capita](../p/per_capita.md) [income](../i/income.md) relative to the national average. Poorer states receive a higher matching rate.

### State Administration

Each state administers its own Medicaid program, subject to federal guidelines. States have considerable flexibility in designing their programs, including setting provider [payment](../p/payment.md) rates, selecting covered services, and determining eligibility criteria (within federal limits). This means that Medicaid programs can vary significantly from one state to another.

### Waivers

States can request waivers from the federal government to test and implement innovative approaches to Medicaid. Common waivers include:

1. **1115 Waivers**: Allow states to pilot experimental, pilot, or demonstration projects that promote Medicaid’s objectives.
2. **1915(b) Waivers**: Permit states to implement managed care delivery systems or limit healthcare provider choices for beneficiaries.
3. **1915(c) [Home](../h/home.md) and Community-Based Services (HCBS) Waivers**: Enable states to provide long-term care services in [home](../h/home.md) and community settings rather than institutions.

## Covered Services

Medicaid covers a comprehensive [range](../r/range.md) of services, although specific benefits can vary by state. Mandatory benefits include:

1. **Hospital Services**: Inpatient and outpatient hospital care.
2. **Doctor Services**: General and specialist healthcare provider visits.
3. **Laboratory and X-ray Services**: Diagnostic and laboratory testing.
4. **Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT)**: Comprehensive and preventive services for children under 21.
5. **Long-Term Care Services**: Nursing [home](../h/home.md) care and [home](../h/home.md) health services.
6. **Family Planning Services**: Contraceptive services, counseling, and supplies.

States can also [offer](../o/offer.md) optional benefits, such as:

1. **Prescription Drugs**
2. **Dental Services**
3. **Physical and Occupational Therapy**
4. **Vision Services**
5. **Chiropractic Care**

## Impact and Challenges

### Healthcare Access and Outcomes

Medicaid has significantly improved access to healthcare for low-[income](../i/income.md) individuals and families. Research indicates that Medicaid enrollment is associated with greater use of primary and preventive care services, improved chronic disease management, and better health outcomes.

### Financial Protection

Medicaid provides substantial financial protection by reducing out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-[income](../i/income.md) individuals. It helps prevent medical [debt](../d/debt.md) and [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md), which are common among uninsured populations.

### Budgetary Strain

Medicaid represents a significant portion of state budgets, often being the second-largest expenditure after education. Rising healthcare costs and increasing enrollment have strained state finances, leading some states to seek cost-containment measures such as managed care models and waiver programs.

## Future Directions

### Policy Reforms

The future of Medicaid is subject to ongoing policy debates. Proposals for reform include:

1. **Block Grants or [Per Capita](../p/per_capita.md) Caps**: Implementing funding caps to provide states with fixed amounts of federal funding, aimed at increasing state flexibility and controlling costs.
2. **Work Requirements**: Requiring beneficiaries to work or engage in community service to receive benefits, although such requirements have faced legal challenges.
3. **[Expansion](../e/expansion.md) and Contraction**: Continuing debates on whether to expand Medicaid eligibility further or enact more restrictive policies.

### Technological Innovations

Technological advancements [offer](../o/offer.md) opportunities to enhance Medicaid administration and service delivery. Innovations include:

1. **Telehealth**: Expanding access to healthcare services via telecommunication technologies, particularly beneficial in rural and underserved areas.
2. **Electronic Health Records (EHRs)**: Improving care coordination and patient outcomes through shared electronic medical records.
3. **[Data Analytics](../d/data_analytics.md)**: Using [data analytics](../d/data_analytics.md) to identify care [gaps](../g/gap.md), manage population health, and optimize resource allocation.

### Integrating Social Determinants of Health (SDOH)

Recognizing the impact of social determinants of health on medical outcomes, Medicaid programs are increasingly addressing factors such as housing, nutrition, and transportation. Initiatives include:

1. **Medicaid Managed Care Plans**: Incorporating SDOH into care management strategies.
2. **Community Partnerships**: Collaborating with social services organizations to provide comprehensive care.

In conclusion, Medicaid is a vital program that provides healthcare coverage to millions of low-[income](../i/income.md) Americans. Despite its successes, it faces ongoing challenges and opportunities for reform and innovation. The future of Medicaid [will](../w/will.md) likely involve a balance between expanding access to care, controlling costs, and integrating new technologies and approaches to address the broader determinants of health.

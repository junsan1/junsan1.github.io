# Make to Order (MTO)

## Introduction
Make to [Order](../o/order.md) (MTO), also known as Build to [Order](../o/order.md) (BTO), is a production strategy wherein the [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) process begins only after receiving a [customer](../c/customer.md)'s [order](../o/order.md). Unlike traditional [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) models that rely on anticipatory production and mass [inventory](../i/inventory.md), MTO focuses on customization and production based on specific client demands. This method allows companies to produce goods that closely match the individual requirements of their customers, ensuring a high level of satisfaction and reducing [inventory](../i/inventory.md) costs.

## Key Components and Workflows

### Customer Order Administration 
The process starts with receiving and processing a [customer](../c/customer.md)'s [order](../o/order.md). This involves detailed specification of the product features, materials, and any customization [options](../o/options.md). Effective [customer](../c/customer.md) [order](../o/order.md) administration systems allow for seamless communication between the [customer](../c/customer.md), sales team, and production units.

### Production Planning and Scheduling
Once the [order](../o/order.md) is confirmed, detailed production planning and scheduling are crucial. This stage includes ordering [raw materials](../r/raw_materials.md), allocating resources, scheduling work shifts, and setting timelines to ensure timely completion of the [order](../o/order.md).

### Procurement and Inventory Management
Given that [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) starts post-[order](../o/order.md), precise [procurement](../p/procurement.md) and [inventory management](../i/inventory_management.md) become essential. Unlike Make to Stock (MTS) systems, where [raw materials](../r/raw_materials.md) are held in anticipation of future [demand](../d/demand.md), MTO systems [order](../o/order.md) materials specific to each [order](../o/order.md), helping to minimize excess [inventory](../i/inventory.md) and [holding costs](../h/holding_costs.md).

### Manufacturing Process 
The actual [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) or assembly takes place once materials are procured. This process can [range](../r/range.md) from simple assembly to complex fabrication, often involving sophisticated machinery and skilled labor. Given the bespoke nature of the production, different orders might require different workflows, thus demanding high flexibility in operations.

### Quality Control
[Quality control](../q/quality_control.md) in an MTO environment is often more stringent compared to [mass production](../m/mass_production.md). Since the goods are customized, each [order](../o/order.md) undergoes detailed inspections and tests to ensure it meets the [customer](../c/customer.md)'s specifications and quality standards.

### Delivery and Logistics
Efficient delivery and [logistics](../l/logistics.md) are key to the success of the MTO model. Ensuring timely delivery while maintaining product integrity is critical. Advanced [logistics](../l/logistics.md) planning and coordination are required to synchronize the various stages of production and delivery.

## Advantages of Make to Order

### Customization and Flexibility
One of the foremost benefits of MTO is its ability to provide high levels of customization, catering to individual [customer](../c/customer.md) preferences. This flexibility can be a significant [competitive advantage](../c/competitive_advantage.md) in markets where customization is in [demand](../d/demand.md).

### Reduced Inventory Costs
Since production begins only after an [order](../o/order.md) is received, MTO significantly reduces the need for large inventories, minimizing both storage costs and the [risk](../r/risk.md) of obsolescence.

### Better Cash Flow Management
Due to the alignment of production with actual orders and associated payments, [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) management is more straightforward. Companies are less likely to face the financial strain of tied-up [capital](../c/capital.md) in unsold [inventory](../i/inventory.md).

### High Quality and Customer Satisfaction
Uniform attention to each [order](../o/order.md) ensures high product quality and better alignment with [customer](../c/customer.md) expectations, thereby improving [customer](../c/customer.md) satisfaction and loyalty.

## Disadvantages and Challenges

### Longer Lead Times
One of the major drawbacks of the MTO model is longer lead times compared to pre-manufactured stock models. The additional time required for [order](../o/order.md) processing, [procurement](../p/procurement.md), and production can be a significant disadvantage in time-sensitive markets.

### Complex Planning and Coordination
The MTO process demands precise and coordinated planning across various departments. Any hiccups in [procurement](../p/procurement.md), production, or [quality control](../q/quality_control.md) can lead to delays and increased costs.

### Higher Costs 
Customization often comes at a higher price point due to the lack of [economies of scale](../e/economies_of_scale.md), specialized labor, and the use of bespoke materials. This can make MTO products more expensive compared to their mass-produced counterparts.

## Industries and Applications

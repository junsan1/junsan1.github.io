Casting involves pouring liquid material, such as molten metal, into a mold where it solidifies into a specific shape. This process is commonly used in the production of complex shapes that would be difficult or uneconomical to make by other methods.

### 2. **Machining**

Machining is a process used to create desired shapes by removing material from a workpiece. It includes techniques like drilling, grinding, milling, and turning. This process offers high precision and the ability to create intricate details.

### 3. **Joining**

Joining processes involve assembling components together to form a complete product. Common methods include welding, brazing, soldering, and the use of adhesives. Each technique provides various levels of strength and durability.

### 4. **Additive Manufacturing**

Additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, involves building products layer by layer from digital models. This technology enables the creation of complex geometries that were previously impossible or too costly with traditional manufacturing methods.

### 5. **Forming**

Forming processes manipulate materials into desired shapes through mechanical deformation. Methods include forging, rolling, extrusion, and stamping. Forming is typically used with metals and plastics.

## Manufacturing Systems

### 1. **Mass Production**

Mass production entails producing large quantities of identical products, utilizing assembly lines or automation. This system is highly efficient and cost-effective, but it lacks flexibility.

### 2. **Lean Manufacturing**

Lean manufacturing focuses on minimizing waste and maximizing efficiency. Techniques such as just-in-time (JIT) delivery, Six Sigma, and continuous improvement (Kaizen) are commonly used to streamline processes and improve quality.

### 3. **Batch Production**

Batch production involves producing a specific number of products within a set timeframe. This method offers more flexibility compared to mass production but may involve switching between different products, which can be less efficient.

### 4. **Custom Manufacturing**

Custom manufacturing is tailored to produce unique products based on specific customer requirements. This system is highly flexible but generally slower and more expensive than other types.

## Key Technologies in Modern Manufacturing

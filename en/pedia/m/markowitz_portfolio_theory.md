# Markowitz Portfolio Theory

Markowitz Portfolio Theory, also known as Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), is an investment theory developed by Harry Markowitz in 1952. This theory emphasizes the role of diversification to effectively manage risk and optimize returns in a portfolio of assets. The core principle of MPT is that an investor can look at risk and return simultaneously through statistical measures, allowing them to construct an "[efficient frontier](../e/efficient_frontier.md)" of optimal portfolios offering the maximum expected return for a given level of risk.

## Key Concepts of Markowitz Portfolio Theory

### 1. Expected Return
Expected return is the weighted average of the probable returns of the assets in a portfolio. The weights are the proportions of the total portfolio's value invested in each asset.

Formula:
\[ E(R_p) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i E(R_i) \]
Where:
- \(E(R_p)\) is the expected return of the portfolio,
- \(w_i\) is the proportion of the portfolio invested in asset \(i\),
- \(E(R_i)\) is the expected return of asset \(i\).

### 2. Risk (Variance and Standard Deviation)
Risk in MPT is primarily measured by the variance or standard deviation of returns. Variance measures the dispersion of the returns of an asset or portfolio, while standard deviation is the square root of variance, providing a measure of spread in the same unit as the returns.

Formula for portfolio variance:

\[ \sigma_p^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} w_i w_j \sigma_{ij} \]
Where:
- \(\sigma_p^2\) is the variance of the portfolio,
- \(w_i\) and \(w_j\) are the weights of the assets \(i\) and \(j\) in the portfolio,
- \(\sigma_{ij}\) is the covariance between the returns of assets \(i\) and \(j\).

Covariance measures how two assets move in relation to each other. A positive covariance means the assets move together, while a negative covariance means they move inversely.

### 3. Diversification
Diversification involves spreading investments across various assets to reduce risk. According to MPT, diversification lowers the portfolio's risk as the unsystematic risk of individual assets can be minimized.

### 4. Efficient Frontier
The [Efficient Frontier](../e/efficient_frontier.md) represents the set of portfolios that will provide the highest expected return for a given level of risk. Portfolios along this frontier are considered optimally diversified.

### 5. Capital Market Line (CML) and Security Market Line (SML)
The Capital Market Line extends the concept of the [Efficient Frontier](../e/efficient_frontier.md) to include a risk-free asset. It represents the portfolios that optimally combine risk and return when a risk-free asset is included. The Security Market Line, on the other hand, represents the expected return of an asset as a function of its beta with the [market portfolio](../m/market_portfolio.md) ([systematic risk](../s/systematic_risk.md)).

## Application of MPT in Algorithmic Trading
In [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), Markowitz Portfolio Theory can be used to automate the selection and rebalancing of portfolios to optimize returns for a given level of risk.
- **Automated Portfolio Construction**: Using MPT, algorithms can construct portfolios that are positioned on the [efficient frontier](../e/efficient_frontier.md), ensuring optimal diversification and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md).
- **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md) Algorithms**: By incorporating variance and covariance into algorithmic models, traders can better manage and mitigate risk.
- **[Rebalancing Algorithms](../r/rebalancing_algorithms.md)**: Automated systems can periodically adjust portfolio weights to maintain an optimal risk-return profile as market conditions change.

## Software and Tools Implementing MPT
Several financial software platforms and tools implement Markowitz Portfolio Theory, offering both individual and institutional investors tools to optimize their portfolios.

### Example Platforms:
- **[Kensho](https://www.s&pglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/campaigns/kensho)**: Provides comprehensive AI-driven analytics, including [portfolio optimization](../p/portfolio_optimization.md) using MPT.
- **[Portfolio Visualizer](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/)**: A robust tool for [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) and [portfolio optimization](../p/portfolio_optimization.md), incorporating MPT principles.
- **[QuantConnect](https://www.quantconnect.com/)**: Open-source platform that allows algorithmic traders to build, backtest and deploy algorithms, including those based on MPT.

## Advanced Considerations
### 1. Constraints in MPT
Practical portfolios might face constraints such as minimum/maximum investment levels, sector caps, and tax considerations. These real-world constraints can be incorporated into MPT by using techniques such as quadratic programming.

### 2. Inclusion of Alternative Assets
Beyond traditional equities and bonds, modern investors might include alternative assets such as real estate, commodities, and private equity. These assets often have different return distributions and correlations, which can be incorporated into MPT models to further enhance diversification.

### 3. Behavioral Factors
MPT assumes rational behavior and efficient markets. However, [behavioral finance](../b/behavioral_finance.md) highlights that investors often exhibit irrational behaviors and markets can be affected by sentiment. Incorporating behavioral factors into [portfolio optimization](../p/portfolio_optimization.md) is an evolving field seeking to address these limitations.

### 4. Dynamic Portfolio Allocation
Static portfolio allocation might not adapt well to changing market conditions. Dynamic [portfolio allocation models](../p/portfolio_allocation_models.md) adjust asset weights in response to market changes, macroeconomic indicators, and other variables, aiming to keep the portfolio on the [efficient frontier](../e/efficient_frontier.md) continuously.

## Critiques and Limitations
Markowitz Portfolio Theory, while fundamental, has been criticized and evolved over time. Some key critiques include:
- **Assumption of Normal Distribution of Returns**: MPT assumes returns are normally distributed, which may not hold true for all assets, especially in turbulent markets where tail risks are prominent.
- **Estimation Errors**: Estimating the inputs (expected returns, variances, and covariances) accurately is challenging and errors can lead to suboptimal portfolios.
- **Ignoring Higher Moments**: Traditional MPT only considers mean and variance, but higher moments of the return distribution like [skewness and kurtosis](../s/skewness_and_kurtosis.md) can also impact investment decisions.

## Conclusion
Markowitz Portfolio Theory has laid the foundation for modern investment strategies by introducing a structured approach to risk and return optimization through diversification. Despite its limitations and the evolving nature of financial markets, the principles of MPT remain integral to [portfolio management](../p/portfolio_management.md) and [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) strategies. Its applications and enhancements continue to evolve, incorporating new assets, methods, and behavioral insights, thus maintaining its relevance in the ever-advancing world of finance.

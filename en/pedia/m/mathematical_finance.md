# Mathematical Finance

Mathematical finance, also known as quantitative finance, is a field of applied mathematics concerned with the financial markets. It uses mathematical models and computational techniques to analyze financial markets, derive pricing models, manage risk, and optimize portfolios. Below are some critical areas covered under the umbrella of mathematical finance:

## 1. Financial Modeling

### 1.1 Black-Scholes Model
The Black-Scholes model is one of the most famous mathematical models for pricing options and other financial derivatives. It provides a theoretical estimate of the price of European-style options and is based on several assumptions including constant volatility and the log-normal distribution of stock prices.

#### The Black-Scholes Formula
\[
C(S, t) = S_0N(d_1) - Xe^{-rt}N(d_2)
\]
Where:
- \(d_1 = \frac{\ln(\frac{S_0}{X}) + (r + \frac{\sigma^2}{2})t}{\sigma\sqrt{t}}\)
- \(d_2 = d_1 - \sigma\sqrt{t}\)
- \(N(\cdot)\) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution
- \(S_0\) is the current stock price
- \(X\) is the strike price
- \(r\) is the risk-free interest rate
- \(\sigma\) is the volatility of the stock
- \(t\) is the time until the option's expiration

### 1.2 Binomial Option Pricing Model
The binomial option pricing model is another discrete-time model for pricing options. Unlike the Black-Scholes model, it uses a simple tree of possible future stock prices constructed iteratively. This model is particularly useful for American options where the holder has the right to exercise the option at any time before expiration.

#### The Binomial Formula
\[
C = \frac{1}{(1+r)^t} \left[ pC_u + (1-p)C_d \right]
\]
Where:
- \(p = \frac{e^{r\Delta t} - d}{u - d}\)
- \(u\) is the factor by which the price increases
- \(d\) is the factor by which the price decreases
- \(C_u\) and \(C_d\) are the option values at the respective nodes

## 2. Risk Management

### 2.1 Value at Risk (VaR)
Value at Risk is a statistical technique used to measure the risk of loss on a portfolio. This measure estimates the potential loss in value of a portfolio over a defined period for a given confidence interval. 

#### VaR Formula
\[
\text{VaR} = \Phi^{-1}(1 - \alpha) \cdot \sigma_P \cdot \sqrt{T}
\]
Where:
- \(\Phi^{-1}\) is the inverse of the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution
- \(\alpha\) is the confidence level
- \(\sigma_P\) is the portfolio's standard deviation
- \(T\) is the time horizon

### 2.2 Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)
Conditional Value at Risk, also known as Expected Shortfall, is a risk measure that provides an average of losses that occur beyond the VaR threshold. It is considered to be a more coherent measure of risk compared to VaR.

#### CVaR Formula
\[
\text{CVaR} = \mathbb{E}[L | L \geq \text{VaR}]
\]
Where:
- \(L\) is the loss distribution
- \(\mathbb{E}[\cdot]\) denotes the expected value

## 3. Portfolio Optimization

### 3.1 Mean-Variance Optimization
Introduced by Harry Markowitz in 1952, Mean-Variance Optimization is a quantitative tool used to construct portfolios that maximize return for a given level of risk. The efficient frontier represents the set of optimal portfolios.

#### Mean-Variance Optimization Formula
\[
\frac{\text{E}[R_P] - R_f}{\sigma_P}
\]
Where:
- \(E[R_P]\) is the expected return of the portfolio
- \(R_f\) is the risk-free rate
- \(\sigma_P\) is the standard deviation of portfolio return

### 3.2 Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
CAPM is a model used to determine the theoretical expected return on an asset based on its systematic risk. It is widely used to price risky securities and to calculate the cost of capital.

#### CAPM Formula
\[
E[R_i] = R_f + \beta_i (E[R_m] - R_f)
\]
Where:
- \(E[R_i]\) is the expected return of the asset
- \(R_f\) is the risk-free rate
- \(\beta_i\) is the beta of the asset
- \(E[R_m]\) is the expected return of the market

## 4. Time Series Analysis

### 4.1 Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
ARIMA models are used to understand and predict future points in a time series. They are particularly suited to datasets with trends and are characterized by parameters p, d, and q.

#### ARIMA Model
\[
ARIMA(p, d, q)
\]
Where:
- \(p\) is the number of lag observations included in the model
- \(d\) is the degree of differencing
- \(q\) is the size of the moving average window

### 4.2 Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH)
GARCH models are used to estimate the volatility of returns in financial markets. The model captures the time-varying volatility by including past variances and past errors.

#### GARCH Model
\[
\sigma_t^2 = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \epsilon_{t-1}^2 + \beta_1 \sigma_{t-1}^2
\]
Where:
- \(\sigma_t^2\) is the conditional variance
- \(\alpha_0\), \(\alpha_1\), \(\beta_1\) are the coefficients
- \(\epsilon_{t-1}^2\) is the lagged squared residual

## 5. Stochastic Calculus

### 5.1 Itô's Lemma
Itô's Lemma is a fundamental result in stochastic calculus, which is used to determine the differential of a function of a stochastic process. It is particularly useful for option pricing.

#### Itô's Lemma
If \(X_t\) is a function of a stochastic process \(Y_t\), then:
\[
dX_t = \left( \frac{\partial X}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial X}{\partial Y} \mu_t + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2 X}{\partial Y^2} \sigma_t^2 \right) dt + \frac{\partial X}{\partial Y} \sigma_t dW_t
\]
Where:
- \(\mu_t\) and \(\sigma_t\) are the drift and volatility
- \(dW_t\) is the Wiener process

### 5.2 Martingales
A martingale is a stochastic process that represents a fair game, where the conditional expectation of the next value, given all previous values, is equal to the present value.

#### Martingale Definition
\[
\mathbb{E}[X_{t+1} | \mathcal{F}_t] = X_t
\]
Where:
- \(\mathcal{F}_t\) is the filtration or information up to time \(t\)
- \(X_t\) is the value of the process at time \(t\)

## 6. Computational Methods

### 6.1 Monte Carlo Simulation
Monte Carlo Simulation is a computational algorithm that uses repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. It is widely used in finance to model the probability of different outcomes.

#### Monte Carlo Steps:
1. Define a domain of possible inputs
2. Generate random inputs
3. Perform a deterministic computation on the inputs
4. Aggregate the results

### 6.2 Finite Difference Methods
Finite difference methods are numerical techniques for solving differential equations by approximating them with difference equations. They are often used to solve the Black-Scholes PDE.

#### Finite Difference Scheme:
- Explicit scheme
- Implicit scheme
- Crank-Nicolson scheme

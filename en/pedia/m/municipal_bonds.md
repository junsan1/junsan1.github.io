# Municipal Bonds

**Introduction to Municipal Bonds**

Municipal bonds, often referred to as "munis," are [debt](../d/debt.md) securities issued by states, municipalities, or counties to [finance](../f/finance.md) their [capital](../c/capital.md) expenditures, including [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) projects like building schools, highways, or water and sewer systems. These bonds [offer](../o/offer.md) a way for governmental entities to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) for public use. One of the key features of municipal bonds is that they are often exempt from [federal income](../f/federal_income.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) and sometimes even state and local [taxes](../t/taxes.md) if the [investor](../i/investor.md) resides in the state where the [bond](../b/bond.md) is issued, making them attractive to taxable investors.

**Types of Municipal Bonds**

1. **General Obligation Bonds (GOs):**
   General Obligation bonds are not backed by [revenue](../r/revenue.md) from a specific project. Instead, they are secured by the full faith and [credit](../c/credit.md) of the issuing municipality, which often has the power to tax residents to pay bondholders. These types of bonds are considered lower [risk](../r/risk.md) because they are backed by the [issuer](../i/issuer.md)'s overall taxing power.
   
2. **[Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Bonds:**
   [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) bonds are supported by the [income](../i/income.md) generated from a specific project or source, such as tolls from a toll road or fees from a municipal [utility](../u/utility.md). These bonds carry more [risk](../r/risk.md) than GOs because their [repayment](../r/repayment.md) is dependent on the [revenue](../r/revenue.md)-generating capability of the project funded by the bonds.

3. **Assessment Bonds:**
   These are secured by property [taxes](../t/taxes.md) from properties that benefit from the improvement funded by the bonds, such as street lighting or sewer systems. Property owners within the benefited area are assessed a [fee](../f/fee.md) to repay the bonds.

4. **Tax Anticipation Notes (TANs) & [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Anticipation Notes (RANs):**
   These are short-term municipal notes issued in anticipation of future tax collections or [revenue](../r/revenue.md) [receipts](../r/receipt.md). They are used to [finance](../f/finance.md) immediate needs in anticipation of [revenue](../r/revenue.md) that [will](../w/will.md) be received in the near future.

**Benefits of Municipal Bonds**

- **Tax Advantages:** One of the most significant benefits is the potential for [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md) [income](../i/income.md) at the federal and possibly state and local levels.
- **Low [Default](../d/default.md) Rates:** Historically, municipal bonds have had low [default](../d/default.md) rates in comparison to corporate bonds. This makes them a relatively safe investment.
- **Diverse Issuers:** With a vast variety of issuers ranging from local municipalities to large state governments, investors have a broad [range](../r/range.md) of [options](../o/options.md) to diversify their portfolios.

**Risks Associated with Municipal Bonds**

- **[Credit Risk](../c/credit_risk.md):** The possibility that the [bond](../b/bond.md) [issuer](../i/issuer.md) might [default](../d/default.md) on payments. This can be evaluated by checking the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md).
- **[Interest Rate Risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md):** Changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates can affect the [market value](../m/market_value.md) of existing bonds. If rates rise, the [value](../v/value.md) of existing bonds may fall.
- **[Market Risk](../m/market_risk.md):** [Economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md) and events can impact the [demand](../d/demand.md) for municipal bonds, thereby affecting their prices and yields.
- **Call [Risk](../r/risk.md):** Some municipal bonds are callable, meaning the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) can repay them before [maturity](../m/maturity.md), which can affect the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md).
- **[Liquidity Risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md):** Some municipal bonds may not be easily tradable in the [market](../m/market.md), making it difficult to sell them promptly without impacting the price.

**[Market](../m/market.md) and Trading of Municipal Bonds**

Municipal bonds are predominantly traded over-the-counter (OTC) rather than on exchanges. Key platforms supporting [municipal bond trading](../m/municipal_bond_trading.md) and pricing include:
- **Electronic Municipal [Market](../m/market.md) Access (EMMA):** Managed by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB), EMMA provides [market](../m/market.md) [transparency](../t/transparency.md) by [offering](../o/offering.md) free public access to municipal securities trading data, official disclosures, and educational materials.

**[Rating](../r/rating.md) Agencies and Their Role**

[Credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) agencies play a vital role in assessing the [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) of [municipal bond](../m/municipal_bond.md) issuers. The major [rating](../r/rating.md) agencies include Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s (S&P), and [Fitch Ratings](../f/fitch_ratings.md). They evaluate the [issuer](../i/issuer.md)'s [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and the specific project linked to the [bond](../b/bond.md). These ratings help investors understand the [risk](../r/risk.md) level associated with the bonds.

**Important Considerations for Investors**

When evaluating municipal bonds, investors should consider factors such as the [issuer](../i/issuer.md)'s [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md), the [bond](../b/bond.md)’s [maturity](../m/maturity.md), [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) environment, and any call provisions. Additionally, understanding the specific [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and economic prospects of the issuing municipality can provide insights into the [security](../s/security.md) of the investment.

**[Municipal Bond](../m/municipal_bond.md) Funds**

Investors who seek [diversification](../d/diversification.md) and professionally managed portfolios might consider [municipal bond](../m/municipal_bond.md) funds. These funds pool investments from [multiple](../m/multiple.md) investors to buy a diversified portfolio of municipal bonds, potentially reducing [risk](../r/risk.md) compared to holding individual bonds.

**Conclusion**

Municipal bonds represent an essential component of the [fixed income](../f/fixed_income.md) [market](../m/market.md), providing both communities with necessary funding and investors with relatively safe, [tax-advantaged](../t/tax-advantaged.md) returns. As with all investments, [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md) and understanding the associated risks and benefits are key to making informed investment decisions.

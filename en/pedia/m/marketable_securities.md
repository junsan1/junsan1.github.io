# Marketable Securities

Marketable securities are [liquid](../l/liquid.md) financial instruments that can be quickly converted into cash at a reasonable price. They possess a significant degree of [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) due to their short-term maturities and the ability to be easily traded on public exchanges. This document [will](../w/will.md) delve into different types of marketable securities, their characteristics, benefits, and risks, as well as their role in [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md) and investment portfolios.

## Types of Marketable Securities

Marketable securities can be broadly classified into two categories: [debt](../d/debt.md) securities and [equity](../e/equity.md) securities.

### Debt Securities

[Debt](../d/debt.md) securities are financial instruments that represent a [creditor](../c/creditor.md) relationship with an entity, typically involving a form of borrowing. Examples include:

#### 1. Treasury Bills (T-Bills)

Treasury Bills are [short-term debt](../s/short-term_debt.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md) issued by the U.S. government with maturities ranging from a few days to 52 weeks. They are considered [risk](../r/risk.md)-free as they are backed by the full faith and [credit](../c/credit.md) of the U.S. government.

#### 2. Commercial Paper

[Commercial paper](../c/commercial_paper.md) is an unsecured, short-term [debt instrument](../d/debt_instrument.md) issued by corporations to [finance](../f/finance.md) their short-term liabilities. It typically has maturities of up to 270 days. 

#### 3. Certificates of Deposit (CDs)

Certificates of [Deposit](../d/deposit.md) are [deposit](../d/deposit.md) [receipts](../r/receipt.md) issued by banks with specific [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and [maturity](../m/maturity.md) dates. They are generally considered low-[risk](../r/risk.md) investments.

#### 4. Corporate Bonds

Corporate bonds are [debt](../d/debt.md) securities issued by corporations to raise funds for various purposes. Although they can vary in [maturity](../m/maturity.md), corporate bonds classified as marketable securities generally have shorter terms.

### Equity Securities

[Equity](../e/equity.md) securities represent ownership [interest](../i/interest.md) in a [corporation](../c/corporation.md). Examples include:

#### 1. Common Stock

[Common stock](../c/common_stock.md) represents ownership in a [corporation](../c/corporation.md) and entitles the holder to vote on corporate matters and receive dividends. It is the most common form of marketable [equity](../e/equity.md) [security](../s/security.md).

#### 2. Preferred Stock

[Preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md) has features of both [equity](../e/equity.md) and [debt](../d/debt.md) securities. Preferred shareholders have a higher claim on assets and [earnings](../e/earnings.md) than common shareholders and typically receive fixed dividends.

## Characteristics of Marketable Securities

Marketable securities are characterized by several key attributes:

### Liquidity

[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) refers to the ease with which an [asset](../a/asset.md) can be converted into cash. Marketable securities are highly [liquid](../l/liquid.md) because they are actively traded on public exchanges, making it easy to buy and sell them at [market](../m/market.md) prices.

### Short-Term Maturity

Marketable [debt](../d/debt.md) securities often have short-term [maturity](../m/maturity.md) dates, usually less than one year. This short-term nature minimizes the [risk](../r/risk.md) of significant price fluctuations and ensures that they can be quickly liquidated without substantial loss of [value](../v/value.md).

### Low Risk

Marketable securities, particularly government-issued [debt](../d/debt.md) securities, are generally low [risk](../r/risk.md). The short [maturity](../m/maturity.md) periods reduce the exposure to [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) changes and other [market](../m/market.md) risks.

### Marketability

Being traded on public exchanges, marketable securities are easily accessible to investors. This marketability ensures that there is always a ready [market](../m/market.md) for these securities, facilitating quick and efficient transactions.

## Benefits of Marketable Securities

Investors can enjoy several advantages from holding marketable securities:

### Liquidity Management

Marketable securities provide [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) management benefits, allowing investors to quickly convert investments into cash to meet short-term financial needs or take advantage of other investment opportunities.

### Diversification

Including marketable securities in an investment portfolio can provide [diversification benefits](../d/diversification_benefits.md). This is crucial for managing [risk](../r/risk.md) and achieving a [balanced investment strategy](../b/balanced_investment_strategy.md).

### Income Generation

Many marketable securities [offer](../o/offer.md) regular [income](../i/income.md) in the form of [interest](../i/interest.md) payments (for [debt](../d/debt.md) securities) or dividends (for [equity](../e/equity.md) securities). This [income](../i/income.md) can be a reliable source of returns for investors.

### Capital Preservation

Due to their low-[risk](../r/risk.md) nature and short-term maturities, marketable securities are a good option for [capital preservation](../c/capital_preservation.md). They help in safeguarding the [principal](../p/principal.md) amount while still [offering](../o/offering.md) modest returns.

### Flexible Investment Options

Marketable securities come in various forms, allowing investors to choose [options](../o/options.md) that best fit their [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md), [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md), and financial goals.

## Risks Associated with Marketable Securities

While marketable securities [offer](../o/offer.md) numerous benefits, they are not without risks. Investors should be aware of the following potential risks:

### Interest Rate Risk

[Interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md) is the potential for investment losses due to changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. For example, when [interest](../i/interest.md) rates rise, the [value](../v/value.md) of existing [debt](../d/debt.md) securities may fall, as new securities are likely to [offer](../o/offer.md) higher yields.

### Credit Risk

[Credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) is the [risk](../r/risk.md) of loss due to the [issuer](../i/issuer.md)'s inability to meet its financial [obligations](../o/obligation.md). While government bonds are typically low [risk](../r/risk.md), corporate bonds and commercial papers carry varying degrees of [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) depending on the [issuer](../i/issuer.md)'s financial stability.

### Market Risk

[Market risk](../m/market_risk.md) refers to the potential for investment losses due to fluctuations in the overall [market](../m/market.md). For [equity](../e/equity.md) securities, [market](../m/market.md) conditions, [investor](../i/investor.md) sentiment, and economic factors can all affect stock prices.

### Inflation Risk

[Inflation](../i/inflation.md) [risk](../r/risk.md) is the danger that the [return](../r/return.md) on an investment [will](../w/will.md) not keep pace with [inflation](../i/inflation.md), eroding the [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) of the returns.

## Valuation of Marketable Securities

The [valuation](../v/valuation.md) of marketable securities is crucial for investment decisions. Different securities are valued using different methods:

### Debt Securities Valuation

#### 1. Present Value of Future Cash Flows

The [value](../v/value.md) of [debt](../d/debt.md) securities is often determined by calculating the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of future cash flows, including [interest](../i/interest.md) payments and the [repayment](../r/repayment.md) of [principal](../p/principal.md).

#### 2. Yield to Maturity (YTM)

[Yield to Maturity](../y/yield_to_maturity.md) is the [total return](../t/total_return.md) anticipated on a [bond](../b/bond.md) if it is held until it matures. It is used to compare different [debt](../d/debt.md) securities with varying maturities and coupon rates.

### Equity Securities Valuation

#### 1. Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio)

The P/E ratio is a common measure that compares a company's current stock price to its [earnings](../e/earnings.md) per share (EPS). It helps investors determine the [relative value](../r/relative_value.md) of a company's [shares](../s/shares.md).

#### 2. Dividend Discount Model (DDM)

The [Dividend](../d/dividend.md) [Discount](../d/discount.md) Model values a stock by predicting the dividends it [will](../w/will.md) pay and [discounting](../d/discounting.md) them back to their [present value](../p/present_value.md). It is particularly useful for valuing companies with stable [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payouts.

## Role of Marketable Securities in Financial Planning

Marketable securities play a vital role in [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md) and investment strategies:

### Emergency Funds

Marketable securities like T-bills and CDs can serve as emergency funds due to their [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and low [risk](../r/risk.md). They provide quick access to cash in times of financial emergencies.

### Portfolio Balance

Incorporating marketable securities helps balance a portfolio, providing stability and reducing overall [risk](../r/risk.md). They [complement](../c/complement.md) other investment types, such as long-term bonds and [stocks](../s/stock.md), to create a well-rounded portfolio.

### Short-Term Investments

For investors looking to park funds for a short period, marketable securities [offer](../o/offer.md) a suitable investment option. They provide returns without committing to [long-term investments](../l/long-term_investments.md).

### Cash Management

Corporations and institutional investors use marketable securities for [cash management](../c/cash_management.md) purposes, ensuring they have sufficient [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) to meet operational and other financial [obligations](../o/obligation.md).

## Notable Companies Offering Marketable Securities

Several prominent financial institutions and companies [offer](../o/offer.md) a variety of marketable securities. Here are a few examples:

# Mortgage Originator

A mortgage originator is an entity or individual that works with a borrower to complete a mortgage transaction—from application through funding—typically for the purchase of real estate. The mortgage originator is responsible for guiding the borrower through the entire mortgage process, ensuring that all necessary documentation is completed and submitted while acting as the liaison between the borrower and the lending entity. Mortgage originators can be banks, credit unions, mortgage companies, or individual brokers.

### Underwriting

- **Follow-Up**: Act as a point of contact for any additional information or documentation needed by the underwriter.

### Approval and Closing
- **Loan Approval**: Inform the borrower of loan approval status and explain the terms of the approval.
- **Loan Processing**: Ensure all conditions of the approval are met and that the loan file is complete for processing.
- **Coordinate Closing**: Arrange for final loan documents to be signed and coordinate with title companies, attorneys, and real estate agents to facilitate a smooth closing.

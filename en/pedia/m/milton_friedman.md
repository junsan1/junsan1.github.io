# Milton Friedman

Milton Friedman was an American [economist](../e/economist.md) and statistician who received the 1976 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his research on consumption analysis, monetary history and theory, and the complexity of stabilization policy. He was both a prolific and influential scholar and a public intellectual who shaped economic thought and policy throughout the latter half of the twentieth century.

## Early Life and Education 

Milton Friedman was born on July 31, 1912, in Brooklyn, New York, to Jewish immigrants from Hungary. He attended Rutgers University and studied mathematics, after which he earned a master's degree in 1933 from the University of Chicago. He later completed his Ph.D. at Columbia University in 1946.

## Academic Career

Friedman's academic career began at the University of Chicago where he joined the faculty in the Department of [Economics](../e/economics.md). It was during his time here that he conducted much of his most influential research and became a leading figure in the "Chicago School" of [economics](../e/economics.md). This school of thought emphasized free-[market](../m/market.md) principles, a limited role for the government, and was highly skeptical of [Keynesian economics](../k/keynesian_economics_in_trading.md).

### Contributions to Economics

#### Permanent Income Hypothesis

One of Friedman’s major contributions to economic theory was the [Permanent Income Hypothesis](../p/permanent_income_hypothesis.md), which he first proposed in 1957. This theory postulates that an individual's consumption choices are not solely determined by current [income](../i/income.md) but by a longer-term estimate of their [income](../i/income.md). It directly challenges Keynesian consumption functions by suggesting that people plan their consumption based on expected future [income](../i/income.md), not just current [income](../i/income.md).

#### Monetary Policy

Friedman was a strong advocate for the role of [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) in controlling [inflation](../i/inflation.md) and economic stability. His work in this area was compiled in the influential book *A Monetary History of the United States*, co-authored with Anna J. Schwartz in 1963. They argued that changes in the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) have significant and predictable effects on national output in the [short run](../s/short_run.md) and the [price level](../p/price_level.md) in the [long run](../l/long_run.md).

#### Natural Rate of Unemployment

In the context of labor [economics](../e/economics.md), Friedman introduced the concept of the “natural rate of [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md).” He posited that there is a specific rate of [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) that is inherent in an [economy](../e/economy.md) at any given time because of various factors like [market](../m/market.md) imperfections, information asymmetry, and changing worker and employer demands. According to Friedman, attempts to reduce [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) below this natural rate could trigger accelerating [inflation](../i/inflation.md), a key argument against prolonged use of expansionary fiscal policies.

## Public Intellectual

Beyond academia, Friedman was a prolific [writer](../w/writer.md) and commentator on public policy. He wrote numerous articles and appeared in various media, including the PBS television series “Free To Choose” which he co-hosted with his wife, Rose Friedman. The series and the corresponding book of the same name were instrumental in popularizing free-[market](../m/market.md) ideas among the general public.

### Policy Advocacy

#### Free Markets and Deregulation

Friedman was a staunch advocate of free markets and argued that minimal government intervention in the [economy](../e/economy.md) is beneficial. He supported [deregulation](../d/deregulation.md) across various sectors, including aviation and telecommunications, believing that competition fosters innovation and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md).

#### School Vouchers and Education

Friedman was ahead of his time in proposing school vouchers, which allow parents to use public funding for private or parochial schooling. He believed this system would introduce competition among schools, thereby improving overall educational standards.

## Impact and Legacy

Milton Friedman’s work left a lasting impact on economic policy and theory. His advocacy for [monetarism](../m/monetarism.md) influenced central banks, including the Federal Reserve, to focus on controlling [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) as a primary means of stabilizing the [economy](../e/economy.md). His ideas on free-[market](../m/market.md) policies and reducing government intervention inspired policymakers globally, including Ronald Reagan in the United States and Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom.

### Criticisms

While widely celebrated, Friedman’s ideas were not without criticism. Some economists and policymakers argued that his unconditional support for free markets failed to account for [market](../m/market.md) failures and social inequities. Critics also contended that his approach to [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) was too rigid, particularly in periods requiring active fiscal measures.

### Continuing Influence

Even after his death in 2006, Friedman’s ideas continue to be influential. His legacy can be seen in ongoing debates about economic policy, the role of central banks, and the benefits and drawbacks of [deregulation](../d/deregulation.md). Institutions such as the Hoover Institution at Stanford University continue to honor his memory and work.

## Conclusion

Milton Friedman remains one of the most influential economists of the twentieth century. His groundbreaking theories, strong advocacy for free markets, and enduring public presence have cemented his place in the historical narrative of economic thought. His ideas continue to generate discussion and guide policymaking in various aspects of modern [economics](../e/economics.md).

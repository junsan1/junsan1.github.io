# Market Failure

[Market](../m/market.md) failure is a situation in which the allocation of goods and services by a [free market](../f/free_market.md) is not efficient. That is, there exists another conceivable outcome where a [market](../m/market.md) participant can be made better-off without making someone else worse-off. [Market](../m/market.md) failures can be viewed as scenarios where individuals' pursuit of pure self-[interest](../i/interest.md) leads to results that are not efficient — that can be improved upon from the societal point of view.

## Types of Market Failure

[Market](../m/market.md) failures can broadly be categorized into several different types. Each type represents a specific way in which the [market](../m/market.md) can [fail](../f/fail.md) to achieve efficient outcomes.

### Public Goods

Public goods are non-excludable and non-rivalrous. This means that it's impossible to prevent someone from using the good, and one person's use of the good does not diminish others' use of it. Examples include national defense, public parks, and clean air.

- **Non-Excludability**: Cannot prevent people from accessing the good.
- **Non-Rivalrous Consumption**: One person's use does not diminish another's.

Public goods often lead to the "[free rider problem](../f/free_rider_problem.md)," where individuals have no incentive to pay for the good because they [will](../w/will.md) receive the benefit whether they pay or not.

### Externalities

Externalities occur when a [third party](../t/third_party.md) is affected by the economic activities of others. They can be either positive or negative.

- **Negative Externalities**: These occur when the actions of individuals or businesses impose costs on others, such as pollution from a factory affecting the health of nearby residents.
- **Positive Externalities**: These occur when the actions of individuals or businesses confer benefits on others, such as a homeowner’s well-maintained garden adding aesthetic [value](../v/value.md) to the neighborhood.

Externalities cause a [divergence](../d/divergence.md) between private and social costs or benefits, leading to suboptimal [market](../m/market.md) outcomes. For instance, in the case of negative externalities, the good is often overproduced and priced too low, while goods with positive externalities are underproduced and priced too high.

### Monopoly Power

Monopolies or firms with significant [market power](../m/market_power.md) can restrict output and increase prices to maximize profits, leading to allocative inefficiency where the price of the good exceeds its marginal cost. This can result in a loss of consumer [welfare](../w/welfare.md) and potentially reduction in total social [welfare](../w/welfare.md).

### Information Asymmetry

Information asymmetry occurs when one party in a [transaction](../t/transaction.md) has more or better information compared to the other. This can lead to [adverse selection](../a/adverse_selection.md) and [moral hazard](../m/moral_hazard.md).

- **[Adverse Selection](../a/adverse_selection.md)**: Occurs when buyers and sellers have different information, leading to transactions where one party can exploit the other. For example, in the [market](../m/market.md) for used cars, sellers typically have more information about the vehicle's condition, leading to the [sale](../s/sale.md) of 'lemons' or lower-quality cars at prices reflecting the average quality of the pool, thus driving away good-quality cars.
- **[Moral Hazard](../m/moral_hazard.md)**: Arises when one party takes on more [risk](../r/risk.md) because they do not bear the full consequences of that [risk](../r/risk.md). For example, if banks believe they [will](../w/will.md) be bailed out by the government if their investments [fail](../f/fail.md), they may take on excessive [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Inequality and Equity Issues

Markets may distribute resources in ways that are perceived as unfair or inequitable. While economic theory often focuses on [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md), societal values may also place great importance on the equitable [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of goods and services. For instance, access to healthcare or education may be considered a right, and markets that do not provide these equitably may be seen as failing.

## Causes of Market Failure

Various factors can cause [market](../m/market.md) failure, including but not limited to the inherent characteristics of goods and services, externalities, [market](../m/market.md) structures, and information problems.

### Inherent Characteristics of Goods and Services

Some goods and services naturally tend to be public goods or possess characteristics that lead to [market](../m/market.md) failures, such as non-excludability or non-rivalry.

### Externalities

Externalities can be inherent to the production and consumption of certain goods. For instance, industrial production processes might naturally result in pollution.

### Market Structures

[Market](../m/market.md) structures, such as monopolies, oligopolies, or [monopolistic competition](../m/monopolistic_competition.md), can result in non-competitive practices that distort [market](../m/market.md) outcomes.

### Information Problems

Markets function optimally when participants have access to full and accurate information, but information asymmetry is common and can be a significant cause of [market](../m/market.md) failure. 

## Government Intervention and Policy Responses

Governments often step in to correct [market](../m/market.md) failures through various mechanisms, including:

### Regulation

Governments can impose regulations to control negative externalities and monopolistic practices. For example, pollution standards can be set to reduce environmental degradation.

### Subsidies and Taxes

Subsidies can encourage the production and consumption of goods with positive externalities. Conversely, [taxes](../t/taxes.md) can discourage activities that generate negative externalities.

### Public Provisioning

In cases of public goods, the government might directly provide these goods, such as national defense, public parks, or subsidized education.

### Information Disclosure and Standards

Regulations requiring [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) of information can help to correct information asymmetries. For instance, truth-in-lending laws require lenders to disclose all terms and costs associated with a [loan](../l/loan.md).

### Antitrust Laws

Governments can enforce [antitrust](../a/antitrust.md) laws to prevent monopolistic practices and promote competitive markets. [Antitrust](../a/antitrust.md) interventions may include breaking up large firms, prohibiting mergers that reduce competition, or preventing [predatory pricing](../p/predatory_pricing.md).

## Real-World Examples of Market Failure

### Environmental Pollution

Pollution is a classic example of a negative [externality](../e/externality.md). Factories emitting pollutants into the air or water do not typically bear the full costs of their actions, which can result in significant harm to the environment and public health. Governments around the world have tried to address this through regulations like the Clean Air Act in the United States or the Carbon Trading Schemes in Europe.

### Healthcare

The healthcare [market](../m/market.md) often suffers from information asymmetry, leading to [adverse selection](../a/adverse_selection.md) and [moral hazard](../m/moral_hazard.md). Patients may lack information about the quality of care they receive, leading to choices that do not maximize health outcomes.

### Financial Markets

[Financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) are prone to various types of [market](../m/market.md) failure, including information asymmetry and externalities. The 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) can be viewed through the lens of [market](../m/market.md) failure, with excessive [risk](../r/risk.md)-taking by financial institutions leading to a massive negative [externality](../e/externality.md) for the global [economy](../e/economy.md). Regulatory responses included measures like the Dodd-Frank Act in the United States, aimed at improving [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and reducing [systemic risk](../s/systemic_risk.md).

### Education

Education exhibits characteristics of a [public good](../p/public_good.md) in many respects and can lead to positive externalities such as a more informed citizenry and higher levels of civic engagement. Insufficient public investment can lead to underprovision of education, which is why many governments provide or subsidize public education.

## Conclusion

[Market](../m/market.md) failures represent situations where unregulated markets [fail](../f/fail.md) to allocate resources efficiently or equitably, leading to outcomes that are suboptimal from a societal perspective. Understanding the different types of [market](../m/market.md) failure, their causes, and potential policy responses is crucial for formulated effective regulations and interventions aimed at improving societal [welfare](../w/welfare.md).

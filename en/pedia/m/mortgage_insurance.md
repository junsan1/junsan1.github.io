# Mortgage Insurance

[Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [insurance](../i/insurance.md) is a financial product that protects lenders in case a borrower defaults on their [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md). It is typically required for borrowers who put down a lower [down payment](../d/down_payment.md), usually less than 20% of the [home](../h/home.md)'s purchase price. [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [insurance](../i/insurance.md) allows borrowers with less initial [capital](../c/capital.md) to access homeownership while providing lenders with a safety net.

## Types of Mortgage Insurance

### Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI)
Private [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [Insurance](../i/insurance.md), commonly referred to as PMI, is typically required for conventional loans when the [down payment](../d/down_payment.md) is less than 20%. It is provided by private [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies. PMI can be paid monthly, in a single upfront [premium](../p/premium.md), or as a combination of both.

### Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Mortgage Insurance
FHA loans require [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [insurance](../i/insurance.md) premiums (MIP) for all borrowers, irrespective of the [down payment](../d/down_payment.md) amount. FHA [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [insurance](../i/insurance.md) comprises two components: an upfront [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [insurance premium](../i/insurance_premium.md) (UFMIP) and an annual [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [insurance premium](../i/insurance_premium.md).

### Veterans Affairs (VA) Loan Mortgage Insurance
VA loans, available to veterans, military members, and certain members of the National Guard and Reserves, do not require traditional [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [insurance](../i/insurance.md). Instead, they have a funding [fee](../f/fee.md) that can be rolled into the [loan](../l/loan.md). This funding [fee](../f/fee.md) serves a similar purpose to [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [insurance](../i/insurance.md).

### United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Loan Mortgage Insurance
USDA loans, aimed at rural property buyers, require a guarantee [fee](../f/fee.md). This [fee](../f/fee.md) is split into an upfront [fee](../f/fee.md) and an annual [fee](../f/fee.md) that serves a similar purpose to PMI.

## Key Components of Mortgage Insurance

### Coverage Percentage
The coverage percentage is the portion of the [loan](../l/loan.md) amount that the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [insurance](../i/insurance.md) [will](../w/will.md) cover in the event of a [default](../d/default.md). For example, a 30% coverage would mean the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) [will](../w/will.md) cover 30% of the outstanding [loan](../l/loan.md) balance.

### Premiums
Premiums can be structured in various ways:
- **Monthly Premiums**: Included in the monthly [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [payment](../p/payment.md).
- **Upfront Premiums**: Paid at closing or financed into the [loan](../l/loan.md).
- **Split Premiums**: A combination of both monthly and upfront premiums.

### Cost Factors
The cost of [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [insurance](../i/insurance.md) can depend on several factors, including:
- [Loan](../l/loan.md)-to-[Value](../v/value.md) (LTV) ratio
- [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) term lengths
- Borrower's [credit score](../c/credit_score.md)
- [Loan](../l/loan.md) type

## Benefits and Drawbacks

### Benefits
- **Lower Down Payments**: Enables borrowers to purchase homes with down payments as low as 3-5%.
- **Access to Homeownership**: Facilitates homeownership for those who may not have significant [capital](../c/capital.md).
- **[Lender](../l/lender.md) Protection**: Provides a safety net to lenders, encouraging them to approve more loans.

### Drawbacks
- **Additional Costs**: Adds to the monthly housing [payment](../p/payment.md).
- **Non-Tax Deductibility**: In some cases, [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [insurance](../i/insurance.md) premiums are not tax-deductible.
- **Cancellation Complexity**: PMI needs to be canceled manually once the borrower reaches sufficient [equity](../e/equity.md).

## Cancellation of Mortgage Insurance

### Automatic Termination
PMI is automatically terminated when the borrower reaches 22% [equity](../e/equity.md) in the [home](../h/home.md), assuming all payments are current. FHA [loan](../l/loan.md) [insurance](../i/insurance.md), on the other hand, cannot be automatically canceled if the [loan](../l/loan.md) term exceeds 15 years unless it was originated after June 3, 2013, with an LTV ratio of 90% or less.

### Borrower Requested Termination
Borrowers can also request cancellation of PMI when they reach 20% [equity](../e/equity.md) in the [home](../h/home.md). Lenders require a formal [appraisal](../a/appraisal.md) to validate the [home](../h/home.md)'s current [value](../v/value.md).

## Regulatory Aspects

### Homeowners Protection Act (HPA)
The HPA mandates automatic termination and borrower-requested cancellation of PMI. Lenders must provide specific disclosures about PMI cancellation and termination. 

### Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)
The CFPB offers guidelines and consumer protection regulations surrounding [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [insurance](../i/insurance.md), ensuring [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and fair practices for borrowers.

## Alternatives to Mortgage Insurance

### Piggyback Loans
A piggyback [loan](../l/loan.md) is a second [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) taken concurrently with the first. For example, an 80-10-10 [loan](../l/loan.md) involves an 80% primary [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md), a 10% piggyback [loan](../l/loan.md), and a 10% [down payment](../d/down_payment.md). This strategy bypasses PMI but involves higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates for the second [loan](../l/loan.md).

### Lender-Paid Mortgage Insurance (LPMI)
In LPMI, the [lender](../l/lender.md) pays the [insurance premium](../i/insurance_premium.md) and incorporates it into the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md), resulting in a slightly higher [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) for the borrower.

### Increased Down Payment
Choosing to save for a larger [down payment](../d/down_payment.md) can eliminate the need for [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [insurance](../i/insurance.md) altogether. A 20% [down payment](../d/down_payment.md) is the standard [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md).

# Mongolian Stock Exchange (MSE)

The Mongolian Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (MSE), located in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, stands as one of the world's least-known stock exchanges but is an essential part of the country's financial [market](../m/market.md) [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md). Established in 1991, shortly after Mongolia's transition to a [market economy](../m/market_economy.md), it has grown significantly over the years, despite the challenges that come with a relatively small and developing financial [market](../m/market.md).

## Historical Background

The MSE was founded on January 18, 1991, as a [joint-stock company](../j/joint-stock_company.md) between the government and private entities. The establishment was part of the broader economic reforms aimed at transitioning Mongolia from a [centrally planned economy](../c/centrally_planned_economy.md) to a free-[market](../m/market.md) system. These reforms were a response to the collapse of the Soviet Union, which had previously been Mongolia's main economic partner.

Initially, the MSE was launched to facilitate the [privatization](../p/privatization.md) of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The government issued vouchers to citizens that could be used to purchase [shares](../s/shares.md) in these privatized entities, effectively laying the groundwork for a [stock market](../s/stock_market.md). The [voucher](../v/voucher.md) [privatization](../p/privatization.md) program was relatively unique and served as a model for other transitioning economies.

## Market Structure

### Trading Platform

The Mongolian Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) operates through a fully electronic trading system known as "Millennium IT," which was adopted in 2012. This system is similar to those used by many advanced markets and enables the MSE to [handle](../h/handle.md) high-speed, high-[volume](../v/volume.md) trading efficiently. The platform supports various [asset](../a/asset.md) classes, including equities, bonds, and [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md).

1. **MSE Top 20 [Index](../i/index_instrument.md)**: It tracks the performance of the top 20 most [liquid](../l/liquid.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) on the [exchange](../e/exchange.md).

## Regulatory Environment

The Mongolian Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) is regulated primarily by the Financial Regulatory [Commission](../c/commission.md) of Mongolia (FRC). The FRC is responsible for maintaining [market](../m/market.md) integrity, ensuring [transparency](../t/transparency.md), and protecting [investor](../i/investor.md) interests. It imposes rigorous [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) requirements and governance standards on [listed](../l/listed.md) companies to ensure that the [market](../m/market.md) operates fairly and efficiently.

The legal framework governing the MSE includes the Securities [Market](../m/market.md) Law, the Company Law, and various regulations and directives issued by the FRC. These regulations are continually updated to align with international [best practices](../b/best_practices.md) and to address emerging [market](../m/market.md) trends and challenges.

3. **Economic [Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: Mongolia's [economy](../e/economy.md) is highly dependent on commodities, particularly [mining](../m/mining.md), making it susceptible to global price fluctuations and [economic cycles](../e/economic_cycles.md).
4. **[Infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md)**: Despite advancements, there is still room for improvement in [market](../m/market.md) [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md), particularly in areas like [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) and [investor](../i/investor.md) protection.

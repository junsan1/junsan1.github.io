# Michael Milken

Michael Milken is a polarizing figure in American [finance](../f/finance.md), renowned for his pioneering work in the [high-yield bond](../h/high-yield_bond.md) [market](../m/market.md) during the 1980s and subsequently for his philanthropic endeavors and [leadership](../l/leadership.md) at the Milken Institute. This article delves into Milken's multifaceted career, exploring his contributions to [finance](../f/finance.md), the controversies that overshadowed his achievements, and his later dedication to [philanthropy](../p/philanthropy.md) and economic research.

## Early Life and Education

Born in Encino, California, in 1946, Michael Milken demonstrated an early aptitude for academics and [finance](../f/finance.md). He attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned a Bachelor of Science with honors, and later went on to obtain his MBA from the [Wharton School](../w/wharton_school.md) of the University of Pennsylvania. At Wharton, Milken's fascination with [capital markets](../c/capital_markets.md) began taking shape, particularly his [interest](../i/interest.md) in [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md) dynamics, setting the stage for his future innovations in [finance](../f/finance.md).

## The Junk Bond King

Milken joined Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1969 after completing his MBA. It was here that he revolutionized the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) by expanding the reach of high-[yield](../y/yield.md) bonds, commonly referred to as "junk bonds." Previously, these bonds were considered too risky for most investors, but Milken saw their potential as a means to [finance](../f/finance.md) companies that were overlooked by traditional lending institutions. His innovative approach helped small and mid-sized companies [gain](../g/gain.md) access to [capital](../c/capital.md) that was previously unavailable to them, fostering greater competition and growth within various industries.

Milken's work culminated in the creation of a thriving [market](../m/market.md) for high-[yield](../y/yield.md) securities, which became integral to corporate [financing](../f/financing.md). Drexel Burnham Lambert's [high-yield bond](../h/high-yield_bond.md) division became the highest-grossing unit of the [firm](../f/firm.md), solidifying Milken's reputation as a financial innovator. By the mid-1980s, Milken had become known as the "[Junk Bond](../j/junk_bond.md) King," and his strategies were widely emulated across [Wall Street](../w/wall_street.md).

## Legal Troubles and Conviction

Milken's career took a dramatic turn in the late 1980s when he became the target of an investigation led by US Attorney Rudy Giuliani. The investigation centered on allegations of [insider trading](../i/insider.md) and securities [fraud](../f/fraud.md), linked to Milken's activities in the [high-yield bond](../h/high-yield_bond.md) [market](../m/market.md) and his interactions with other traders and companies.

In 1989, Milken was indicted on 98 counts of [racketeering](../r/racketeering.md) and [fraud](../f/fraud.md). Facing overwhelming legal pressures, he eventually pleaded guilty to six lesser securities and reporting violations. In 1990, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison, a term that was later reduced to two years for good behavior. Alongside the prison sentence, Milken was fined $600 million, permanently barred from the securities [industry](../i/industry.md), and required to perform a substantial amount of community service.

## Philanthropy and Reinvention

After serving his prison sentence, Milken embarked on a journey to reinvent himself. Despite his exile from the securities [industry](../i/industry.md), his [wealth](../w/wealth.md) and financial acumen remained intact, allowing him to focus on [philanthropy](../p/philanthropy.md) and social initiatives. Milken has donated substantial amounts to educational, medical, and public health causes, leveraging his resources to drive impactful change.

### Education Initiatives

Milken's contributions to education have been notable. He co-founded the Milken Family Foundation in 1982, which supports programs aimed at enhancing education in the United States. The foundation's flagship programs, such as the Milken Educator Awards, recognize and reward outstanding teachers who have made significant contributions to student achievement and school improvement. The foundation also invests in research and initiatives that aim to reform and improve educational opportunities for children and adults alike.

### Healthcare and Medical Research

Milken's [interest](../i/interest.md) in healthcare stems from his battle with prostate cancer, diagnosed in the early 1990s. He has been a vocal advocate for cancer research funding and has invested significantly in advancing medical research. One of his notable contributions is the Prostate Cancer Foundation, founded in 1993, which has raised over $800 million to [fund](../f/fund.md) groundbreaking research in the prevention, detection, and treatment of prostate cancer.

In addition to prostate cancer research, Milken has supported various initiatives focused on other medical conditions, including nutrition, public health, and chronic diseases. His [philanthropy](../p/philanthropy.md) has emphasized the need for collaboration between public and private sectors to drive innovations in healthcare, ultimately aiming to extend and improve the quality of human life.

### Milken Institute

Perhaps Milken's most enduring legacy is the establishment of the Milken Institute, a non-partisan, non-[profit](../p/profit.md) think tank focused on economic and public policy research. Founded in 1991, the Milken Institute aims to enhance global prosperity by delivering innovative, [market](../m/market.md)-based solutions to some of the world's most pressing challenges. The Institute conducts rigorous research and convenes leading experts in [finance](../f/finance.md), [economics](../e/economics.md), public health, and education to address issues such as job creation, [capital](../c/capital.md) access, and health disparities.

The Milken Institute hosts a series of high-profile conferences, which bring together leaders from various sectors to discuss and develop actionable strategies for building resilient economies. The Global Conference, the Institute's flagship event, attracts thousands of attendees, including policymakers, financiers, philanthropists, and [business](../b/business.md) executives, fostering collaboration and knowledge [exchange](../e/exchange.md) on a global scale.

### Financial Innovations Labs

One of the distinguishing features of the Milken Institute is its Financial Innovations Labs, which design and implement innovative financial solutions to address complex challenges. These labs convene stakeholders from the public and private sectors, including investors, entrepreneurs, and policymakers, to create actionable frameworks that drive [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) and social progress.

Examples of the Institute's work include efforts to expand access to [capital](../c/capital.md) for small businesses, develop sustainable investment strategies, and create financial instruments for [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) development.

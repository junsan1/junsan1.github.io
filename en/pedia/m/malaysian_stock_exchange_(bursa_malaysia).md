# Malaysian Stock Exchange (Bursa Malaysia)

The **Malaysian Stock Exchange**, officially known as **Bursa Malaysia**, is the main stock exchange in Malaysia. It provides a platform for traders and investors to buy and sell a wide range of securities such as equities, derivatives, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), and Islamic products. As a critical component of Malaysia's financial ecosystem, Bursa Malaysia plays an essential role in the country’s economic development by facilitating capital formation and promoting transparency in financial markets.

## History and Evolution

Bursa Malaysia was established in 1964 as the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE). Over the years, the exchange underwent several transformations. The most significant change came in 2004 when KLSE was demutualized, resulting in its transformation into Bursa Malaysia. This demutualization aimed to enhance the exchange’s competitiveness and attract more foreign investments.

## Structure and Organization

Bursa Malaysia is composed of various market sectors, each serving specific segments of the economy. The main sectors include the Main Market, the ACE Market, and the LEAP Market.

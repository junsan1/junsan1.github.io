# Market Indicators

[Market](../m/market.md) indicators are statistical measures or mathematical calculations commonly used in the realm of [finance](../f/finance.md) and trading to gauge the current state or projected movements of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). These indicators help traders and investors make informed decisions by providing insights into [market](../m/market.md) trends and helping to evaluate the performance of various assets. [Market](../m/market.md) indicators can be categorized mainly into two types: [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicator.md) and fundamental indicators.

## Technical Indicators

[Technical indicators](../t/technical_indicator.md) use historical price and [volume](../v/volume.md) data of securities to predict future price movements. Below are some of the most widely used [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicator.md):

### Moving Averages

Moving averages smooth out price data to create a single flowing line, making it easier to identify the direction of the [trend](../t/trend.md). There are two main types of moving averages:

- **Simple Moving Average (SMA):** Calculated by averaging the closing prices of a [security](../s/security.md) over a specific period.
- **Exponential Moving Average (EMA):** More complex and gives more weight to recent prices.

### Relative Strength Index (RSI)

RSI is a [momentum](../m/momentum.md) [oscillator](../o/oscillator.md) that measures the speed and change of price movements. It ranges from 0 to 100 and typically, a reading above 70 suggests that the [market](../m/market.md) is [overbought](../o/overbought.md), whereas a reading below 30 indicates that it is [oversold](../o/oversold.md).

### Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)

MACD is a [trend](../t/trend.md)-following [momentum](../m/momentum.md) [indicator](../i/indicator.md) that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a [security](../s/security.md)’s price. The MACD line is calculated by subtracting the 26-period EMA from the 12-period EMA. A nine-day EMA of the MACD is called the "signal line," which helps identify buy or sell signals.

### Bollinger Bands

[Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_band.md) consist of a middle band (SMA) and two outer bands (standard deviations away from the SMA). The bands expand and contract based on [volatility](../v/volatility.md). Prices tend to bounce within the bands.

### Stochastic Oscillator

The [stochastic oscillator](../s/stochastic_oscillator.md) compares a particular closing price of a [security](../s/security.md) to a [range](../r/range.md) of its prices over a certain period. It ranges from 0 to 100. Values above 80 are considered [overbought](../o/overbought.md), and values below 20 are considered [oversold](../o/oversold.md).

### Fibonacci Retracement

[Fibonacci retracement](../f/fibonacci_retracement.md) is a method used in [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) to find potential [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels by using horizontal lines at the key Fibonacci levels before the [trend](../t/trend.md) continues in its original direction.

### Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)

VWAP is a trading [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) that gives the average price a [security](../s/security.md) has traded at throughout the day, based on both [volume](../v/volume.md) and price. It helps traders to identify the average price at which a stock is trading over a series of trades.

## Fundamental Indicators

Fundamental indicators, on the other hand, analyze the [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and performance of a company, sector, or [economy](../e/economy.md). Here are some key fundamental indicators:

### Earnings Per Share (EPS)

EPS is a company’s [profit](../p/profit.md) divided by the outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md) of its [common stock](../c/common_stock.md). It serves as an [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of a company's profitability.

### Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio)

The P/E ratio measures a company’s current share price relative to its per-share [earnings](../e/earnings.md). It helps investors gauge the [value](../v/value.md) of a stock.

### Dividend Yield

[Dividend yield](../d/dividend_yield.md) is a financial ratio that shows how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative to its stock price. It's a way of measuring the cash [return](../r/return.md) for an investment in a stock.

### Book Value

[Book value](../b/book_value.md) is the net [asset](../a/asset.md) [value](../v/value.md) of a company calculated as total assets minus intangible assets (patents, [goodwill](../g/goodwill.md)) and liabilities. It's used for assessing a company’s [valuation](../v/valuation.md).

### Return on Equity (ROE)

ROE measures a [corporation](../c/corporation.md)'s profitability by revealing how much [profit](../p/profit.md) a company generates with the [money](../m/money.md) shareholders have invested. It is calculated as Net [Income](../i/income.md) / [Shareholder](../s/shareholder.md)'s [Equity](../e/equity.md).

### Debt-to-Equity Ratio

This ratio indicates the relative proportion of shareholders' [equity](../e/equity.md) and [debt](../d/debt.md) used to [finance](../f/finance.md) a company's assets. A higher ratio means more [risk](../r/risk.md) due to the increased financial [leverage](../l/leverage.md).

### Economic Indicators

[Economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md) give a broader view of economic health, affecting various markets, including [stocks](../s/stock.md), commodities, and forex. Commonly tracked [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md) include:

- **Gross Domestic Product (GDP):** Measures the overall economic output.
- **[Unemployment Rate](../u/unemployment_rate.md):** Percentage of the total labor force that is unemployed but actively seeking employment.
- **[Inflation](../i/inflation.md) Rate:** The rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising.
- **[Interest](../i/interest.md) Rates:** Costs of borrowing [money](../m/money.md) typically set by a country's central [bank](../b/bank.md).

## Application in Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) (or algo-trading) uses computer algorithms to manage trading and investments. [Market](../m/market.md) indicators play a crucial role in the design and [execution](../e/execution.md) of these automated [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

### Quantitative Analysis

[Quantitative analysis](../q/quantitative_analysis.md) involves using mathematical and statistical models derived from [market](../m/market.md) indicators to create [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md). These models can identify trading opportunities and risks based on historical data.

### Backtesting

[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) involves applying [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) to historical [market](../m/market.md) data to evaluate their performance, using [market](../m/market.md) indicators to simulate trades and measure profitability, [risk](../r/risk.md), and other [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md).

### Signal Generation

[Market](../m/market.md) indicators are used in algorithms to generate buy, sell, or [hold](../h/hold.md) signals. For instance, a simple moving average crossover might trigger a buy signal, whereas an RSI dropping below 30 can trigger a buy signal for an [oversold](../o/oversold.md) [asset](../a/asset.md).

### Risk Management

[Risk management](../r/risk_management.md) strategies often incorporate [market](../m/market.md) indicators to determine stop-loss levels, position sizes, and [leverage](../l/leverage.md). Indicators like the [Average True Range](../a/average_true_range_(atr).md) (ATR) are specifically useful for setting stop-loss levels based on [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

### High-Frequency Trading (HFT)

In HFT, [market](../m/market.md) indicators can help algorithms make split-second decisions about [market](../m/market.md) entry and exit points, trying to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on minute price discrepancies. High-speed data and [market](../m/market.md) indicators are essential for HFT firms to maintain a competitive edge.

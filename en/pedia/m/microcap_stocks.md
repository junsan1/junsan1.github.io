## What Are Microcap Stocks?

Microcap stocks, often referred to as micro-cap or microcaps, are publicly traded companies in the stock market with a relatively small market capitalization. Market capitalization, or market cap, represents the total market value of a company's outstanding shares of stock and is calculated by multiplying the current share price by the total number of outstanding shares. Specifically, microcap stocks are typically defined as companies with market capitalizations between $50 million to $300 million.

## Characteristics of Microcap Stocks

Microcap stocks possess unique characteristics that distinguish them from larger, more established companies. These traits include:

This makes it more challenging to buy or sell large quantities of shares without significantly impacting the stock price.
2. **Higher Growth Potential**: Being smaller companies, microcaps have the potential for higher [growth rates](../g/growth_rates_in_trading.md) compared to [large-cap stocks](../l/large_cap_stocks.md).

# Multilevel Marketing

Multilevel [marketing](../m/marketing.md) (MLM)—also known as [network marketing](../n/network_marketing.md), pyramid selling, and referral [marketing](../m/marketing.md)—is a strategy some direct sales companies use to encourage their existing distributors to recruit new distributors by paying the existing distributors a percentage of their recruits' sales. Recruits are known as a distributor's "downline". Distributors also make [money](../m/money.md) through direct sales of products to customers. MLM is often controversial and has been criticized for being similar to illegal pyramid schemes, though it is legally distinct.

## Business Model

### Structure
MLM companies operate by recruiting individuals into the [business](../b/business.md) who then sell products directly to consumers. These recruits, or distributors, are also encouraged to recruit others into the [business](../b/business.md). The structure operates in various levels, hence the name "multilevel [marketing](../m/marketing.md)". Each level a distributor recruits and trains falls under their "downline" and forms a hierarchical structure that resembles a pyramid.

### Revenue Sources
Distributors in a MLM company earn [income](../i/income.md) in two primary ways:
1. Direct Sales: [Income](../i/income.md) is earned by selling products directly to consumers.
2. Downline Commissions: [Income](../i/income.md) is also earned from a percentage of sales made by those they recruit (their downline), and sometimes from the recruits of their recruits (i.e., deeper levels of the downline).

## Compensation Plans
MLM companies use various compensation plans to incentivize distributors. Some common types include:

### Binary Plans
Distributors are allowed to have two downlines, or "legs". [Income](../i/income.md) is earned based on the sales [volume](../v/volume.md) in both legs.

### Unilevel Plans
Distributors can recruit an unlimited number of downline distributors but only one level. [Income](../i/income.md) is based on direct recruits' sales.

### Matrix Plans
Distributors have a fixed number of recruits they can bring in directly. These plans operate on a grid, such as a 3x3 matrix where each distributor can recruit three members directly.

### Hybrid Plans
Combines aspects of two or more compensation plans to [offer](../o/offer.md) more flexibility in how distributors can earn.

## Legal Considerations

### Pyramid Scheme vs. Legitimate MLM
While MLM is legal in many countries, it is often scrutinized due to its similarities with illegal pyramid schemes. The key distinguishing [factor](../f/factor.md) is that in a legitimate MLM, [income](../i/income.md) is primarily derived from selling actual products or services rather than the mere act of recruiting new distributors.

### Regulatory Bodies
Several regulatory bodies monitor and regulate MLM activities:
- **Federal [Trade](../t/trade.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (FTC)**: In the United States, the FTC ensures that MLM companies comply with consumer protection laws.
- **Direct Selling Association (DSA)**: A self-regulatory organization that provides guidelines and standards for ethical [business](../b/business.md) practices in MLM.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages
- **Low Start-Up Costs**: Generally, initial investment is minimal.
- **Flexibility**: Can be operated from [home](../h/home.md) and part-time.
- **Unlimited [Income](../i/income.md) Potential**: Theoretically, no cap on [earnings](../e/earnings.md) due to the recruitment nature.

### Disadvantages
- **High [Attrition](../a/attrition.md) Rate**: Many distributors [fail](../f/fail.md) to make a significant [income](../i/income.md).
- **[Market Saturation](../m/market_saturation.md)**: As more people join, the [market](../m/market.md) for the product might become saturated.
- **Reputation**: MLMs are often scrutinized due to their similarity to pyramid schemes.

## Ethical and Social Considerations

### Transparency
Ethics in MLM emphasizes [transparency](../t/transparency.md) regarding potential [earnings](../e/earnings.md) and the nature of the [business](../b/business.md) model. Many companies have been accused of misleading recruits about the [income](../i/income.md) potential.

### Income Disclosure Statements
Ethical MLM companies often provide [income](../i/income.md) [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) statements, detailing the average [earnings](../e/earnings.md) of their distributors.

### Social Impact
The social impact of MLM can be mixed. While it provides opportunities for some, others may experience financial loss, leading to economic and social challenges.

## Conclusion
Multilevel [Marketing](../m/marketing.md) is a complex [business](../b/business.md) model with potential for both high rewards and significant risks. While it can [offer](../o/offer.md) financial opportunities and flexibility, it is essential for prospective distributors to thoroughly research and understand the intricacies of MLM to make an informed decision. Ethical practices, [transparency](../t/transparency.md), and adherence to legal guidelines are crucial for maintaining the legitimacy and positive reputation of MLM as a [business](../b/business.md) model.

# Mean-Variance Analysis

Mean-variance analysis is a quantitative tool used in finance to make investment decisions based on the tradeoff between risk and return. It is an essential concept in modern portfolio theory (MPT), developed by Harry Markowitz in the 1950s, which has since become a foundational theory in financial economics. This analysis helps investors construct portfolios that optimally balance expected returns against risk.

## Concept Overview

The cornerstone of mean-variance analysis is the idea that investors wish to maximize their returns for a given level of risk or equivalently minimize their risk for a given level of return. The "mean" in mean-variance refers to the expected return of an asset, while "variance" refers to the variability or volatility of returns - a measure of risk.

### Expected Return (Mean)

The expected return of a portfolio is a weighted sum of the expected returns of its individual assets. Mathematically, if a portfolio consists of \(n\) assets, and \(R_i\) is the return on asset \(i\), the expected return \(E(R)\) of the portfolio is given by:

\[ E(R_p) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i E(R_i) \]

Where:
- \(R_p\): Return of the portfolio
- \(w_i\): Weight of the \(i\)-th asset in the portfolio
- \(E(R_i)\): Expected return of the \(i\)-th asset

### Variance and Covariance

Variance measures the dispersion of returns around the mean return. For a single asset, the variance \( \sigma_i^2 \) is represented as:

\[ \sigma_i^2 = E[(R_i - E(R_i))^2] \]

In a portfolio of multiple assets, the risk (variance of the portfolio returns) is determined not only by the variances of individual assets but also by the covariances between returns of the assets. Covariance measures how two assets move in relation to each other. For assets \(i\) and \(j\), the covariance \( \text{Cov}(R_i, R_j) \) is:

\[ \text{Cov}(R_i, R_j) = E[(R_i - E(R_i))(R_j - E(R_j))] \]

### Portfolio Risk (Variance)

The variance of a portfolio, \( \sigma_p^2 \), made up of \(n\) assets is given by:

\[ \sigma_p^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} w_i w_j \text{Cov}(R_i, R_j) \]

If \( i = j \), then \(\text{Cov}(R_i, R_i) = \sigma_i^2 \). This equation shows that the portfolio risk depends on the weights of the assets, their individual variances, and the covariances between each pair of assets.

## The Efficient Frontier

In mean-variance analysis, the efficient frontier represents the set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a defined level of risk or the lowest risk for a specified level of return. Portfolios on the efficient frontier are considered optimal because they provide maximum return for their level of risk.

### Creation of the Efficient Frontier

To construct the efficient frontier:
1. Define a range of target returns.
2. For each target return, calculate the portfolio composition that minimizes risk (variance).
3. Plot the expected returns against the corresponding portfolio variances.

This results in a curve that shows the trade-off between risk and return. Portfolios that lie below the efficient frontier are sub-optimal because they offer lower returns for the same risk or higher risk for the same returns.

## Capital Market Line (CML)

The Capital Market Line (CML) is a line that represents portfolios that optimally combine risk-free assets and the market portfolio. The market portfolio is a theoretically optimal portfolio of all risky assets. The CML sets a benchmark for risk-return tradeoff:

\[ E(R_p) = R_f + \frac{E(R_m) - R_f}{\sigma_m} \sigma_p \]

Where:
- \(R_p\): Expected return of the portfolio
- \(R_f\): Risk-free rate
- \(E(R_m)\): Expected return of the market portfolio
- \(\sigma_m\): Standard deviation of the market portfolio
- \(\sigma_p\): Standard deviation of the portfolio

The CML highlights that an investor's return is based on a reward for taking on incremental risk relative to a risk-free investment.

## Sharpe Ratio

The Sharpe Ratio, named after William F. Sharpe, is a measure used to understand the performance of an investment compared to its risk. It represents the additional return per unit of risk. The Sharpe Ratio is calculated as:

\[ \text{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{E(R_p) - R_f}{\sigma_p} \]

A higher Sharpe Ratio indicates a more favorable risk-adjusted return. It is a critical metric in mean-variance analysis for evaluating the efficiency of an investment portfolio.

## Limitations of Mean-Variance Analysis

While mean-variance analysis is a powerful tool in finance, it has several limitations:

1. **Assumption of Normality**:
   - Returns are assumed to follow a normal distribution. However, in reality, asset returns can exhibit skewness and kurtosis.

2. **Single-Period Model**:
   - The analysis operates under a single-period assumption and does not account for changes over multiple periods.

3. **Parameter Sensitivity**:
   - Mean-variance analysis relies heavily on the accuracy of the expected returns, variances, and covariances. Estimating these parameters can be challenging.

4. **Risk Measurement**:
   - Variance (or standard deviation) is used as the risk measure, which may not capture all dimensions of risk, such as tail risk or extreme events.

## Application in Algorithmic Trading

Mean-variance analysis is fundamental in algorithmic trading, where quantitative models and algorithms are developed to make systematic investment decisions. Traders use mean-variance optimization to construct portfolios that maximize expected returns while keeping risk within acceptable bounds. 

### Steps in Algorithmic Implementation

1. **Data Gathering**:
   - Collect historical price data for relevant assets to estimate expected returns, variances, and covariances.

2. **Return Calculation**:
   - Calculate historical returns and their statistical properties.

3. **Covariance Matrix Estimation**:
   - Estimate the covariance matrix to understand the relationship between asset returns.

4. **Optimization Algorithm**:
   - Implement optimization algorithms (e.g., quadratic programming) to solve for the portfolio weights that minimize risk for a given return or maximize return for a given risk.

5. **Backtesting**:
   - Validate the strategy by backtesting it against historical data to assess its performance.

6. **Execution**:
   - Use algorithmic trading platforms and APIs to execute the optimal portfolios in real-time markets.

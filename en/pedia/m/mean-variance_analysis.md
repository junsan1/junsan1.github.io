# Mean-Variance Analysis

Mean-[variance analysis](../v/variance_analysis.md) is a quantitative tool used in [finance](../f/finance.md) to make investment decisions based on the tradeoff between [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md). It is an essential concept in modern portfolio theory (MPT), developed by [Harry Markowitz](../h/harry_markowitz.md) in the 1950s, which has since become a foundational theory in [financial economics](../f/financial_economics.md). This analysis helps investors construct portfolios that optimally balance expected returns against [risk](../r/risk.md).

## Concept Overview

The cornerstone of mean-[variance analysis](../v/variance_analysis.md) is the idea that investors wish to maximize their returns for a given level of [risk](../r/risk.md) or equivalently minimize their [risk](../r/risk.md) for a given level of [return](../r/return.md). The "mean" in mean-variance refers to the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) of an [asset](../a/asset.md), while "variance" refers to the [variability](../v/variability.md) or [volatility](../v/volatility.md) of returns - a measure of [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Expected Return (Mean)

The [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) of a portfolio is a [weighted](../w/weighted.md) sum of the expected returns of its individual assets. Mathematically, if a portfolio consists of \(n\) assets, and \(R_i\) is the [return](../r/return.md) on [asset](../a/asset.md) \(i\), the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) \(E(R)\) of the portfolio is given by:

\[ E(R_p) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i E(R_i) \]

Where:
- \(R_p\): [Return](../r/return.md) of the portfolio
- \(w_i\): Weight of the \(i\)-th [asset](../a/asset.md) in the portfolio
- \(E(R_i)\): [Expected return](../e/expected_return.md) of the \(i\)-th [asset](../a/asset.md)

### Variance and Covariance

Variance measures the [dispersion](../d/dispersion.md) of returns around the mean [return](../r/return.md). For a single [asset](../a/asset.md), the variance \( \sigma_i^2 \) is represented as:

\[ \sigma_i^2 = E[(R_i - E(R_i))^2] \]

In a portfolio of [multiple](../m/multiple.md) assets, the [risk](../r/risk.md) (variance of the portfolio returns) is determined not only by the variances of individual assets but also by the covariances between returns of the assets. [Covariance](../c/covariance.md) measures how two assets move in relation to each other. For assets \(i\) and \(j\), the [covariance](../c/covariance.md) \( \text{Cov}(R_i, R_j) \) is:

\[ \text{Cov}(R_i, R_j) = E[(R_i - E(R_i))(R_j - E(R_j))] \]

### Portfolio Risk (Variance)

The variance of a portfolio, \( \sigma_p^2 \), made up of \(n\) assets is given by:

\[ \sigma_p^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} w_i w_j \text{Cov}(R_i, R_j) \]

If \( i = j \), then \(\text{Cov}(R_i, R_i) = \sigma_i^2 \). This equation shows that the portfolio [risk](../r/risk.md) depends on the weights of the assets, their individual variances, and the covariances between each pair of assets.

## The Efficient Frontier

In mean-[variance analysis](../v/variance_analysis.md), the [efficient frontier](../e/efficient_frontier.md) represents the set of optimal portfolios that [offer](../o/offer.md) the highest [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) for a defined level of [risk](../r/risk.md) or the lowest [risk](../r/risk.md) for a specified level of [return](../r/return.md). Portfolios on the [efficient frontier](../e/efficient_frontier.md) are considered optimal because they provide maximum [return](../r/return.md) for their level of [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Creation of the Efficient Frontier

To construct the [efficient frontier](../e/efficient_frontier.md):
1. Define a [range](../r/range.md) of target returns.
2. For each target [return](../r/return.md), calculate the portfolio composition that minimizes [risk](../r/risk.md) (variance).
3. Plot the expected returns against the corresponding portfolio variances.

This results in a curve that shows the [trade](../t/trade.md)-off between [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md). Portfolios that lie below the [efficient frontier](../e/efficient_frontier.md) are sub-optimal because they [offer](../o/offer.md) lower returns for the same [risk](../r/risk.md) or higher [risk](../r/risk.md) for the same returns.

## Capital Market Line (CML)

The [Capital](../c/capital.md) [Market](../m/market.md) Line (CML) is a line that represents portfolios that optimally combine [risk](../r/risk.md)-free assets and the [market portfolio](../m/market_portfolio.md). The [market portfolio](../m/market_portfolio.md) is a theoretically optimal portfolio of all risky assets. The CML sets a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for [risk-return tradeoff](../r/risk-return_tradeoff.md):

\[ E(R_p) = R_f + \frac{E(R_m) - R_f}{\sigma_m} \sigma_p \]

Where:
- \(R_p\): [Expected return](../e/expected_return.md) of the portfolio
- \(R_f\): [Risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate
- \(E(R_m)\): [Expected return](../e/expected_return.md) of the [market portfolio](../m/market_portfolio.md)
- \(\sigma_m\): [Standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) of the [market portfolio](../m/market_portfolio.md)
- \(\sigma_p\): [Standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) of the portfolio

The CML highlights that an [investor](../i/investor.md)'s [return](../r/return.md) is based on a reward for taking on incremental [risk](../r/risk.md) relative to a [risk](../r/risk.md)-free investment.

## Sharpe Ratio

The [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md), named after [William F. Sharpe](../w/william_f._sharpe.md), is a measure used to understand the performance of an investment compared to its [risk](../r/risk.md). It represents the additional [return](../r/return.md) per unit of [risk](../r/risk.md). The [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) is calculated as:

\[ \text{[Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md)} = \frac{E(R_p) - R_f}{\sigma_p} \]

A higher [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) indicates a more favorable [risk-adjusted return](../r/risk-adjusted_return.md). It is a critical metric in mean-[variance analysis](../v/variance_analysis.md) for evaluating the [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) of an investment portfolio.

## Limitations of Mean-Variance Analysis

While mean-[variance analysis](../v/variance_analysis.md) is a powerful tool in [finance](../f/finance.md), it has several limitations:

1. **Assumption of Normality**:
   - Returns are assumed to follow a [normal distribution](../n/normal_distribution_in_trading.md). However, in reality, [asset](../a/asset.md) returns can exhibit [skewness and kurtosis](../s/skewness_and_kurtosis.md).

2. **Single-Period Model**:
   - The analysis operates under a single-period assumption and does not account for changes over [multiple](../m/multiple.md) periods.

3. **Parameter Sensitivity**:
   - Mean-[variance analysis](../v/variance_analysis.md) relies heavily on the accuracy of the expected returns, variances, and covariances. Estimating these parameters can be challenging.

4. **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Measurement**:
   - Variance (or [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md)) is used as the [risk](../r/risk.md) measure, which may not capture all dimensions of [risk](../r/risk.md), such as [tail risk](../t/tail_risk.md) or extreme events.

## Application in Algorithmic Trading

Mean-[variance analysis](../v/variance_analysis.md) is fundamental in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), where [quantitative models](../q/quantitative_models.md) and algorithms are developed to make systematic investment decisions. Traders use [mean-variance optimization](../m/mean-variance_optimization.md) to construct portfolios that maximize expected returns while keeping [risk](../r/risk.md) within acceptable bounds. 

### Steps in Algorithmic Implementation

1. **Data Gathering**:
   - Collect historical price data for relevant assets to estimate expected returns, variances, and covariances.

2. **[Return](../r/return.md) Calculation**:
   - Calculate [historical returns](../h/historical_returns.md) and their statistical properties.

3. **[Covariance](../c/covariance.md) Matrix Estimation**:
   - Estimate the [covariance](../c/covariance.md) matrix to understand the relationship between [asset](../a/asset.md) returns.

4. **[Optimization](../o/optimization.md) Algorithm**:
   - Implement [optimization](../o/optimization.md) algorithms (e.g., quadratic programming) to solve for the portfolio weights that minimize [risk](../r/risk.md) for a given [return](../r/return.md) or maximize [return](../r/return.md) for a given [risk](../r/risk.md).

5. **[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md)**:
   - Validate the strategy by [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) it against historical data to assess its performance.

6. **[Execution](../e/execution.md)**:
   - Use [algorithmic trading platforms](../a/algorithmic_trading_platforms.md) and APIs to execute the optimal portfolios in real-time markets.

# Managed Account

A managed account, also known as a managed investment account (MIA) or managed [financial account](../f/financial_account.md) (MFA), is a type of investment account that is owned by an individual [investor](../i/investor.md) but overseen by a professional [money manager](../m/money_manager.md), hired by the client, who makes investment decisions on behalf of the client. This arrangement is often favored by affluent investors who wish to employ a level of personalized [investment management](../i/investment_management.md) that offers more tailored and bespoke solutions compared to mutual funds or [exchange](../e/exchange.md)-traded funds (ETFs). Managed accounts can encompass a variety of [asset](../a/asset.md) classes, including equities, [fixed income](../f/fixed_income.md), commodities, and more sophisticated financial products.

## Types of Managed Accounts

### Separately Managed Accounts (SMAs)

Separately Managed Accounts (SMAs) are individually managed investment accounts created for a single [investor](../i/investor.md). Unlike mutual funds, where the [investor](../i/investor.md) owns [shares](../s/shares.md) in a pooled [fund](../f/fund.md), an SMA provides direct ownership of the securities within the account. This allows for greater customization and potential tax advantages.

### Unified Managed Accounts (UMAs)

Unified Managed Accounts (UMAs) are all-in-one investment solutions that consolidate [multiple](../m/multiple.md) types of investment assets within a single account. A UMA might include mutual funds, ETFs, individual securities, and alternative investments. This method simplifies reporting and management and can [offer](../o/offer.md) enhanced [diversification](../d/diversification.md).

### Wrap Accounts

Wrap accounts charge a single, all-inclusive [fee](../f/fee.md) that covers administrative fees, [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md), and advisory fees. This makes it easier for investors to understand the total cost of their investment, although wrap fees can be relatively high.

### Hedge Funds and Private Equity

Although not always classified as traditional managed accounts, [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds and [private equity](../p/private_equity.md) investments are managed investment vehicles that [offer](../o/offer.md) sophisticated strategies aimed at outperforming traditional markets. These funds are often available through managed account structures.

## Key Features of Managed Accounts

### Customization

One of the most distinguishing features of managed accounts is the level of customization they [offer](../o/offer.md). Unlike mutual funds or ETFs, managed accounts allow the [investor](../i/investor.md) to tailor the portfolio to meet their specific needs, [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md), and investment objectives. For example, an [investor](../i/investor.md) could impose socially responsible [investing](../i/investing.md) guidelines or prioritize certain [asset](../a/asset.md) classes.

### Active Management

Managed accounts are actively managed, meaning that the [money manager](../m/money_manager.md) frequently buys and sells securities to achieve the client’s investment objectives. This stands in contrast to passively managed investments, like [index](../i/index.md) funds, which aim to replicate a [market index](../m/market_index.md).

### Transparency

With managed accounts, investors have complete [transparency](../t/transparency.md) regarding their [holdings](../h/holdings.md), transactions, and fees. This is beneficial for investors who seek a detailed understanding of their investments and associated costs.

### Tax Efficiency

Managed accounts can be structured to optimize tax [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) through strategies such as tax-loss harvesting. Direct ownership of securities allows for individualized tax management, which can be more advantageous compared to the shared ownership of mutual funds.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Managed Accounts

### Advantages

- **Personalization**: The level of customization available allows for portfolios tailored to individual investment goals, [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md), and preferences.
- **[Transparency](../t/transparency.md)**: Investors receive detailed statements showing all transactions, [holdings](../h/holdings.md), and fees, providing a clear picture of their investments.
- **Tax [Efficiency](../e/efficiency.md)**: Through techniques such as tax-loss harvesting, managed accounts can help reduce the tax burden.
- **Direct Ownership**: Investors own the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) securities, enabling personalized tax strategies and avoidance of [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md) [capital](../c/capital.md) gains distributions.
- **Professional Management**: Access to professional management can lead to potentially higher returns and lower risks.

### Disadvantages

- **Cost**: Managed accounts often come with higher fees due to the personalized service and [active management](../a/active_management.md).
- **Minimum Investment**: Many managed accounts require a high minimum investment, making them less accessible to smaller investors.
- **Complexity**: The complexity of managing a portfolio customized to an individual [investor](../i/investor.md)'s requirements might be overwhelming for some investors.
- **Performance**: There's always [risk](../r/risk.md) involved, and professional management does not guarantee better performance. The success of a managed account depends heavily on the skill of the manager.

## Fees and Cost Structure

Managed accounts typically have a [fee](../f/fee.md) structure that includes the following:

- **[Asset](../a/asset.md)-Based Fees**: The most common [fee](../f/fee.md) is a percentage of assets under management (AUM), which generally ranges from 0.5% to 2% annually.
- **Performance Fees**: Some managers charge performance fees, which are a percentage of the profits generated above a certain [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md).
- **Administrative Fees**: These fees cover the operational costs of managing the account.
- **[Transaction Costs](../t/transaction_costs.md)**: Investors may also incur [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md) for buying and selling securities within the account.

## How to Choose a Managed Account

### Define Your Needs and Goals

Before choosing a managed account, the [investor](../i/investor.md) should have a clear understanding of their financial goals, [time horizon](../t/time_horizon.md), [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md), and investment preferences. This [will](../w/will.md) guide the selection process.

### Research and Due Diligence

It's essential to perform thorough research and [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md). This can include:

- **Manager's Track Record**: Review the historical performance of the manager versus benchmarks.
- **Fees and Expenses**: Verify the total cost and ensure it aligns with the expected level of service and performance.
- **Investment Philosophy and Strategy**: Ensure the manager’s investment style matches the [investor](../i/investor.md)’s objectives.
- **Regulatory Compliance and [Transparency](../t/transparency.md)**: Ensure the manager adheres to [industry](../i/industry.md) regulations and provides transparent reporting.

### Interview Potential Managers

Interviewing potential managers can [offer](../o/offer.md) insights into their approach, communication style, and ability to manage the account in line with the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s objectives.

### Start with a Trial Period

Some investors might benefit from starting with a smaller investment or trial period to evaluate the manager's performance and approach before committing more substantial assets.

## Trends and Future of Managed Accounts

### Technological Integration

Technological advancements, including the use of algorithms and AI, are revolutionizing managed accounts by automating portfolio adjustments and enhancing decision-making processes. These innovations can provide real-time [data analytics](../d/data_analytics.md), which helps managers make more informed investment decisions.

### Robo-Advisors

Robo-advisors are automated platforms [offering](../o/offering.md) algorithm-driven [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md) services with minimal human intervention. They typically provide lower-cost [investment management](../i/investment_management.md) [options](../o/options.md) and can be a stepping stone for investors who are looking for managed solutions but at a lower cost.

### ESG Investing

The rise of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria is influencing how managed accounts are structured. Investors increasingly [demand](../d/demand.md) that their portfolios reflect their values, leading to a surge in ESG-based managed accounts.

### Increased Personalization

As consumer [demand](../d/demand.md) for personalized financial services grows, so does the need for managed accounts that [offer](../o/offer.md) even greater levels of customization. Advanced [data analytics](../d/data_analytics.md) and [customer](../c/customer.md) profiling allow for highly personalized investment strategies.

### Regulatory Changes

Regulatory changes are continually shaping the managed accounts [industry](../i/industry.md). Increased scrutiny and the introduction of new compliance requirements ensure that managed accounts operate transparently and in the best [interest](../i/interest.md) of the clients.

### Hybrid Models

Hybrid models that combine traditional human advisory services with robo-advisory platforms are gaining popularity. These models aim to bring the best of both worlds: the personalized touch of human advisors and the [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and cost-effectiveness of automated platforms.

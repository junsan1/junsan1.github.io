# Market-Adjusted Return

[Market](../m/market.md)-adjusted [return](../r/return.md) is a crucial concept in the realm of [finance](../f/finance.md), specifically in [portfolio management](../p/portfolio_management.md) and performance measurement. This metric serves as a means to evaluate the performance of an investment [asset](../a/asset.md) by comparing it relative to a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md) that represents the overall [market](../m/market.md). Essentially, [market](../m/market.md)-adjusted [return](../r/return.md) helps investors understand how well or poorly an investment has performed after [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for the general movements of the [market](../m/market.md). This is particularly vital when it comes to isolating the performance attributed to the investment's unique characteristics and the competence of the [portfolio manager](../p/portfolio_manager.md), rather than the movements of the [market](../m/market.md) as a whole.

### Definition and Importance

[Market](../m/market.md)-adjusted [return](../r/return.md) is calculated by taking the raw [return](../r/return.md) of the investment minus the [return](../r/return.md) of a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md) over the same period. This provides a more accurate measure of an [asset](../a/asset.md)'s performance by controlling for the [market](../m/market.md) effects. For instance, if the S&P 500 [index](../i/index_instrument.md) returns 10% over a year, and a specific stock returns 15%, the [market](../m/market.md)-adjusted [return](../r/return.md) for that stock would be 5%. This signifies that 5% of the stock's [return](../r/return.md) is attributable to factors other than the general [market](../m/market.md) performance.

The importance of [market](../m/market.md)-adjusted [return](../r/return.md) cannot be overstated. It is a fundamental tool for both individual and institutional investors in understanding the skill and decision-making quality of a [portfolio manager](../p/portfolio_manager.md). Moreover, it helps in attributing the correct factors affecting the performance of an investment.

### Calculation

To compute the [market](../m/market.md)-adjusted [return](../r/return.md), follow these steps:

1. **Determine the Period of Evaluation:** Identify the specific period for which you want to calculate the [return](../r/return.md). This could be a week, month, quarter, or year.
  
2. **Identify the Investment's [Return](../r/return.md):** Calculate the [total return](../t/total_return.md) of the investment over the chosen period. This [total return](../t/total_return.md) includes both [capital](../c/capital.md) gains and dividends or [interest](../i/interest.md) earned.
  
3. **Identify the [Benchmark](../b/benchmark.md)'s [Return](../r/return.md):** Determine the [return](../r/return.md) of the chosen [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md) over the same period. Commonly used benchmarks include the S&P 500, [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md) Composite, or Russell 2000.

4. **Calculate the [Market](../m/market.md)-Adjusted [Return](../r/return.md):** Subtract the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md)'s [return](../r/return.md) from the investment’s [return](../r/return.md):
   \[
   \text{[Market](../m/market.md)-Adjusted [Return](../r/return.md)} = \text{Investment [Return](../r/return.md)} - \text{[Benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [Return](../r/return.md)}
   \]

### Practical Example

To illustrate, consider an [investor](../i/investor.md) examining the performance of a tech stock, XYZ Corp, compared to the [NASDAQ Composite Index](../n/nasdaq_composite_index.md).

- **Investment Period:** One year
- **XYZ Corp [Return](../r/return.md):** 25%
- **[NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md) Composite [Return](../r/return.md):** 20%

Using the formula, the [market](../m/market.md)-adjusted [return](../r/return.md) is:

\[
\text{[Market](../m/market.md)-Adjusted [Return](../r/return.md)} = 25\% - 20\% = 5\%
\]

This indicates that XYZ Corp outperformed the [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md) Composite by 5% over the one-year period.

### Applications in Algoritmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) involves the use of automated systems and algorithms to execute trades based on pre-defined criteria. [Market](../m/market.md)-adjusted [return](../r/return.md) is particularly useful in this context for several reasons:

1. **[Performance Benchmarking](../p/performance_benchmarking.md):** Algorithms can be designed to seek investments that provide [market](../m/market.md)-adjusted returns exceeding a certain threshold. Using [market](../m/market.md)-adjusted returns ensures the algorithm focuses on truly high-performing assets.
   
2. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md):** By evaluating [market](../m/market.md)-adjusted returns, algorithms can identify whether superior returns are due to skill in selecting investments or merely a rising [market](../m/market.md), thus aiding in [risk](../r/risk.md) assessment.
   
3. **Strategy [Optimization](../o/optimization.md):** Continuous feedback from [market](../m/market.md)-adjusted [return](../r/return.md) calculations can improve the [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) by adjusting parameters to focus on strategies with historical success in generating [alpha](../a/alpha.md).

### Companies Utilizing Market-Adjusted Returns

Many investment firms and [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds integrate [market](../m/market.md)-adjusted [return](../r/return.md) metrics into their performance evaluation frameworks. Some of these firms include:

- **Bridgewater Associates:** As one of the largest [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds, Bridgewater uses complex algorithms that incorporate [market](../m/market.md)-adjusted returns to optimize [portfolio performance](../p/portfolio_performance.md).

### Market-Adjusted Return vs. Other Metrics

It is important to distinguish [market](../m/market.md)-adjusted [return](../r/return.md) from other popular financial metrics:

- **[Alpha](../a/alpha.md):** While [market](../m/market.md)-adjusted [return](../r/return.md) provides a raw measure of outperformance, [alpha](../a/alpha.md) goes a step further by adjusting for [risk](../r/risk.md). Essentially, [market](../m/market.md)-adjusted [return](../r/return.md) is one component of [alpha](../a/alpha.md).
  
- **[Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md):** This metric assesses the [risk-adjusted return](../r/risk-adjusted_return.md) of an investment, considering both the [return](../r/return.md) relative to a [risk-free asset](../r/risk-free_asset.md) and the investment’s [volatility](../v/volatility.md). The [market](../m/market.md)-adjusted [return](../r/return.md) does not account for [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rates or the investment’s [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md).
  
- **[Beta](../b/beta.md):** This measures an investment’s sensitivity to [market](../m/market.md) movements. High-[beta](../b/beta.md) investments are more volatile relative to the [market](../m/market.md). [Market](../m/market.md)-adjusted [return](../r/return.md), on the other hand, focuses on the excess returns, irrespective of [volatility](../v/volatility.md) metrics.

### Limitations

While [market](../m/market.md)-adjusted [return](../r/return.md) is a valuable tool, it comes with limitations:

- **[Benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) Selection:** The choice of [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) can significantly influence the [market](../m/market.md)-adjusted [return](../r/return.md). Inappropriate [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) selection may distort performance evaluation.
  
- **Time Frame:** [Market](../m/market.md) conditions fluctuate, and performance over short periods may not be indicative of long-term potential.
  
- **External Factors:** Unique events affecting specific securities but not the broader [market](../m/market.md) may skew [market](../m/market.md)-adjusted returns.

### Conclusion

[Market](../m/market.md)-adjusted [return](../r/return.md) serves as a fundamental metric for understanding and evaluating investment performance. By providing insight into how much of an [asset](../a/asset.md)'s [return](../r/return.md) is due to the [market](../m/market.md) versus the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md), it allows for a more nuanced view of investment success. For algorithmic traders and financial analysts, incorporating [market](../m/market.md)-adjusted [return](../r/return.md) into their strategies and evaluations can lead to more informed and effective decision-making. The [utility](../u/utility.md) of this metric, combined with other performance measures, ensures a comprehensive and balanced approach to investment evaluation.

# Money Market Fund

A **[Money Market](../m/money_market.md) [Fund](../f/fund.md)** (MMF) is a type of [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md) that invests in [short-term debt](../s/short-term_debt.md) securities and monetary instruments with high [credit](../c/credit.md) quality. The primary objective of MMFs is to [offer](../o/offer.md) high [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) with a very low level of [risk](../r/risk.md). These funds are structured to provide investors with a safe place to invest easily accessible, cash-equivalent assets. MMFs can be invested in by individual retail investors, institutional investors, and even organizations looking to manage their short-term cash needs.

## 1. Characteristics of Money Market Funds

### 1.1 High Liquidity
[Money market](../m/money_market.md) funds are highly [liquid](../l/liquid.md) investments, meaning they can be quickly converted into cash without significant loss of [value](../v/value.md). Investors in MMFs can typically withdraw their funds at any time, and the transactions are usually settled within one [business](../b/business.md) day.

### 1.2 Low Risk
These funds invest in high-quality, [short-term debt](../s/short-term_debt.md) instruments. The [principal](../p/principal.md) objective is [capital preservation](../c/capital_preservation.md), which translates into minimal [risk](../r/risk.md). The assets often include [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) bills, [commercial paper](../c/commercial_paper.md), CDs (Certificates of [Deposit](../d/deposit.md)), and highly-rated corporate [debt](../d/debt.md).

### 1.3 Stable Net Asset Value (NAV)
Most [money market](../m/money_market.md) funds aim to maintain a constant Net [Asset](../a/asset.md) [Value](../v/value.md) (NAV) of $1 per share. This is designed to simplify transactions and calculations for investors. However, it's vital to understand that this $1 NAV is not guaranteed and can fluctuate based on [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) values, though such occurrences are rare.

### 1.4 Interest Rate Sensitivity
While MMFs are low-[risk](../r/risk.md), they are susceptible to [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) changes. When [interest](../i/interest.md) rates rise, the [yield](../y/yield.md) from MMFs generally increases, and vice versa. Nevertheless, the short-term nature of the [holdings](../h/holdings.md) means that the [interest rate sensitivity](../i/interest_rate_sensitivity.md) is relatively low.

## 2. Types of Money Market Funds

### 2.1 Prime Money Market Funds
Prime MMFs invest in a variety of high-quality, short-term securities issued by both corporations and government entities. These funds might include [commercial paper](../c/commercial_paper.md), certificates of [deposit](../d/deposit.md), and repurchase agreements. Due to a higher [yield](../y/yield.md) potential, they can carry marginally more [risk](../r/risk.md) compared to other MMF types.

### 2.2 Government Money Market Funds
These funds invest solely in government securities such as [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) bills and repurchase agreements backed by these securities. They are considered the safest type of [money market](../m/money_market.md) funds due to the government backing of the instruments they [hold](../h/hold.md).

### 2.3 Municipal Money Market Funds
Municipal MMFs invest in [short-term debt](../s/short-term_debt.md) securities issued by state and local governments. The [income](../i/income.md) generated from these funds is often exempt from federal, state, or local [taxes](../t/taxes.md), making them attractive to investors in higher [tax brackets](../t/tax_brackets.md).

### 2.4 Taxable vs. Tax-Exempt Funds
MMFs can also be classified based on their tax status. Taxable [money market](../m/money_market.md) funds generate [interest](../i/interest.md) [income](../i/income.md) that is subject to [federal income](../f/federal_income.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md). On the other hand, tax-exempt [money market](../m/money_market.md) funds invest in municipal securities that [offer](../o/offer.md) [income](../i/income.md) exempt from federal [taxes](../t/taxes.md), and possibly state and local [taxes](../t/taxes.md).

## 3. Regulation and Oversight

[Money market](../m/money_market.md) funds are subject to stringent regulations to maintain their stability and protect investors. In the United States, the primary regulatory body overseeing these funds is the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC).

### 3.1 SEC Rule 2a-7
Rule 2a-7 under the [Investment Company Act of 1940](../i/investment_company_act_of_1940.md) dictates the quality, [maturity](../m/maturity.md), and diversity of the securities in which MMFs can invest. This rule mandates the following:
- **[Credit](../c/credit.md) Quality:** Limitations on investments in securities with lower [credit](../c/credit.md) ratings.
- **[Maturity](../m/maturity.md):** Short-term [maturity](../m/maturity.md) requirements to mitigate [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md).
- **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md):** Restrictions to minimize the impact of any single [issuer](../i/issuer.md) defaulting.
- **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md):** Daily and weekly [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) requirements to ensure [fund](../f/fund.md) stability.

### 3.2 Stress Testing
MMFs are required to periodically perform stress tests to evaluate their ability to maintain [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) during [market](../m/market.md) stress scenarios. These stress tests help [fund](../f/fund.md) managers identify vulnerabilities and implement corrective measures.

### 3.3 Transparency and Disclosure
Funds must provide detailed disclosures about their investments, including portfolio [holdings](../h/holdings.md), NAV, and performance. This [transparency](../t/transparency.md) is critical for investors to make informed decisions.

## 4. Use Cases and Advantages

### 4.1 Emergency Funds
[Money market](../m/money_market.md) funds are ideal for holding emergency funds due to their [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and low-[risk](../r/risk.md) nature. Investors can access their [money](../m/money.md) quickly without fearing significant losses.

### 4.2 Cash Management for Corporations
Corporations often use MMFs to manage their short-term cash reserves. The ability to earn [interest](../i/interest.md) while maintaining [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) is crucial for businesses that require quick access to funds for operational needs.

### 4.3 Diversification and Income
MMFs provide investors with a way to diversify their investment portfolios while earning a modest [income](../i/income.md). They can serve as a conservative component in a [balanced investment strategy](../b/balanced_investment_strategy.md).

### 4.4 Short-Term Investment Goals
Investors with short-term financial goals, such as saving for a major purchase or upcoming expenses, may find MMFs attractive. The stability and ease of access align well with short-term planning.

## 5. Risks and Considerations

### 5.1 Credit Risk
While MMFs invest in high-quality securities, there is still a minimal [risk](../r/risk.md) that an [issuer](../i/issuer.md) might [default](../d/default.md). Government MMFs typically carry the least [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md), while prime MMFs have a slightly higher [risk](../r/risk.md) profile.

### 5.2 Interest Rate Risk
Changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates affect the [yield](../y/yield.md) of [money market](../m/money_market.md) funds. An increase in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates can enhance yields, but a decrease might lower them. However, due to the short-term nature of the investments, this [risk](../r/risk.md) is relatively low.

### 5.3 Inflation Risk
MMFs generally [offer](../o/offer.md) modest returns that might not outpace [inflation](../i/inflation.md). Over time, [inflation](../i/inflation.md) can erode the [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) of the invested [principal](../p/principal.md).

### 5.4 Sponsor Support Risk
In times of [market](../m/market.md) stress, [fund](../f/fund.md) sponsors (the companies that operate the funds) might provide support to maintain the $1 NAV. However, there is no guarantee that sponsors [will](../w/will.md) always provide such support.

### 5.5 Market Risk
During extreme [market](../m/market.md) conditions, [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) might be impacted, affecting the ability to quickly convert MMF [shares](../s/shares.md) into cash without loss.

# Managed Futures

Managed futures is an investment strategy that involves taking both long and short positions in [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md), along with other derivative products. This strategy is executed within a managed account or pooled fund, operated by professional money managers known as [commodity trading advisors](../c/commodity_trading_advisors_(ctas).md) (CTAs) or commodity pool operators (CPOs). These professionals utilize a variety of strategies, including trend-following, [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), and [systematic trading](../s/systematic_trading.md), leveraging their expertise to potentially profit from movements in the prices of commodities, financial instruments, and other assets.

## Historical Context
The concept of managed futures dates back to the 1970s when the trading of [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) was primarily centered around agricultural commodities. Over the decades, the market has expanded to include financial futures, such as stock [index futures](../i/index_futures.md), [interest rate futures](../i/interest_rate_futures.md), and foreign exchange contracts. This diversification has facilitated the evolution of managed futures as a robust investment strategy capable of providing [portfolio diversification](../p/portfolio_diversification.md) and potential returns uncorrelated with traditional asset classes like stocks and bonds.

## Key Players in Managed Futures
- **Institutional Investors**: Pension funds, endowments, and foundations have increasingly incorporated managed futures into their investment portfolios, seeking to enhance diversification and reduce overall portfolio volatility.
- **[Commodity Trading Advisors](../c/commodity_trading_advisors_(ctas).md) (CTAs)**: Registered with the [Commodity Futures](../c/commodity_futures.md) Trading Commission (CFTC) and members of the National Futures Association (NFA), CTAs are the primary managers of managed futures accounts. They employ various [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), often utilizing algorithmic models and [quantitative analysis](../q/quantitative_analysis.md) to make informed trading decisions.
- **Commodity Pool Operators (CPOs)**: These entities pool funds from multiple investors to trade in futures and commodities markets, providing individual investors access to managed futures strategies that they might not have achieved on their own.

## Trading Strategies
### Trend Following
Trend-following is one of the most popular and widely used strategies in managed futures. It relies on the premise that markets often move in trends, which can be exploited by taking positions in the direction of the prevailing market movement. Trend-following strategies typically involve:
- **Moving Averages**: Utilizing [moving average crossovers](../m/moving_average_crossovers.md) to identify trends.
- **[Momentum Indicators](../m/momentum_indicators.md)**: Tools like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) to spot potential trade opportunities.

### Arbitrage
[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategies in managed futures aim to exploit price discrepancies between related instruments or markets. These opportunities arise from inefficiencies in the markets and can involve:
- **Cash and Carry [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**: Taking advantage of the difference between the spot price of an asset and its futures price.
- **Inter-Commodity Spread [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**: Trading price differences between related but not identical commodities, such as Brent crude oil and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil.

### Systematic Trading
[Systematic trading](../s/systematic_trading.md) involves the use of [quantitative models](../q/quantitative_models.md) and algorithms to identify and exploit trading opportunities. These models are based on statistical analysis, machine learning, and historical data, allowing for:
- **High-Frequency Trading (HFT)**: Strategies that execute a large number of trades at very high speeds, capitalizing on small price movements.
- **[Algorithmic Trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md)**: [Automated trading systems](../a/automated_trading_systems.md) that follow predefined criteria to execute trades, reducing human error and emotional decision-making.

## Risk Management
Effective [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) is crucial in managed futures due to the leverage involved in trading [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md). Techniques used to mitigate risk include:
- **[Position Sizing](../p/position_sizing.md)**: Determining the appropriate amount of capital to risk on a single trade.
- **[Stop-Loss Orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md)**: Automatically closing a position when it reaches a predefined loss threshold.
- **Diversification**: Spreading investments across various markets and instruments to reduce exposure to any single asset.

## Performance and Benefits
Managed futures have historically shown the potential to deliver strong performance, particularly during periods of market stress when traditional asset classes may underperform. The benefits of incorporating managed futures into an investment portfolio include:
- **Diversification**: Reducing portfolio risk through exposure to different markets and asset classes.
- **Non-Correlation**: Providing returns that are not correlated with traditional investments, thereby enhancing the overall risk-return profile.
- **Inflation Hedge**: Offering protection against inflation, as many [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) are linked to physical commodities whose prices tend to rise with inflation.

## Notable Managed Futures Firms
Several firms specialize in managed futures, employing experienced CTAs and sophisticated [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). Some of the leading firms in this space include:
- **AQR Capital Management** (https://www.aqr.com): A quantitative investment management firm known for its systematic approaches to managed futures and other investment strategies.

## Regulatory Environment
Managed futures are subject to regulatory oversight to ensure transparency, fairness, and investor protection. The primary regulatory bodies include:
- **[Commodity Futures](../c/commodity_futures.md) Trading Commission (CFTC)**: The U.S. federal agency responsible for regulating the futures and options markets.
- **National Futures Association (NFA)**: A self-regulatory organization overseeing the activities of CTAs, CPOs, and other market participants.

## Conclusion
Managed futures offer a compelling investment strategy with the potential for [portfolio diversification](../p/portfolio_diversification.md), non-correlated returns, and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) benefits. By leveraging the expertise of professional money managers and sophisticated [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), investors can gain exposure to a wide range of markets and asset classes, potentially enhancing their overall investment performance.

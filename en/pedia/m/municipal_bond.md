# Municipal Bond

A municipal [bond](../b/bond.md), often simply referred to as a muni [bond](../b/bond.md), is a [debt security](../d/debt_security.md) issued by a local government, city, county, or other governmental entity to [finance](../f/finance.md) public projects. These can include [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md), schools, hospitals, and other community services. [Municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md) are essential tools for [financing](../f/financing.md) essential public projects and play a crucial role in the broader financial [market](../m/market.md).

## Types of Municipal Bonds

### General Obligation Bonds (GOs)
General obligation bonds are issued by governments and are backed by the full faith and [credit](../c/credit.md) of the issuing body. This means the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) commits to using its full taxing power to repay the [bond](../b/bond.md). These types of bonds are generally considered low-[risk](../r/risk.md) because they have the municipality's entire [taxation](../t/taxation.md) power to draw upon for [repayment](../r/repayment.md).

### Revenue Bonds
[Revenue](../r/revenue.md) bonds are supported by the [income](../i/income.md) generated from a specific project or source. For instance, a toll road, hospital, [utility](../u/utility.md), or airport might [issue](../i/issue.md) a [revenue bond](../r/revenue_bond.md) to [fund](../f/fund.md) a project that [will](../w/will.md) generate future [revenue](../r/revenue.md) to repay the [bond](../b/bond.md). [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) bonds are considered riskier than general obligation bonds because they depend on the [revenue](../r/revenue.md) from specific projects.

### Assessment Bonds
Assessment bonds, or special assessment bonds, are supported by assessments on the property that benefits from the improvements funded by the [bond](../b/bond.md). These often [fund](../f/fund.md) local improvement projects such as street paving or sewer systems and are repaid through additional property [taxes](../t/taxes.md) levied on properties that benefit from the project.

### Certificates of Participation (COPs)
Certificates of participation are a type of lease-[financing](../f/financing.md) agreement where investors buy [shares](../s/shares.md) in the lease revenues of a program rather than the [bond](../b/bond.md) being a direct obligation of the government. COPs are a way for municipalities to [finance](../f/finance.md) projects without issuing traditional [debt](../d/debt.md).

### Taxable Municipal Bonds
While most [municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md) are tax-exempt, some are taxable. Taxable [municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md) are issued for projects that don't qualify for federal tax [exemption](../e/exemption.md), such as pension funding or sports facilities. These are often used for applications that benefit private enterprises.

## Tax Advantages

### Federal Tax Exemption
One of the primary benefits of most [municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md) is that the [interest](../i/interest.md) paid to investors is exempt from [federal income](../f/federal_income.md) tax, making them highly attractive to investors in higher [tax brackets](../t/tax_brackets.md).

### State and Local Tax Exemption
Depending on the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s state of residence and the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s issuing state, the [interest](../i/interest.md) could also be exempt from state and local [taxes](../t/taxes.md). If you live in the state where the [bond](../b/bond.md) is issued, the [interest](../i/interest.md) might be triple-tax-exempt, meaning no federal, state, or local [taxes](../t/taxes.md) are levied on the [bond](../b/bond.md) [earnings](../e/earnings.md).

## Risk Factors

### Credit Risk
The [risk](../r/risk.md) that the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) [will](../w/will.md) [default](../d/default.md) on its [bond](../b/bond.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md). [Rating](../r/rating.md) agencies like Moody's, S&P, and Fitch provide [credit](../c/credit.md) ratings for [municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md), which investors use to gauge [risk](../r/risk.md). 

### Interest Rate Risk
[Interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md) refers to the possibility that changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates [will](../w/will.md) affect [bond](../b/bond.md) prices. When [interest](../i/interest.md) rates rise, [bond](../b/bond.md) prices typically fall, and vice versa. Long-term bonds are generally more susceptible to [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md).

### Liquidity Risk
[Municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md) are generally less [liquid](../l/liquid.md) than Treasury bonds because they are not traded as frequently. This can be a concern for investors who might need to sell their bonds before [maturity](../m/maturity.md).

## Market and Trading

### Primary Market
In the [primary market](../p/primary_market.md), new issues of [municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md) are sold to investors, typically through a public [offering](../o/offering.md) or [private placement](../p/private_placement.md). [Investment banks](../i/investment_bank_(ib).md) often underwrite these bonds.

### Secondary Market
The [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md) is where investors buy and sell previously issued [municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md). This [market](../m/market.md) is less active compared to corporate bonds or [stocks](../s/stock.md), which can impact [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).

## Financial Instruments and Technology

### Municipal Bond Funds
Municipal [bond](../b/bond.md) funds pool funds from many investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of [municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md). They provide [diversification](../d/diversification.md) and professional management.

### Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)
Municipal [bond](../b/bond.md) ETFs are a type of [investment fund](../i/investment_fund.md) traded on stock exchanges, much like [stocks](../s/stock.md). They aim to track the performance of an [index](../i/index.md) composed of [municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md).

### Electronic Trading Platforms
Electronic trading platforms allow for the more accessible trading of [municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md). These platforms increase [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and provide real-time pricing. Examples include:

- **Tradeweb** (https://www.tradeweb.com/)
- **[MarketAxess](../m/marketaxess.md)** (https://www.[marketaxess](../m/marketaxess.md).com/)

## Key Issuers and Participants

### State and Local Governments
These entities are the primary issuers of [municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md). They use the proceeds to [fund](../f/fund.md) various public projects and services.

### Financial Advisors and Underwriters
Financial advisors guide issuers on [bond](../b/bond.md) structure and [market](../m/market.md) conditions, while underwriters purchase securities from issuers and sell them to investors. 

### Bond Rating Agencies
Agencies such as Moody's, Standard & Poor's, and Fitch assess and provide ratings on the [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) of [municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md). Their ratings influence [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and [investor](../i/investor.md) confidence.

### Investors
These include individual investors, institutional investors, mutual funds, and pension funds. Each [investor](../i/investor.md) type may have different objectives and [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) levels.

## Regulations and Oversight

### Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB)
The MSRB is a regulatory organization that sets standards for municipal securities. It establishes rules for [broker](../b/broker.md)-dealers and municipal advisors in the [market](../m/market.md).

### Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
The SEC oversees the municipal [bond market](../b/bond_market.md), ensuring [transparency](../t/transparency.md), fairness, and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md). It mandates [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) and enforces securities laws.

### Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
The IRS ensures that tax-exempt bonds adhere to federal tax laws and regulations. Violations can lead to bonds losing their tax-exempt status.

## Conclusion

[Municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md) play an essential role in funding public projects and services, [offering](../o/offering.md) tax benefits and relatively low [risk](../r/risk.md). However, they also come with unique risks and complexities. Investors need to understand the different types of [municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md), their benefits, and their risks to make informed investment decisions.

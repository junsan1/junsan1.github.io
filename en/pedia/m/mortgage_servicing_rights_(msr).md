# Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSR)

[Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) Servicing Rights (MSRs) are a type of [financial asset](../f/financial_asset.md) that grants the holder the right to service a pool of [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) loans. When a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [loan](../l/loan.md) is originated, the [lender](../l/lender.md) typically sells the [loan](../l/loan.md) to an [investor](../i/investor.md) but retains the MSR, or sells both the [loan](../l/loan.md) and MSR. The MSR entitles the servicer to collect servicing fees from these [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) payments, which are a small percentage of the [loan](../l/loan.md) balance.

## Key Components of MSRs

1. **Collection of Payments:**
    The servicer is responsible for collecting monthly [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) payments from borrowers and distributing these payments to the [loan](../l/loan.md) owner, or [investor](../i/investor.md).

2. **[Escrow](../e/escrow.md) Management:**
    The servicer manages [escrow](../e/escrow.md) accounts for property [taxes](../t/taxes.md) and homeownerâ€™s [insurance](../i/insurance.md), ensuring that these are paid on time.

3. **[Customer Service](../c/customer_service.md):**
    The servicer provides support to borrowers, including managing inquiries and handling [delinquent](../d/delinquent.md) accounts.

4. **[Default](../d/default.md) Management:**
    The servicer manages [delinquent](../d/delinquent.md) accounts and initiates loss mitigation processes, like [loan](../l/loan.md) modifications or [foreclosure](../f/foreclosure.md) proceedings.

5. **[Fee](../f/fee.md) Structure:**
    The servicer earns servicing fees, often around 0.25-0.50% of the unpaid [principal](../p/principal.md) balance of the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) loans. They may also earn ancillary fees, such as late [payment](../p/payment.md) penalties.

## Valuation of MSRs

MSRs are complex assets whose [valuation](../v/valuation.md) depends on various factors, including [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, [prepayment](../p/prepayment.md) speeds, and the [credit](../c/credit.md) quality of the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) pool they service. Key points in [valuation](../v/valuation.md) include:

1. **Discounted [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md) (DCF) Analysis:**
    [Valuation models](../v/valuation_models.md) typically involve a discounted [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) analysis, projection of future cash flows based on expected borrower behavior, and [discounting](../d/discounting.md) these cash flows using an appropriate [discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md).

2. **[Interest](../i/interest.md) Rates:**
    [Interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) fluctuations significantly impact MSR values. When [interest](../i/interest.md) rates drop, [prepayment](../p/prepayment.md) speeds generally increase as borrowers [refinance](../r/refinance.md), thereby reducing the [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) from servicing fees.

3. **[Credit](../c/credit.md) Quality:**
    The [credit](../c/credit.md) quality of the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) pool affects the costs related to [default](../d/default.md) management and loss mitigation. Higher [default](../d/default.md) rates can lead to increased expenses and affect the overall profitability of MSRs.

4. **Regulatory Impact:**
    Regulatory changes in the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [market](../m/market.md) can impact MSR values, particularly if new rules alter servicing practices or impose additional costs on servicers.

## Risks Associated with MSRs

1. **[Prepayment Risk](../p/prepayment_risk.md):**
    This is the [risk](../r/risk.md) that borrowers [will](../w/will.md) repay their mortgages ahead of schedule, which reduces the expected [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) from servicing fees.

2. **[Credit Risk](../c/credit_risk.md):**
    [Credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) involves the potential for borrower defaults, leading to increased servicing costs and delayed or foregone [income](../i/income.md).

3. **[Operational Risk](../o/operational_risk.md):**
    The effective management of MSRs requires [robust](../r/robust.md) operational systems and processes. Failures in these processes can lead to legal penalties or financial losses.

4. **[Market Risk](../m/market_risk.md):**
    Changes in [market](../m/market.md) conditions, such as [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) fluctuations, can affect the [value](../v/value.md) of MSRs. 

## Accounting for MSRs

[Accounting](../a/accounting.md) for MSRs involves recognizing them as an [asset](../a/asset.md) on the [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) of the entity holding the rights. Methods include:

1. **Amortization Method:**
    MSRs are recognized at the lower of amortized cost or [fair value](../f/fair_value.md). The initial [value](../v/value.md) is amortized over the projected life of the MSR, and this [value](../v/value.md) is tested for [impairment](../i/impairment.md) periodically.

2. **[Fair Value](../f/fair_value.md) Method:**
    MSRs are recorded at [fair value](../f/fair_value.md), with changes in [value](../v/value.md) recorded in the [income statement](../i/income_statement.md). This method provides more [transparency](../t/transparency.md) regarding current [market](../m/market.md) conditions but introduces more [earnings](../e/earnings.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

## Major Players in the MSR Market

1. **Quicken Loans:**
    Quicken Loans is a leading [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [lender](../l/lender.md) in the U.S. and manages MSRs as part of its [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) servicing operations. More information can be found on their website: [Quicken Loans](https://www.quickenloans.com).

2. **PennyMac:**
    PennyMac is a prominent non-[bank](../b/bank.md) [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [lender](../l/lender.md) and servicer, involved extensively in the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) and management of MSRs. For further details, visit: [PennyMac](https://www.pennymac.com).

3. **New Residential Investment Corp:**
    This company is heavily invested in MSR portfolios and manages a large servicing platform. Visit their page for more info: [New Residential Investment Corp](http://www.newresi.com).

MSRs play a crucial role in ensuring [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) in the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [market](../m/market.md) and [offer](../o/offer.md) a critical [revenue](../r/revenue.md) stream for servicers. However, managing and valuing these assets requires expertise due to the [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [risk factors](../r/risk_factors_in_trading.md) involved.

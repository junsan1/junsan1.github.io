# Matched Orders

In the realm of financial markets, particularly within the context of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), the term "matched orders" represents a critical concept. Matched orders are pairs of buy and sell orders that align perfectly in terms of price and quantity within a trading platform. This alignment allows for the immediate execution of trades, facilitating liquidity and [market efficiency](../m/market_efficiency.md). In [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), matched orders are often the result of sophisticated algorithms designed to find the best possible matches for trade execution in real-time.

## Understanding Matched Orders

Matched orders occur when a buy order from one trader finds an exact counterpart in a sell order from another trader at the same price and volume. This process can happen within traditional stock exchanges, electronic communication networks (ECNs), or alternative [trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md) (ATSs). In a perfectly efficient market, buy and sell orders would match seamlessly, ensuring that trades are executed instantly without price slippage.

### Importance in Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) relies on pre-programmed instructions, or algorithms, which can initiate orders based on various parameters such as timing, price, and quantity. The goal for many algorithmic traders is to minimize the market impact and maximize execution efficiency, often by placing orders strategically to match with existing orders in the market.

### Liquidity and Market Efficiency

Matched orders are fundamental to liquidity and [market efficiency](../m/market_efficiency.md). Liquidity refers to the ease with which an asset can be bought or sold without affecting its price. High liquidity indicates that there are plenty of orders available for immediate execution. Matched orders contribute to this by ensuring that there is a continuous alignment of buy and sell orders, which helps in maintaining stable prices and reducing volatility.

## Mechanisms of Matched Orders

### Central Limit Order Book (CLOB)

The most common mechanism for matching orders in modern financial markets is the Central [Limit Order Book](../l/limit_order_book.md) (CLOB). A CLOB is an electronic list of buy and sell orders for a financial instrument, organized by price level. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Order Submission**: Traders submit buy and sell orders to the exchange.
2. **Order Sorting**: Orders are sorted and prioritized based on price and time of submission.
3. **Order Matching**: The system matches buy and sell orders at each price level.
4. **Trade Execution**: Matched orders are executed, and the trades are confirmed.

### Electronic Communication Networks (ECNs)

Electronic Communication Networks are automated systems that match orders electronically. ECNs are particularly popular in forex and equity markets for their efficiency and speed. They operate by:

1. **Aggregating Orders**: Collecting orders from various participants including individual traders, institutions, and brokers.
2. **Matching Criteria**: Using algorithms to match buy and sell orders based on predefined criteria.
3. **Anonymous Trading**: Allowing traders to remain anonymous, promoting fair and transparent trading.

### Dark Pools

[Dark pools](../d/dark_pools.md) are private financial forums or exchanges for trading securities. They allow institutional investors to trade large blocks of shares without divulging their intentions to the public markets. [Dark pools](../d/dark_pools.md) match orders in a less transparent manner compared to public exchanges, which can be advantageous for large trades needing minimal market impact.

## Types of Matched Orders

### Limit Orders

A limit order is an order to buy or sell a stock at a specific price or better. When a limit buy order and a limit sell order match at the same price point, a matched order is executed. For instance, if Trader A places a limit buy order at $100 and Trader B places a limit sell order at $100, the orders match and the trade is executed.

### Market Orders

Market orders are orders to buy or sell a stock at the best available current price. When a market buy order matches with a market sell order at the prevailing market price, the trade is executed. Market orders prioritize speed of execution over price.

### Stop Orders

Stop orders become market orders once a specified stop price is reached. For example, a stop buy order at $105 will convert to a market order once the stock reaches $105, seeking immediate execution at the next available price.

## Strategies Involving Matched Orders

### Market Making

Market makers provide liquidity by placing both buy and sell limit orders in the market. Their goal is to earn the [bid-ask spread](../b/bid-ask_spread.md). Market makers' algorithms constantly adjust orders to match with incoming market orders, ensuring trades are executed efficiently.

### Arbitrage

[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) involves taking advantage of price discrepancies between different markets or instruments. Algorithms identify opportunities for [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) by constantly scanning for matched orders that allow for risk-free profit.

### Statistical Arbitrage

Statistical [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) employs [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md) to identify trading opportunities. These models look for statistical relationships between different securities and place orders to capitalize on these relationships when certain conditions are met. For instance, if two correlated stocks diverge in price, the algorithm might generate matched orders to buy the underperforming stock and sell the outperforming one.

### High-Frequency Trading (HFT)

HFT strategies involve executing a large number of orders at extremely high speeds. Algorithms place and match orders within milliseconds to capitalize on minute price movements. HFT relies heavily on the ability to quickly find matched orders to capitalize on the tiniest price inconsistencies.

## Risks and Considerations

### Latency

Latency refers to the delay between order submission and execution. High latency can lead to missed opportunities or unfavorable trade execution, especially in HFT. Traders must ensure their infrastructure minimizes latency to successfully execute matched orders.

### Price Manipulation

Matched orders can be susceptible to manipulative strategies such as spoofing, where a trader places fake orders to create a false sense of demand or supply. Regulatory bodies monitor such activities to ensure market integrity.

### Order Book Depth

The depth of the order book, or the number of buy and sell orders at each price level, influences the likelihood of finding matched orders. Thin order books may lead to less efficient order matching and greater price volatility.

### Regulatory Compliance

Traders must adhere to regulatory requirements governing order matching and trading practices. Compliance ensures that the order matching process is fair and transparent, protecting the interests of all market participants.

# Matched Orders

In the realm of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), particularly within the context of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), the term "matched orders" represents a critical concept. Matched orders are pairs of buy and sell orders that align perfectly in terms of price and quantity within a [trading platform](../t/trading_platform.md). This alignment allows for the immediate [execution](../e/execution.md) of trades, facilitating [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and [market efficiency](../m/market_efficiency.md). In [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), matched orders are often the result of sophisticated algorithms designed to find the best possible matches for [trade](../t/trade.md) [execution](../e/execution.md) in real-time.

## Understanding Matched Orders

Matched orders occur when a buy [order](../o/order.md) from one [trader](../t/trader.md) finds an exact counterpart in a sell [order](../o/order.md) from another [trader](../t/trader.md) at the same price and [volume](../v/volume.md). This process can happen within traditional stock exchanges, electronic communication networks (ECNs), or alternative [trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md) (ATSs). In a perfectly efficient [market](../m/market.md), buy and sell orders would match seamlessly, ensuring that trades are executed instantly without price [slippage](../s/slippage.md).

### Importance in Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) relies on pre-programmed instructions, or algorithms, which can initiate orders based on various parameters such as timing, price, and quantity. The goal for many algorithmic traders is to minimize the [market](../m/market.md) impact and maximize [execution](../e/execution.md) [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md), often by placing orders strategically to match with existing orders in the [market](../m/market.md).

### Liquidity and Market Efficiency

Matched orders are fundamental to [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and [market efficiency](../m/market_efficiency.md). [Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) refers to the ease with which an [asset](../a/asset.md) can be bought or sold without affecting its price. High [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) indicates that there are plenty of orders available for immediate [execution](../e/execution.md). Matched orders contribute to this by ensuring that there is a continuous alignment of buy and sell orders, which helps in maintaining stable prices and reducing [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

## Mechanisms of Matched Orders

### Central Limit Order Book (CLOB)

The most common mechanism for [matching orders](../m/matching_orders.md) in modern [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) is the Central [Limit Order Book](../l/limit_order_book.md) (CLOB). A CLOB is an electronic list of buy and sell orders for a [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md), organized by [price level](../p/price_level.md). Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **[Order](../o/order.md) Submission**: Traders submit buy and sell orders to the [exchange](../e/exchange.md).
2. **[Order](../o/order.md) Sorting**: Orders are sorted and prioritized based on price and time of submission.
3. **[Order](../o/order.md) Matching**: The system matches buy and sell orders at each [price level](../p/price_level.md).
4. **[Trade](../t/trade.md) [Execution](../e/execution.md)**: Matched orders are executed, and the trades are confirmed.

### Electronic Communication Networks (ECNs)

Electronic Communication Networks are automated systems that match orders electronically. ECNs are particularly popular in forex and [equity](../e/equity.md) markets for their [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and speed. They operate by:

1. **Aggregating Orders**: Collecting orders from various participants including individual traders, institutions, and brokers.
2. **Matching Criteria**: Using algorithms to match buy and sell orders based on predefined criteria.
3. **Anonymous Trading**: Allowing traders to remain anonymous, promoting fair and transparent trading.

### Dark Pools

[Dark pools](../d/dark_pools.md) are private financial forums or exchanges for trading securities. They allow institutional investors to [trade](../t/trade.md) large blocks of [shares](../s/shares.md) without divulging their intentions to the public markets. [Dark pools](../d/dark_pools.md) match orders in a less transparent manner compared to public exchanges, which can be advantageous for large trades needing minimal [market](../m/market.md) impact.

## Types of Matched Orders

### Limit Orders

A [limit order](../l/limit_order.md) is an [order](../o/order.md) to buy or sell a stock at a specific price or better. When a limit buy [order](../o/order.md) and a limit sell [order](../o/order.md) match at the same price point, a matched [order](../o/order.md) is executed. For instance, if [Trader](../t/trader.md) A places a limit buy [order](../o/order.md) at $100 and [Trader](../t/trader.md) B places a limit sell [order](../o/order.md) at $100, the orders match and the [trade](../t/trade.md) is executed.

### Market Orders

[Market](../m/market.md) orders are orders to buy or sell a stock at the best available current price. When a [market](../m/market.md) buy [order](../o/order.md) matches with a [market](../m/market.md) sell [order](../o/order.md) at the prevailing [market price](../m/market_price.md), the [trade](../t/trade.md) is executed. [Market](../m/market.md) orders prioritize speed of [execution](../e/execution.md) over price.

### Stop Orders

Stop orders become [market](../m/market.md) orders once a specified stop price is reached. For example, a stop buy [order](../o/order.md) at $105 [will](../w/will.md) convert to a [market order](../m/market_order.md) once the stock reaches $105, seeking immediate [execution](../e/execution.md) at the next available price.

## Strategies Involving Matched Orders

### Market Making

[Market](../m/market.md) makers provide [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) by placing both buy and sell limit orders in the [market](../m/market.md). Their goal is to earn the [bid-ask spread](../b/bid-ask_spread.md). [Market](../m/market.md) makers' algorithms constantly adjust orders to match with incoming [market](../m/market.md) orders, ensuring trades are executed efficiently.

### Arbitrage

[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) involves taking advantage of price discrepancies between different markets or instruments. Algorithms identify opportunities for [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) by constantly scanning for matched orders that allow for [risk](../r/risk.md)-free [profit](../p/profit.md).

### Statistical Arbitrage

Statistical [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) employs [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md) to identify trading opportunities. These models look for statistical relationships between different securities and place orders to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on these relationships when certain conditions are met. For instance, if two correlated [stocks](../s/stock.md) diverge in price, the algorithm might generate matched orders to buy the underperforming stock and sell the outperforming one.

### High-Frequency Trading (HFT)

HFT strategies involve executing a large number of orders at extremely high speeds. Algorithms place and match orders within milliseconds to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on minute price movements. HFT relies heavily on the ability to quickly find matched orders to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on the tiniest price inconsistencies.

## Risks and Considerations

### Latency

Latency refers to the delay between [order](../o/order.md) submission and [execution](../e/execution.md). High latency can lead to missed opportunities or unfavorable [trade](../t/trade.md) [execution](../e/execution.md), especially in HFT. Traders must ensure their [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) minimizes latency to successfully execute matched orders.

### Price Manipulation

Matched orders can be susceptible to manipulative strategies such as [spoofing](../s/spoofing.md), where a [trader](../t/trader.md) places fake orders to create a false sense of [demand](../d/demand.md) or [supply](../s/supply.md). Regulatory bodies monitor such activities to ensure [market](../m/market.md) integrity.

### Order Book Depth

The depth of the [order book](../o/order_book.md), or the number of buy and sell orders at each [price level](../p/price_level.md), influences the likelihood of finding matched orders. Thin [order](../o/order.md) books may lead to less efficient [order](../o/order.md) matching and greater price [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

### Regulatory Compliance

Traders must adhere to regulatory requirements governing [order](../o/order.md) matching and trading practices. Compliance ensures that the [order](../o/order.md) matching process is fair and transparent, protecting the interests of all [market](../m/market.md) participants.

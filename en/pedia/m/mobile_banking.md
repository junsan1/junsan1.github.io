# Mobile Banking

Mobile banking is a service provided by financial institutions that allows customers to conduct a [range](../r/range.md) of financial transactions remotely using a mobile device such as a smartphone or tablet.

### Smartphone Era
The advent of smartphones and the proliferation of mobile internet bandwidth profoundly transformed mobile banking. With the introduction of the Apple iPhone in 2007 and the subsequent rise of Android devices, financial institutions began developing mobile applications that offered a richer, more interactive banking experience.

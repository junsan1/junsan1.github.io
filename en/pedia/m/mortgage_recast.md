# Mortgage Recast

A [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) recast, also known as a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) re-amortization, is a process where a borrower pays a large sum towards the [principal](../p/principal.md) balance of their [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md), and the [lender](../l/lender.md) recalculates the remaining balance into a new [amortization schedule](../a/amortization.md). The result is a lower monthly [payment](../p/payment.md) while keeping the original [loan](../l/loan.md) term intact. This financial maneuver is an alternative to refinancing and can be advantageous for borrowers who come into a significant amount of [money](../m/money.md), such as through a bonus, inheritance, or the [sale](../s/sale.md) of an [asset](../a/asset.md).

## How Mortgage Recast Works

When a borrower decides to recast their [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md), they contact their [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) servicer to request the process. A substantial [lump-sum payment](../l/lump-sum_payment.md) is made towards the [principal](../p/principal.md) balance of their [loan](../l/loan.md). The servicer then recalculates the remaining [loan](../l/loan.md) balance over the remaining term, leading to reduced monthly payments. Unlike refinancing, a recast does not require a new [loan](../l/loan.md) application, [appraisal](../a/appraisal.md), or closing costs, which often makes it a simpler and more cost-effective option.

For instance, if a borrower has a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) with a [principal](../p/principal.md) balance of $250,000 at 4% [interest](../i/interest.md) with 20 years remaining and decides to recast by making a $50,000 lump sum [payment](../p/payment.md), the [lender](../l/lender.md) recalculates the [loan](../l/loan.md). The new [principal](../p/principal.md) balance of $200,000 spread over the remaining 20 years [will](../w/will.md) have significantly lower monthly payments due to the reduction in the [principal](../p/principal.md) amount.

## Benefits of Mortgage Recast

### Lower Monthly Payments

One of the primary benefits of a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) recast is the reduction in monthly payments. By making a [lump-sum payment](../l/lump-sum_payment.md) towards the [principal](../p/principal.md), the borrower reduces the amount of [money](../m/money.md) owed, which when re-amortized over the remaining term, leads to smaller payments. This can improve [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) for the borrower, making it more manageable to meet monthly [obligations](../o/obligation.md).

### Lower Interest Cost

Since the [principal](../p/principal.md) balance is reduced, the amount on which [interest](../i/interest.md) is calculated also decreases. Over time, this can result in significant savings on [interest](../i/interest.md) costs. However, it is important to [note](../n/note.md) that this is different from refinancing to a lower [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md), as the rate in a recast remains the same.

### No Need for Refinancing

Recasting a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) does not involve many of the steps required in refinancing, such as application processes, appraisals, and closing costs. This makes the process quick, straightforward, and less expensive compared to refinancing [options](../o/options.md).

## Requirements and Eligibility

Not all loans or lenders [offer](../o/offer.md) the option to recast a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md). Borrowers must verify if their [loan](../l/loan.md) is eligible for recasting by contacting their [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) servicer. Conventional conforming loans usually present this option, but FHA, VA, and USDA loans do not typically allow for [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) recasting.

The amount of the [lump-sum payment](../l/lump-sum_payment.md) required for a recast varies depending on the [lender](../l/lender.md). Some lenders may require a minimum amount, frequently around $5,000 to $10,000, to be eligible for recasting. Furthermore, the servicer may charge a [fee](../f/fee.md) for processing the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) recast, which can [range](../r/range.md) from $150 to $500.

## Mortgage Recast vs. Refinancing

### Differences

While both [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) recasting and refinancing are strategies to manage [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) payments, they differ significantly in terms of process and outcomes.

#### Recasting:
- **[Principal](../p/principal.md) Reduction:** Involves making a significant [lump-sum payment](../l/lump-sum_payment.md) toward the [principal](../p/principal.md).
- **[Interest Rate](../i/interest_rate.md):** The original [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) remains [unchanged](../u/unchanged.md).
- **Cost:** Generally incurs a [nominal](../n/nominal.md) [fee](../f/fee.md).
- **Eligibility:** Not available for all types of loans (e.g., not for FHA, VA, USDA loans).

#### Refinancing:
- **[Principal](../p/principal.md) Structure:** May involve changing the [loan](../l/loan.md) structure entirely.
- **[Interest Rate](../i/interest_rate.md):** Can result in a lower [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) if [market](../m/market.md) conditions are favorable.
- **Cost:** Involves significant costs such as [appraisal](../a/appraisal.md) fees, [origination](../o/origination.md) fees, and closing costs.
- **Eligibility:** [Open](../o/open.md) to all types of loans but dependent on [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) and other factors.

### When to Choose Which

Borrowers should consider their financial situation, current [market](../m/market.md) conditions, and long-term goals when choosing between a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) recast and refinancing. 

* Recasting may be more suitable for borrowers who have a significant lump sum to reduce their [principal](../p/principal.md) and wish to lower their monthly payments without altering their [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) or incurring substantial costs.
* Refinancing may be a better option for borrowers looking to reduce their [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md), change the [loan](../l/loan.md) term, or switch from an adjustable-rate [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) (ARM) to a [fixed-rate mortgage](../f/fixed-rate_mortgage.md).

## Scenario Examples

### Scenario 1: Inheritance

Suppose a borrower with a remaining [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) balance of $300,000 receives an inheritance of $75,000. The borrower decides to use the inheritance to make a [lump-sum payment](../l/lump-sum_payment.md) towards the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md). After the recast, the new [principal](../p/principal.md) balance is $225,000, and the monthly payments are recalculated, resulting in lower monthly payments.

### Scenario 2: Bonus from Work

Consider a borrower with an original [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) balance of $400,000. The borrower receives an annual bonus of $50,000. By using this bonus to recast the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md), the borrower can reduce their monthly payments significantly while retaining the same [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) and [loan](../l/loan.md) term.

## Steps to Mortgage Recast

1. **Review [Loan](../l/loan.md) Agreement:** Ensure that recasting is allowed by reviewing the [loan](../l/loan.md) agreement or contacting the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) servicer.
2. **Gather Required Documentation:** Prepare necessary documents such as [loan](../l/loan.md) statements and proof of funds for the [lump-sum payment](../l/lump-sum_payment.md).
3. **Request Recast:** Contact the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) servicer to formally request a recast and inquire about any fees involved.
4. **Make [Lump-Sum Payment](../l/lump-sum_payment.md):** Provide the [lump-sum payment](../l/lump-sum_payment.md) towards the [principal](../p/principal.md) balance.
5. **Recalculation:** The [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) servicer recalculates the monthly payments based on the new [principal](../p/principal.md) balance.
6. **Confirmation:** Receive confirmation of the new monthly [payment](../p/payment.md) amount and updated [amortization schedule](../a/amortization.md) from the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) servicer.

## Financial Impact

### Positive Impact

- **Increased [Equity](../e/equity.md):** A recast [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) increases [home equity](../h/home_equity.md), as the [principal](../p/principal.md) balance is reduced.
- **Improved [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md):** Lower monthly payments ease financial pressure and provide more [disposable income](../d/disposable_income.md).

### Neutral/Negative Impact

- **[Interest Rate](../i/interest_rate.md) Remains the Same:** Borrowers do not benefit from potentially lower [market](../m/market.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) rates available through refinancing.
- **[Opportunity Cost](../o/opportunity_cost.md):** Utilizing a significant amount of funds for the [lump-sum payment](../l/lump-sum_payment.md) may result in less [money](../m/money.md) available for other investments or emergencies.

## Conclusion

[Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) recasting is a valuable tool for borrowers looking to reduce their monthly [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) payments without going through the more complex process of refinancing. By understanding the eligibility requirements, potential benefits, and comparing alternatives, borrowers can make informed decisions that align with their financial goals. To explore the possibility of recasting or to initiate the process, borrowers can reach out to their [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) servicer or [financial advisor](../f/financial_advisor.md) for [guidance](../g/guidance.md).

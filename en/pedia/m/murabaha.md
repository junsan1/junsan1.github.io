# Murabaha

Murabaha is an Islamic [financing](../f/financing.md) structure in which the seller provides the cost and [profit margin](../p/profit_margin.md) of a [commodity](../c/commodity.md) or product to the buyer. It represents an Islamic way of banking in compliance with Islamic laws (Sharia). It’s often compared to lending at an agreed-upon [profit margin](../p/profit_margin.md), making it similar in practice to cost-plus [financing](../f/financing.md). 

Primarily used in [Islamic banking](../i/islamic_banking.md) and by Islamic [finance](../f/finance.md) institutions, Murabaha is a non-[interest](../i/interest.md)-based [financing](../f/financing.md). Instead of charging [interest](../i/interest.md) on the [loan](../l/loan.md) amount (which is prohibited by Islamic law), lenders earn profits on the cost of goods sold, making Murabaha one of the most popular [financing](../f/financing.md) methods in the [Islamic banking](../i/islamic_banking.md) sector.

## Components and Process of Murabaha

In a Murabaha agreement, the following steps are usually taken:

1. **Purchase Request:** The buyer requests the [bank](../b/bank.md) to purchase a specific [commodity](../c/commodity.md).
2. **Agreement:** The [bank](../b/bank.md) agrees to purchase this [asset](../a/asset.md) and arranges to sell it to the buyer at the original purchase price plus a [profit margin](../p/profit_margin.md) determined by the [bank](../b/bank.md).
3. **Purchase and Resale:** The [bank](../b/bank.md) then purchases the [commodity](../c/commodity.md) from a third-party seller and immediately resells it to the buyer with a markup price as stipulated in the agreement.
4. **[Repayment](../r/repayment.md):** The buyer pays back the agreed-upon price over a specified period in installments or as a lump sum.

### Example

Consider a [business](../b/business.md) wishing to procure machinery valued at $100,000. Under Murabaha, the [bank](../b/bank.md) [will](../w/will.md) purchase the machinery and sell it to the [business](../b/business.md) at a mark-up price; let's say $110,000, payable in installments over five years. This markup represents the [bank](../b/bank.md)’s [profit](../p/profit.md) for the [financing](../f/financing.md). 

## Advantages of Murabaha

1. **[Transparency](../t/transparency.md):** Both the buyer and seller know the cost and the [profit margin](../p/profit_margin.md), ensuring [transparency](../t/transparency.md) within the [transaction](../t/transaction.md).
2. **Simplicity:** The structure of Murabaha is straightforward and easy to understand, making it widely accessible.
3. **Fixed Pricing:** Buyers benefit from fixed [repayment](../r/repayment.md) amounts, reducing [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) compared to variable [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

## Disadvantages of Murabaha

1. **Higher Costs:** Compared to conventional loans, the overall cost can be higher due to the markup.
2. **Non-Flexibility:** The fixed [repayment](../r/repayment.md) schedules often lack flexibility, limiting [options](../o/options.md) for borrowers facing financial difficulties.
3. **Not Ideal for Cash [Financing](../f/financing.md):** Since Murabaha is tied to [tangible assets](../t/tangible_asset.md), it might not be suitable for individuals or entities needing cash without specific use for goods.

## Differences Between Murabaha and Traditional Loans

1. **[Interest](../i/interest.md)-Free:** Unlike conventional loans that charge [interest](../i/interest.md), Murabaha [financing](../f/financing.md) charges a fixed [profit margin](../p/profit_margin.md).
2. **[Asset](../a/asset.md)-Based:** Murabaha transactions are always tied to commodities or [tangible assets](../t/tangible_asset.md).
3. **Ownership:** The financier ([bank](../b/bank.md)) owns the [asset](../a/asset.md) until it is sold to the buyer at the agreed price.

## Roles in Murabaha

### Buyer

The buyer, individual or corporate, needs goods or commodities but lacks the immediate funds to purchase them outright. In a Murabaha agreement, buyers benefit from accessible [financing](../f/financing.md) without violating Islamic principles.

### Bank/Financier

Banks, acting as financiers, facilitate the [transaction](../t/transaction.md) by purchasing the required goods and reselling them to the buyer at a [profit](../p/profit.md). This structure allows Islamic banks to engage in [trade finance](../t/trade_finance.md) while adhering to Islamic values against [interest](../i/interest.md) [earnings](../e/earnings.md).

### Seller

The third-party seller supplies the actual commodities needed by the buyer. This party sells the goods to the [bank](../b/bank.md), which in turn resells them to the ultimate buyer.

## Types of Murabaha

### Commodity Murabaha

This involves trading commodities, such as metals or agricultural products. [Commodity](../c/commodity.md) Murabaha transactions enable buyers to [finance](../f/finance.md) [raw materials](../r/raw_materials.md) or other essential commodities for their [business](../b/business.md).

### Retail Murabaha

Retail Murabaha is typically for consumer products, including automobiles, electronics, or household goods, allowing consumers to buy high-cost items in a Sharia-compliant manner.

## Regulatory Framework

Regulatory bodies globally are increasingly recognizing the importance of accommodating Islamic [financing](../f/financing.md). Countries with significant Muslim populations often have specialized frameworks for [Islamic banking](../i/islamic_banking.md), implicitly supporting Murabaha.

### AAOIFI Standards

The [Accounting](../a/accounting.md) and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI) outlines the standards for Murabaha, ensuring uniformity and adherence to Sharia principles in its application.

## Applications in FinTech and Algo-Trading

While Murabaha functions traditionally in the banking sector, it has found applications in the FinTech space:

1. **[Blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md):** Leveraging [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology for Murabaha transactions ensures [transparency](../t/transparency.md), and immutable records, facilitating smoother cross-border transactions.
  
2. **[Algorithmic Trading](../a/accountability.md):** Algorithms designed for Sharia-compliant trading can incorporate Murabaha structures for automated, compliant trades.

Several companies are leading in [offering](../o/offering.md) Murabaha-based products using technology:

- **Emirates Islamic:** Offers Murabaha facilities for personal, auto, and [home](../h/home.md) [financing](../f/financing.md). More information can be found on their [website](https://www.emiratesislamic.ae/eng/).
  
- **Qatar Islamic [Bank](../b/bank.md):** Provides comprehensive Murabaha [financing](../f/financing.md) solutions, the details of which are available on their [website](http://www.qib.com.qa/).

## Conclusion

Murabaha stands out as a pivotal concept in Islamic [finance](../f/finance.md), [offering](../o/offering.md) an alternative to [interest](../i/interest.md)-based lending. Its application spans traditional banking services to modern FinTech solutions, adapting well to various sectors while adhering to Sharia principles. The continued evolution of Murabaha indicates its integral role in accommodating the financial needs of individuals and businesses while maintaining [ethical standards](../e/ethical_standards_in_trading.md).

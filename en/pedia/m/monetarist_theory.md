# Monetarist Theory

Monetarist theory is an economic school of thought that emphasizes the role of governments in controlling the amount of [money](../m/money.md) in circulation. Unlike other economic theories, [monetarism](../m/monetarism.md) places significant importance on the [supply](../s/supply.md) of [money](../m/money.md) as the primary driver of economic activity and [inflation](../i/inflation.md). The theory gained prominence during the latter half of the 20th century, largely due to the advocacy of [economist](../e/economist.md) [Milton Friedman](../m/milton_friedman.md).

Monetarist theory argues that variations in the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) have major influences on national output in the [short run](../s/short_run.md) and the [price level](../p/price_level.md) over longer periods. The theory fundamentally rests on the [Quantity Theory of Money](../q/quantity_theory_of_money.md), which posits a direct relationship between the quantity of [money](../m/money.md) in an [economy](../e/economy.md) and the level of prices of goods and services sold.

## Foundations of Monetarist Theory

### Quantity Theory of Money

At the heart of monetarist theory is the [Quantity Theory of Money](../q/quantity_theory_of_money.md) (QTM). This theory is typically expressed with the equation:

\[ MV = PQ \]

Where:
- \( M \) = [Money supply](../m/money_supply.md)
- \( V \) = [Velocity of money](../v/velocity_of_money.md) (how fast [money](../m/money.md) circulates)
- \( P \) = [Price level](../p/price_level.md)
- \( Q \) = Real output (goods and services produced)

According to QTM, if the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) \( M \) increases, and if the [velocity of money](../v/velocity_of_money.md) \( V \) and the real output \( Q \) remain constant, then the [price level](../p/price_level.md) \( P \) [will](../w/will.md) increase. This is the essence of the monetarist view on [inflation](../i/inflation.md): it's primarily caused by increases in the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md).

### Milton Friedman and Natural Rate of Unemployment

[Milton Friedman](../m/milton_friedman.md), often considered the leading figure in monetarist theory, introduced the concept of the "natural rate of [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md)." He argued that there is a specific level of [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) that the [economy](../e/economy.md) naturally gravitates towards, which he termed the "natural rate." According to Friedman, any attempts by government to reduce [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) below this natural rate through [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) would only lead to accelerating [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

### Long-term Neutrality of Money

Another cornerstone of monetarist theory is the long-term [neutrality of money](../n/neutrality_of_money.md). This concept asserts that changes in the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) only affect prices and wages in the [long run](../l/long_run.md), without impacting real variables like output or employment. Hence, while [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) can influence the [economy](../e/economy.md) in the short term, its long-term effect is primarily on the [price level](../p/price_level.md), not on real [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md).

## Key Tenets

### Emphasis on Controlling the Money Supply

Monetarists argue that the most reliable way for governments to manage economic stability is through controlling the growth rate of the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md). Friedman suggested a fixed annual increase in the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) (a monetarist rule) to achieve steady [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) and maintain price stability. According to monetarists, discretionary monetary policies often lead to inefficiency and economic instability due to timing lags and unpredictable policy impacts.

### Rejection of Fiscal Policy

Monetarists generally regard [fiscal policy](../f/fiscal_policy.md)—government spending and [taxation](../t/taxation.md)—as less effective than [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) in managing the [economy](../e/economy.md). They argue that fiscal interventions can crowd out private investment and lead to higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, while also being subject to political influences that can cause erratic economic results. The monetarist preference is for minimal government intervention in the [economy](../e/economy.md).

### Inflation is Always and Everywhere a Monetary Phenomenon

Friedman famously asserted that "[inflation](../i/inflation.md) is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon." By this, he meant that sustained [inflation](../i/inflation.md) is the result of increasing the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) more rapidly than the growth of real output. Therefore, controlling [inflation](../i/inflation.md) requires controlling the growth rate of the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md).

## Monetary Policy and Its Implications

### Rules-Based Policy vs. Discretionary Policy

One of the major debates in monetarist thought involves whether [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) should be rules-based or discretionary. Monetarists advocate for a rules-based policy where guidelines dictate the growth rate of the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md), such as the Friedman [k-percent rule](../k/k-percent_rule.md). They argue that rules-based policies are more predictable and less subject to the vicissitudes of political decision-making.

### The Role of Central Banks

In monetarist theory, central banks play a pivotal role in controlling the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md). Monetarists support the idea of central [bank](../b/bank.md) independence, free from political pressure to enact policies that could lead to short-term gains but long-term detriment. Central banks, by adhering to a predetermined rule for monetary growth, can effectively stabilize the [economy](../e/economy.md).

### Criticisms of Monetarist Theory

While monetarist theory has had significant influence, it has also faced criticism. Critics argue that the [velocity of money](../v/velocity_of_money.md) is not constant and can fluctuate, making the simple relationship proposed by the [Quantity Theory of Money](../q/quantity_theory_of_money.md) unreliable. Additionally, some economists point out that focusing exclusively on the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) ignores other important factors influencing economic performance, such as technology, [capital](../c/capital.md), and [labor productivity](../l/labor_productivity.md).

## Monetarism in Practice

### The Case of the Federal Reserve

The Federal Reserve, the central [bank](../b/bank.md) of the United States, has historically shown an oscillation between discretionary and rules-based policies. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, under the chairmanship of Paul Volcker, the Federal Reserve adopted monetarist principles to combat the high [inflation](../i/inflation.md) of the period. The central [bank](../b/bank.md) significantly tightened the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md), leading to a sharp reduction in [inflation](../i/inflation.md), though at the cost of a severe [recession](../r/recession.md).

### International Examples

Other countries have also experimented with monetarist policies. For instance, the [Bank](../b/bank.md) of England adopted monetarist strategies during the early 1980s, focusing on controlling [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) growth to curb [inflation](../i/inflation.md). New Zealand and Canada have also incorporated aspects of monetarist theory into their economic policies.

### Contemporary Relevance

While pure [monetarism](../m/monetarism.md) is less dominant today, its principles continue to influence modern macroeconomic policy. Central banks worldwide often focus on [inflation](../i/inflation.md) targeting, a concept derived from monetarist thought, which involves adjusting [interest](../i/interest.md) rates to control [inflation](../i/inflation.md) and indirectly manage the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md).

## Conclusion

Monetarist theory has made enduring contributions to economic thought and policy-making. By emphasizing the importance of the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) in driving economic performance and [inflation](../i/inflation.md), [monetarism](../m/monetarism.md) provides a framework for understanding the roles of [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) and central banking. Despite criticisms and the evolving nature of [economics](../e/economics.md), the core tenets of [monetarism](../m/monetarism.md) remain influential in shaping how policymakers approach economic stability and growth. For more on [monetarism](../m/monetarism.md) and its applications, you can refer to the work of [Milton Friedman](../m/milton_friedman.md) and the Chicago School of [Economics](../e/economics.md), which continues to propagate these ideas today.

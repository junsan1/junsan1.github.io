# Market-Cap Weighted Index

A **[market](../m/market.md)-cap [weighted](../w/weighted.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md)**, also known as a [capitalization](../c/capitalization.md)-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md), is a type of stock [market index](../m/market_index.md) in which individual components are [weighted](../w/weighted.md) according to their [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md)—meaning, the total [market value](../m/market_value.md) of a company's outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md). This means that the [stocks](../s/stock.md) with the largest [market](../m/market.md) caps have the greatest influence on the performance of the [index](../i/index_instrument.md).

### Understanding Market Capitalization

Before diving deeper into [market](../m/market.md)-cap-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) indexes, it's pivotal to grasp the concept of [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md):

- **[Market Capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md)** = Number of Outstanding [Shares](../s/shares.md) × Current [Market Price](../m/market_price.md) of One Share

[Market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md), or [market](../m/market.md) cap, is a measure of a company's overall [value](../v/value.md) as determined by the [stock market](../s/stock_market.md). It represents the total dollar [market value](../m/market_value.md) of a company's outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md) and is used to rank the size of companies rather than using sales or total [asset](../a/asset.md) figures. Companies are often divided into large-cap, [mid-cap](../m/mid-cap.md), and small-cap based on their [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md).

- **Large-Cap**: Companies with a [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) of $10 billion or more.
- **[Mid-Cap](../m/mid-cap.md)**: Companies with a [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) between $2 billion and $10 billion.
- **Small-Cap**: Companies with a [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) of less than $2 billion.

### How Market-Cap Weighted Indexes Work

In a [market](../m/market.md)-cap-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md), each stock is represented in proportion to its [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md). To calculate the [index](../i/index_instrument.md), each stock’s [market](../m/market.md) cap is determined and then weighed against the total [market](../m/market.md) cap of all the [stocks](../s/stock.md) in the [index](../i/index_instrument.md). The formula for a [market](../m/market.md)-cap-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md) can generally be represented as:

- **[Index](../i/index_instrument.md) [Value](../v/value.md)** = (Current [Market Value](../m/market_value.md) of the [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) / Base [Market Value](../m/market_value.md) of the [Index](../i/index_instrument.md)) × Base [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) [Value](../v/value.md)

The **Current [Market Value](../m/market_value.md) of the [Index](../i/index_instrument.md)** is the sum of the [market](../m/market.md) values of all the [stocks](../s/stock.md) within the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) at a given time. The **Base [Market Value](../m/market_value.md) of the [Index](../i/index_instrument.md)** is the sum of the [market](../m/market.md) values of all the [stocks](../s/stock.md) in the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) at its inception. The **Base [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) [Value](../v/value.md)** is the arbitrary [value](../v/value.md), often 100, assigned to the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) at the time of inception to make it a more workable number.

### Examples of Market-Cap Weighted Indexes

[Market](../m/market.md)-cap [weighted](../w/weighted.md) indexes are prevalent and form the backbone of stock [market performance analysis](../m/market_performance_analysis.md). Here are some major examples:

#### S&P 500

The S&P 500 [index](../i/index_instrument.md) is one of the most well-known [market](../m/market.md)-cap-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) indexes globally. This [index](../i/index_instrument.md) includes 500 of the largest companies [listed](../l/listed.md) on stock exchanges in the United States.

#### NASDAQ-100

The [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md)-100 [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) comprises 100 of the largest non-financial companies [listed](../l/listed.md) on the [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md) [stock market](../s/stock_market.md). It includes [industry](../i/industry.md) leaders in technology as well as non-tech sectors.

#### FTSE 100

The FTSE 100 [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) includes the 100 companies [listed](../l/listed.md) on the London Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) with the highest [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md).

### Advantages of Market-Cap Weighted Indexes

#### Reflects Market Movements

[Market](../m/market.md)-cap [weighted](../w/weighted.md) indexes automatically adjust to reflect changes in stock prices. As a company's stock price rises or falls, its [market](../m/market.md) cap does the same, which recalibrates its impact on the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) accordingly. 

#### Ease of Replication

These indexes are easy to replicate through [index](../i/index_instrument.md) funds and ETFs, allowing investors to mimetically [gain](../g/gain.md) from broad [market](../m/market.md) trends by efficiently [investing](../i/investing.md) in a diversified portfolio.

#### Reduces Frequent Rebalancing

Since [market](../m/market.md)-cap weighting automatically adjusts by price movement of the constituent [stocks](../s/stock.md), it minimizes the need for frequent [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) actions compared to other methodologies.

### Disadvantages of Market-Cap Weighted Indexes

#### Over-Concentration in Large-Cap Stocks

One critical disadvantage is the potential over-concentration in [large-cap stocks](../l/large_cap_stocks.md). This may lead the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) to be disproportionately influenced by the movements of the largest companies, reducing the impact of smaller [stocks](../s/stock.md)' performance on the [index](../i/index_instrument.md).

#### Bubble Risk

Heavy weighting of top-performing [stocks](../s/stock.md) can sometimes inflate [valuation](../v/valuation.md) [bubbles](../b/bubble.md). If larger companies are [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md), the entire [index](../i/index_instrument.md) could be considered to be at high [risk](../r/risk.md) of [correction](../c/correction.md) once those [stocks](../s/stock.md) adjust in price.

#### Limited Exposure to Small-Cap Stocks

Smaller companies may be underrepresented in a [market](../m/market.md)-cap [weighted](../w/weighted.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md). These companies, which sometimes [offer](../o/offer.md) higher growth potential, could be inadequately [weighted](../w/weighted.md) despite their potentially high returns.

### Alternatives to Market-Cap Weighted Indexes

To address the drawbacks, various alternatives to [market](../m/market.md)-cap weighting have been designed including:

#### Equal-Weighted Indexes

In these indexes, every stock carries the same weight, regardless of its [market](../m/market.md) cap. This reduces the concentration [risk](../r/risk.md), providing a more balanced representation of the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) components.

#### Price-Weighted Indexes

In price-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) indexes, the weight of each stock is determined by its share price. Examples of such indexes include the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA).

#### Fundamental-Weighted Indexes

These indexes weigh [stocks](../s/stock.md) based on fundamental metrics such as [earnings](../e/earnings.md), [revenue](../r/revenue.md), [book value](../b/book_value.md), and dividends. This approach aims to provide a [valuation](../v/valuation.md)-centered perspective instead of purely [market](../m/market.md)-driven weightings.

### Conclusion

[Market](../m/market.md)-cap [weighted](../w/weighted.md) indexes are essential in modern [finance](../f/finance.md) due to their widespread use and ease of implementation. They serve as significant benchmarks for the performance of the [stock market](../s/stock_market.md) and various investment funds. However, their structure inherently favors larger companies, posing certain risks such as over-concentration and reduced exposure to high-growth small-cap [stocks](../s/stock.md). Understanding both the merits and limitations of [market](../m/market.md)-cap [weighted](../w/weighted.md) indexes is crucial for investors and financial professionals when making well-informed investment decisions.

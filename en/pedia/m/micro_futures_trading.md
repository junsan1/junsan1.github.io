# Micro Futures Trading

Micro Futures Trading refers to the practice of trading in micro [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md), which are smaller versions of standard [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md). These contracts are typically 1/10 the size of a standard futures contract, allowing traders to access the futures markets with a smaller capital investment and reduced financial risk. This method of trading has democratized access to futures markets, enabling not just institutional investors but also retail traders to participate effectively.

## What Are Futures Contracts?

A futures contract is a legally binding agreement to buy or sell a particular commodity or financial instrument at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future. [Futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) are standardized to facilitate trading on futures exchanges and are used for hedging and speculative purposes. They cover a wide range of assets including commodities like oil, gold, and corn, financial instruments like Treasury bonds and stock indexes, and even currencies.

Micro [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) have emerged as a popular alternative due to their reduced financial commitment, lower margin requirements, and smaller contract sizes. They enable individual or small-scale traders to gain exposure to asset classes that were traditionally the domain of larger institutional investors.

## Types of Micro Futures

### Equity Index Micro Futures

Equity index micro futures are based on market indexes like the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the NASDAQ-100. For instance, the CME Group offers Micro E-mini futures on the S&P 500 (MES), NASDAQ-100 (MNQ), Dow Jones Industrial Average (MYM), and Russell 2000 (M2K). These contracts allow traders to hedge portfolio risks or speculate on the direction of equity markets with a smaller capital outlay.

### Commodity Micro Futures

Commodity micro futures cover physical goods like gold, crude oil, and agricultural products. CME and other exchanges offer these contracts to enable smaller traders to participate in commodities markets. For example, CME offers a Micro Gold Futures contract (MGC) which is 1/10 the size of a standard gold futures contract.

## Advantages of Micro Futures Trading

### Lower Financial Barrier

One of the main advantages of micro futures is the lower financial barrier to entry. Since micro [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) are a fraction of the size of standard contracts, the margin requirements are significantly lower. This allows retail traders to participate in markets that might otherwise be out of reach due to high capital requirements.

### Risk Management

Micro futures provide better [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) options. The smaller contract size means each tick movement has a smaller financial impact. This allows traders to fine-tune their [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) and manage risk more effectively than they could with standard [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md).

### Flexibility

Micro futures offer greater flexibility in trading. Traders can scale their positions more precisely and can enter and exit trades with more granularity. This is particularly beneficial for traders employing sophisticated [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) or those who need to adjust their positions frequently.

# Micro Futures Trading

Micro [Futures](../f/futures.md) Trading refers to the practice of trading in micro [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md), which are smaller versions of standard [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md). These contracts are typically 1/10 the size of a standard [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md), allowing traders to access the [futures](../f/futures.md) markets with a smaller [capital investment](../c/capital_investment.md) and reduced [financial risk](../f/financial_risk.md). This method of trading has democratized access to [futures](../f/futures.md) markets, enabling not just institutional investors but also retail traders to participate effectively.

## What Are Futures Contracts?

A [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) is a legally binding agreement to buy or sell a particular [commodity](../c/commodity.md) or [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future. [Futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) are standardized to facilitate trading on [futures](../f/futures.md) exchanges and are used for hedging and speculative purposes. They cover a wide [range](../r/range.md) of assets including commodities like oil, gold, and corn, financial instruments like Treasury bonds and stock indexes, and even currencies.

Micro [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) have emerged as a popular alternative due to their reduced financial commitment, lower [margin](../m/margin.md) requirements, and smaller contract sizes. They enable individual or small-scale traders to [gain](../g/gain.md) exposure to [asset](../a/asset.md) classes that were traditionally the domain of larger institutional investors.

## Types of Micro Futures

### Equity Index Micro Futures

[Equity](../e/equity.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md) micro [futures](../f/futures.md) are based on [market](../m/market.md) indexes like the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md)-100. For instance, the CME Group offers Micro [E-mini](../e/e-mini.md) [futures](../f/futures.md) on the S&P 500 (MES), [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md)-100 (MNQ), Dow Jones Industrial Average (MYM), and Russell 2000 (M2K). These contracts allow traders to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) portfolio risks or speculate on the direction of [equity](../e/equity.md) markets with a smaller [capital](../c/capital.md) outlay.

### Commodity Micro Futures

[Commodity](../c/commodity.md) micro [futures](../f/futures.md) cover physical goods like gold, [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md), and agricultural products. CME and other exchanges [offer](../o/offer.md) these contracts to enable smaller traders to participate in commodities markets. For example, CME offers a Micro Gold [Futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) (MGC) which is 1/10 the size of a standard gold [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md).

## Advantages of Micro Futures Trading

### Lower Financial Barrier

One of the main advantages of micro [futures](../f/futures.md) is the lower financial barrier to entry. Since micro [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) are a fraction of the size of standard contracts, the [margin](../m/margin.md) requirements are significantly lower. This allows retail traders to participate in markets that might otherwise be out of reach due to high [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements.

### Risk Management

Micro [futures](../f/futures.md) provide better [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) [options](../o/options.md). The smaller contract size means each [tick](../t/tick.md) movement has a smaller financial impact. This allows traders to fine-tune their [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) and manage [risk](../r/risk.md) more effectively than they could with standard [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md).

### Flexibility

Micro [futures](../f/futures.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) greater flexibility in trading. Traders can scale their positions more precisely and can enter and exit trades with more granularity. This is particularly beneficial for traders employing sophisticated [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) or those who need to adjust their positions frequently.

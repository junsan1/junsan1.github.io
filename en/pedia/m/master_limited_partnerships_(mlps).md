# Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs)

Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) are [business](../b/business.md) entities that combine the tax benefits of a partnership with the [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) of publicly traded securities. They are a type of publicly traded partnership (PTP) and are often found in the [energy sector](../e/energy_sector.md), particularly in industries like oil and gas. MLPs [trade](../t/trade.md) on major stock exchanges, making them accessible to a broad [range](../r/range.md) of investors.

## Structure of MLPs

MLPs consist of two main entities:

1. **[General Partner](../g/general_partner.md) (GP)**: The GP is responsible for the operation and management of the MLP. Typically, the GP holds a small percentage of ownership but has significant control over the MLPâ€™s operations. The GP may also be entitled to a portion of the cash distributions through incentive [distribution](../d/distribution.md) rights (IDRs).

2. **Limited Partners (LPs)**: LPs are the investors who provide the [capital](../c/capital.md) in [exchange](../e/exchange.md) for quarterly distributions. They have ownership [interest](../i/interest.md) in the MLP but typically do not participate in the day-to-day management of the partnership.

## Tax Advantages

One of the primary appeals of MLPs is their tax structure. Unlike corporations, MLPs are not subjected to entity-level [taxation](../t/taxation.md). Instead, the [income](../i/income.md) is only taxed when it is distributed to the partners, avoiding the [double taxation](../d/double_taxation.md) that affects many corporations. This "pass-through" tax structure can result in higher yields for investors.

### Deferred Taxes

Another beneficial aspect is the deferral of [taxes](../t/taxes.md). Distributions received by LPs are generally considered a [return](../r/return.md) of [capital](../c/capital.md), which means they are not taxed immediately but reduce the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s [cost basis](../c/cost_basis.md) in the partnership units. [Taxes](../t/taxes.md) are deferred until the units are sold or the [cost basis](../c/cost_basis.md) is reduced to zero.

## High Yield

MLPs are known for providing high yields. The businesses structured as MLPs, particularly in the [energy sector](../e/energy_sector.md), often generate stable and predictable cash flows through long-term contracts. This allows MLPs to distribute a significant portion of their [earnings](../e/earnings.md) to investors, leading to higher yields compared to other equities.

## Sector Concentration

A significant number of MLPs are concentrated in sectors like energy [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md). This includes pipelines, processing plants, storage facilities, and transportation networks. These assets are critical to the energy [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md) and often have stable, [fee](../f/fee.md)-based [revenue](../r/revenue.md) models.

### Energy Infrastructure

The energy [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) sector tends to be less sensitive to fluctuations in [commodity](../c/commodity.md) prices compared to [upstream](../u/upstream.md) exploration and production companies. This stability is appealing to investors seeking reliable [income](../i/income.md) streams.

### Geographic Diversification

Many MLPs have operations that span [multiple](../m/multiple.md) regions, providing geographic [diversification](../d/diversification.md) which can mitigate localized [market](../m/market.md) or regulatory risks.

## Risks of Investing in MLPs

### Regulatory Risks

Because a significant number of MLPs operate in the [energy sector](../e/energy_sector.md), they are subject to regulatory changes, which can affect their operations and profitability. Legislative changes to tax policies or environmental regulations can have a substantial impact on MLPs.

### Interest Rate Sensitivity

MLPs often have high [distribution](../d/distribution.md) yields, which can make them sensitive to [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) changes. Rising [interest](../i/interest.md) rates can make high-yielding assets like MLPs less attractive compared to other [income](../i/income.md)-generating investments.

### Commodity Price Exposure

While many MLPs operate in relatively stable [business](../b/business.md) lines, some can still be indirectly affected by changes in [commodity](../c/commodity.md) prices. A significant downturn in the energy [market](../m/market.md) can impact overall [industry](../i/industry.md) health, affecting MLP valuations.

## Prominent MLPs

Several large and notable MLPs exist, each with unique features and sectors of focus.

### Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (EPD)
Enterprise Products Partners L.P. is one of the largest MLPs in the United States. It operates a vast network of pipelines and is diversified across natural gas, NGLs ([natural gas liquids](../n/natural_gas_liquids.md)), [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md), and refined products. The company focuses on providing midstream energy services.

### Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. (MMP)
Magellan Midstream Partners is another significant player in the MLP space. It primarily operates refined [petroleum](../p/petroleum.md) products and [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md) pipelines. The company is known for its extensive pipeline systems that connect refineries to key markets.

### Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI)
Kinder Morgan operates one of the largest energy [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) networks in North America. While it is a [corporation](../c/corporation.md), it has historical ties and a structure similar to MLPs, holding significant assets in pipelines and terminals for transporting oil, gas, and other products.

## Performance Measurement

### Distributable Cash Flow (DCF)

One of the key metrics for evaluating MLP performance is Distributable [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md). DCF measures the cash generated by the MLP that is available to be distributed to investors. It is calculated by adjusting net [income](../i/income.md) for non-cash items such as [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) and amortization and for maintenance [capital](../c/capital.md) expenditures.

### Coverage Ratio

The [distribution](../d/distribution.md) [coverage ratio](../c/coverage_ratio.md) is also crucial. It compares DCF to the total distributions paid to LPs. A ratio above 1 indicates that the MLP is generating enough cash to cover its distributions, which is a sign of [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and sustainability.

## Investment Considerations

### Tax Reporting

[Investing](../i/investing.md) in MLPs requires dealing with K-1 tax forms. These forms are used to report the [income](../i/income.md), deductions, and credits from the partnership. K-1s can be more complex than the reporting required for standard equities, which can be a drawback for some investors.

### Retirement Accounts

Holding MLPs in [tax-advantaged](../t/tax-advantaged.md) accounts like IRAs can be complicated due to Unrelated [Business](../b/business.md) [Taxable Income](../t/taxable_income.md) (UBTI). If UBTI from all sources exceeds $1,000 in a year, it can result in tax [obligations](../o/obligation.md) even within the retirement account.

### Sector-Specific Dynamics

Investors should be familiar with the specific dynamics of the sector in which an MLP operates. Energy [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md), for example, has different [risk factors](../r/risk_factors_in_trading.md) and growth prospects compared to other industries.

## MLP ETFs and Funds

For investors looking to avoid the complexities of direct MLP investment, there are mutual funds and ETFs focused on MLPs. These funds [offer](../o/offer.md) diversified exposure to the MLP sector while simplifying the tax and administrative burdens for investors.

### Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP)

The Alerian MLP ETF is one of the largest and most well-known MLP ETFs. It seeks to track the performance of the Alerian MLP [Infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) and provides a diversified portfolio of midstream energy [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) MLPs.

## Conclusion

Master Limited Partnerships [offer](../o/offer.md) a unique investment opportunity, combining high yields with potential tax advantages. While they are predominantly found in the [energy sector](../e/energy_sector.md), MLPs [offer](../o/offer.md) [diversification](../d/diversification.md) within this space through various types of [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) assets. However, the complexities of tax reporting, sensitivity to regulatory changes, and sector-specific risks must be carefully considered. For those seeking simplified exposure, MLP-focused ETFs and mutual funds provide a viable alternative.

Understanding the intricate structure, benefits, and risks of MLPs is crucial for investors looking to add these assets to their portfolios.

# Money Order

A [money](../m/money.md) [order](../o/order.md) is a [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) that allows the specified payer to send a pre-determined amount of [money](../m/money.md) to a recipient through a reliable, paper-based [payment](../p/payment.md) method. [Money](../m/money.md) orders have been used for many years as a secure way to transfer funds, especially when electronic methods were not yet widely accessible. They are often favored over checks because they are prepaid at the point of purchase and, subsequently, less susceptible to bouncing or defaulting.

A [money](../m/money.md) [order](../o/order.md) is essentially a preloaded financial certificate that is guaranteed to be worth the amount printed on it. This makes it highly trusted and acceptable, especially in situations where immediate cash is less appropriate, or the payer is dealing with unknown parties.

## Origin and History

The concept of [money](../m/money.md) orders was first developed in the 19th century as a means of [offering](../o/offering.md) a safer alternative to mailing cash. The first known [money](../m/money.md) [order](../o/order.md) system was introduced in Great Britain by the London and National Provincial [Bank](../b/bank.md) in 1792. The concept quickly spread and was adopted by postal services and financial institutions around the world.

In the United States, the [money](../m/money.md) [order](../o/order.md) service was introduced by the Postal Service in 1864 as a response to public [demand](../d/demand.md) for a secure and reliable method of sending [money](../m/money.md). Over time, both private companies and financial institutions have developed their own [money](../m/money.md) [order](../o/order.md) services, making them widely available.

## How Money Orders Work

### Purchasing a Money Order

When someone needs to send [money](../m/money.md), they can purchase a [money](../m/money.md) [order](../o/order.md) at various locations, such as post offices, banks, [credit](../c/credit.md) unions, and retail locations like grocery stores and convenience stores. The purchaser typically pays upfront for the [face value](../f/face_value.md) of the [money](../m/money.md) [order](../o/order.md) plus a small [fee](../f/fee.md), which can vary based on where the [money](../m/money.md) [order](../o/order.md) is purchased.

The steps to purchase a [money](../m/money.md) [order](../o/order.md) usually involve:

1. **Choosing the Vendor**: Selecting a location that sells [money](../m/money.md) orders. Common vendors include the USPS, Western Union, MoneyGram, and various banks.
2. **[Payment](../p/payment.md)**: Paying for the [money](../m/money.md) [order](../o/order.md) using cash, a [debit](../d/debit.md) card, or sometimes a [credit card](../c/credit_card.md). The [sale](../s/sale.md) price includes the amount being sent plus a [fee](../f/fee.md) for the service.
3. **Completion**: Filling in the required information, such as the name of the recipient, the name of the purchaser, and sometimes a memo or reason for the [payment](../p/payment.md).
4. **Receiving the [Money](../m/money.md) [Order](../o/order.md)**: Obtaining a receipt for tracking and proof of purchase, which should be kept until the [money](../m/money.md) [order](../o/order.md) has been cashed and cleared.

### Cashing a Money Order

Once the [money](../m/money.md) [order](../o/order.md) is received by the intended recipient, they can cash it at a variety of locations, including banks, [credit](../c/credit.md) unions, or wherever [money](../m/money.md) orders are accepted. The process typically involves:

1. **Presenting the [Money](../m/money.md) [Order](../o/order.md)**: The recipient must take the [money](../m/money.md) [order](../o/order.md) to a place that cashes them. This might require visiting the original [issuer](../i/issuer.md), like the post office or a [bank](../b/bank.md).
2. **Identification**: Providing valid identification to verify the recipient's identity.
3. **[Endorsement](../e/endorsement.md)**: Signing the back of the [money](../m/money.md) [order](../o/order.md) to endorse it for cashing.
4. **Receiving Funds**: Collecting the funds in cash or having them deposited into a [bank](../b/bank.md) account.

# Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)

[Multiple Linear Regression](../m/multiple_linear_regression.md) (MLR) is a fundamental statistical technique that models the relationship between a dependent variable and [multiple](../m/multiple.md) independent variables. It is an extension of [simple linear regression](../s/simple_linear_regression.md), which involves only one independent variable. MLR provides a more realistic and comprehensive analysis of real-world phenomena, making it one of the most widely used and crucial tools in [finance](../f/finance.md), [econometrics](../e/econometrics_in_trading.md), and other fields where modeling and [forecasting](../f/forecasting.md) are essential.

## Theoretical Foundation

### Equation of Multiple Linear Regression
The general form of a [multiple linear regression](../m/multiple_linear_regression.md) model is:

\[ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + \cdots + \beta_pX_p + \varepsilon \]

Where:
- \( Y \) is the dependent variable.
- \( \beta_0 \) is the intercept.
- \( \beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_p \) are the coefficients of the independent variables.
- \( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_p \) are the independent variables.
- \( \varepsilon \) is the [error term](../e/error_term.md) (residuals).

### Assumptions of MLR
To ensure the validity of the MLR model, several key assumptions must be satisfied:
1. **Linearity**: The relationship between the dependent and independent variables is linear.
2. **Independence**: The residuals are independent across observations.
3. **Homoscedasticity**: The variance of the residuals is constant across all levels of the independent variables.
4. **Normality**: The residuals of the model should be normally distributed.
5. **No [multicollinearity](../m/multicollinearity.md)**: The independent variables should not be too highly linearly related to each other.

## Estimation of Coefficients

To estimate the coefficients (\( \[beta](../b/beta.md) \)) in the MLR model, the most common method is Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). This method minimizes the sum of squared residuals (the differences between observed and predicted values). Mathematically, OLS solves the following [optimization](../o/optimization.md) problem:

\[ \min_{\[beta](../b/beta.md)} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \mathbf{x}_i^\top \[beta](../b/beta.md) )^2 \]

Where:
- \( y_i \) is the observed [value](../v/value.md) of the dependent variable.
- \( \mathbf{x}_i \) is the vector of the independent variables for observation \( i \).
- \( \[beta](../b/beta.md) \) is the vector of coefficients.

## Interpretation of Coefficients

Each coefficient \( \beta_j \) in the MLR model measures the change in the dependent variable \( Y \) for a one-unit change in the independent variable \( X_j \), holding all other variables constant. The intercept \( \beta_0 \) represents the [expected value](../e/expected_value.md) of \( Y \) when all independent variables are zero.

## Model Evaluation

Evaluating the performance of an MLR model typically involves several metrics and tests:

### R-Squared and Adjusted R-Squared
- **[R-Squared](../r/r-squared_in_trading.md)**: Measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
\[ R^2 = 1 - \frac{SS_{res}}{SS_{tot}} \]
- **Adjusted [R-Squared](../r/r-squared_in_trading.md)**: Adjusts the [R-Squared](../r/r-squared_in_trading.md) for the number of predictors, providing a more accurate measure when [multiple](../m/multiple.md) predictors are in the model.
\[ \overline{R}^2 = 1 - \left( \frac{1 - R^2}{n - p - 1} \right) (n-1) \]

### F-Test
Used to determine the overall significance of the model. It tests the [null hypothesis](../n/null_hypothesis.md) that all regression coefficients are equal to zero.

### t-Test
Assesses the significance of individual regression coefficients, helping identify which predictors are meaningfully contributing to the model.

### Residual Analysis
Analyzing residuals helps diagnose violations of the MLR assumptions, such as non-linearity, heteroscedasticity, and independence.

## Applications in Finance

MLR is extensively used in [finance](../f/finance.md) for a variety of purposes:

### Asset Pricing Models
One of the most prominent applications is the [Capital Asset](../c/capital_asset.md) Pricing Model (CAPM), which can be extended to [multi-factor models](../m/multi-factor_models.md) like the Fama-French three-[factor](../f/factor.md) model. These models use MLR to explain stock returns based on several [risk factors](../r/risk_factors_in_trading.md).

### Risk Management
Financial institutions use MLR to model the [risk factors](../r/risk_factors_in_trading.md) affecting their portfolios. For instance, [credit risk models](../c/credit_risk_models.md) often use MLR to predict [default](../d/default.md) probabilities based on borrowers' characteristics.

### Forecasting and Time Series Analysis
MLR helps in [forecasting](../f/forecasting.md) [financial time series](../f/financial_time_series.md) data by modeling the relationship between a variable of [interest](../i/interest.md) (e.g., stock price) and several predictors (e.g., [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md)).

### Algorithmic Trading
In [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), MLR models can be used to develop [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) by identifying patterns and relationships among [multiple](../m/multiple.md) financial indicators. For example, a trading algorithm might use an MLR model to predict future price movements based on historical prices, volumes, and other [market](../m/market.md) signals.

## Implementing MLR in Python

Python is a powerful language for developing MLR models due to its rich ecosystem of libraries. Here's a brief guide to implementing MLR using popular Python libraries like numpy, pandas, and statsmodels.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Data Preparation**:
   [Load](../l/load.md) and preprocess data using pandas:
   ```python
   [import](../i/import.md) pandas as pd
   [import](../i/import.md) numpy as np

   # [Load](../l/load.md) data
   data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

   # Preprocess data ([handle](../h/handle.md) missing values, encode categorical variables, etc.)
   data.fillna(data.mean(), inplace=True)
   data = pd.get_dummies(data, drop_first=True)
   ```

2. **Define Independent and Dependent Variables**:
   ```python
   X = data.drop('dependent_variable', axis=1)  # Independent variables
   y = data['dependent_variable']  # Dependent variable
   ```

3. **Adding Constant**:
   It is often necessary to add a constant term to the independent variables:
   ```python
   [import](../i/import.md) statsmodels.api as sm

   X = sm.add_constant(X)
   ```

4. **Fit the Model**:
   Create and fit the MLR model using statsmodels:
   ```python
   model = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()
   ```

5. **Model Summary**:
   Retrieve and interpret the model summary:
   ```python
   print(model.summary())
   ```

6. **Prediction**:
   Make predictions using the fitted model:
   ```python
   predictions = model.predict(X)
   ```

### Example Application in Algorithmic Trading

In [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), let's consider an example where we predict the future price of a stock based on historical price, [volume](../v/volume.md), and a few [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicator.md).

```python
# Libraries
[import](../i/import.md) pandas as pd
[import](../i/import.md) numpy as np
[import](../i/import.md) statsmodels.api as sm

# Load historical stock data
data = pd.read_csv('historical_stock_data.csv')

# Create technical indicators (e.g., moving averages)
data['SMA_20'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()
data['SMA_50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
data['Volume_Change'] = data['[Volume](../v/volume.md)'].pct_change()

# Drop NaN values
data.dropna(inplace=True)

# Define the independent variables (excluding the date)
X = data[['SMA_20', 'SMA_50', 'Volume_Change']]
y = data['Close']

# Add a constant term
X = sm.add_constant(X)

# Fit the model
model = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()

# Print model summary
print(model.summary())

# Predict future prices
predictions = model.predict(X)

# Add predictions to the dataframe
data['Predicted_Close'] = predictions

# Save the predictions to a new CSV file
data.to_csv('predicted_stock_prices.csv', [index](../i/index_instrument.md)=False)
```

# Mercantilism

Mercantilism is an economic theory and practice that dominated Western Europe from the 16th to the late 18th century. It is a form of economic nationalism aimed at building a wealthy and powerful state. Governments and nations sought to accumulate monetary reserves through a positive balance of [trade](../t/trade.md), especially of finished goods. Mercantilism is based on the premise that global [wealth](../w/wealth.md) is static, and therefore, many European nations believed the best way to ensure their prosperity was through [trade](../t/trade.md) regulation and economic policies that enhance state power at the [expense](../e/expense.md) of rival national powers.

## Core Principles of Mercantilism

### Accumulation of Wealth
One of the defining principles of mercantilism is the belief that the amount of [wealth](../w/wealth.md) in the world is static, meaning that to prosper, a nation must accumulate [wealth](../w/wealth.md) at the [expense](../e/expense.md) of others. The [wealth](../w/wealth.md) of a nation during this period was measured by the amount of gold and silver it possessed. Mercantilists believed that a nation's strength came from building up its stock of gold and silver by exporting more than it imported.

### Trade Balance
Mercantilists advocated for a positive balance of [trade](../t/trade.md), meaning that they wanted to [export](../e/export.md) more than they imported. A [trade surplus](../t/trade_surplus.md) was believed to benefit the national [economy](../e/economy.md) since it meant an influx of [money](../m/money.md). This leads to the point that colonies were often seen as significant assets, as they provided [raw materials](../r/raw_materials.md) to the mother country and served as markets for its manufactured goods.

### Trade Regulation
Governments played a critical role in mercantilism by heavily regulating the [economy](../e/economy.md). This involved imposing tariffs on imports, granting monopolies, and providing subsidies to key industries. The goal was to ensure that the nation's industries were protected from foreign competition and that they could produce more goods for [export](../e/export.md).

### Colonization
Colonization was another cornerstone of mercantilist policy. European powers like Britain, France, and Spain acquired colonies primarily to benefit the mother country economically. Colonies functioned both as sources of [raw materials](../r/raw_materials.md) and as markets for the finished goods produced by the parent country. This relationship was institutionalized through various laws that restricted [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) in the colonies and required them to [trade](../t/trade.md) exclusively with the mother country.

## Historical Context

### Emergence
Mercantilism emerged in Europe as feudal economies began to decline and centralized nation-states started to become prominent. The rise of powerful kings who needed to [finance](../f/finance.md) their large armies and [bureaucracy](../b/bureaucracy.md) laid the groundwork for mercantilist policies. The voyages of discovery, particularly those of Christopher Columbus and Vasco da Gama, opened up new [trade](../t/trade.md) routes and made overseas riches accessible, further spurring mercantilist policies.

### Peak and Decline
Mercantilism reached its zenith in the 17th century but started to decline with the advent of new economic theories. The [industrial revolution](../i/industrial_revolution.md) brought about changes that mercantilism could not account for, such as the importance of industrial [capital](../c/capital.md) over precious metals. Additionally, the development of [classical economics](../c/classical_economics.md), particularly the work of Adam Smith, began to challenge the principles of mercantilism by advocating for [free trade](../f/free_trade.md) and competition.

## Mercantilism in Practice

### British Empire
The British Empire is often cited as a classic example of mercantilism in practice. England imposed several Navigation Acts, which restricted the use of foreign ships for [trade](../t/trade.md) between the mother country and its colonies. The colonies were required to ship their [raw materials](../r/raw_materials.md) to England and purchase manufactured goods exclusively from England, ensuring a favorable [trade](../t/trade.md) balance.

### France
In France, Jean-Baptiste Colbert implemented mercantilist policies under the rule of Louis XIV. Colbert aimed to make France self-sufficient by developing industries such as textiles and establishing state monopolies. He also focused on [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) improvements to support [commerce](../c/commerce.md), such as building roads and canals.

## Criticism and Legacy

### Criticism
1. **Inefficiency**: Mercantilism was criticized for its inefficiency and for creating monopolies and corruption. The focus on accumulating precious metals and protecting domestic industries often led to economic distortions.
2. **Colonial Exploitation**: The mercantilist policies led to the exploitation of colonies, which were often restricted from developing their own industries and were forced to [trade](../t/trade.md) exclusively with the mother country.
3. **Static [Wealth](../w/wealth.md) Fallacy**: The idea that global [wealth](../w/wealth.md) is static was increasingly disputed. Economic thought evolved to recognize that [wealth](../w/wealth.md) could be created through innovation and development, not just by accumulating precious metals.

### Legacy
Despite its decline, mercantilism left a lasting impact. It laid the foundations for modern economic policies, particularly those involving [trade](../t/trade.md) and national industries. Some elements of mercantilism are still evident today in the form of protectionist [trade](../t/trade.md) policies and economic nationalism. For instance, countries imposing tariffs to protect domestic industries from foreign competition can be seen as a modern reflection of mercantilist thought.

## Notable Figures in Mercantilism

### Jean-Baptiste Colbert
Jean-Baptiste Colbert was a French statesman who served as the Minister of Finances of France from 1665 to 1683 under the rule of King Louis XIV. Colbert’s policies aimed at bringing about economic self-sufficiency for France. He developed [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md), implemented strict regulations on goods, and improved [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) to facilitate [trade](../t/trade.md).

### Thomas Mun
Thomas Mun was an English [economist](../e/economist.md) and a key figure in the development of mercantilism. His work "England’s Treasure by Forraign [Trade](../t/trade.md)" argued that the best way for England to increase its [wealth](../w/wealth.md) was through a favorable balance of [trade](../t/trade.md), specifically by exporting more goods than it imported.

## Conclusion

Mercantilism played a crucial role in shaping the economic policies of European nations from the 16th to the 18th century. While it had its drawbacks and was eventually supplanted by classical economic theories advocating [free trade](../f/free_trade.md), its impact on history is undeniable. Mercantilism helped to lay the groundwork for the modern economic policies and the development of nation-states, influencing how countries thought about [wealth](../w/wealth.md), [trade](../t/trade.md), and economic policy for centuries to come.

# Market Scanners and Screeners

**[Market scanners](../m/market_scanners.md)** and **screeners** are fundamental tools utilized in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) to identify trading opportunities based on predefined criteria. They automate the process of searching through thousands of [stocks](../s/stock.md), ETFs, mutual funds, [futures](../f/futures.md), forex, or other financial instruments to find those that exhibit desirable characteristics for [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

## Key Concepts of Market Scanners and Screeners

1. **[Market](../m/market.md) Scanner**: A [market](../m/market.md) scanner continuously monitors [multiple](../m/multiple.md) markets and assets in real-time to identify opportunities as soon as they arise. The scanner often operates on a [tick](../t/tick.md)-by-[tick](../t/tick.md) [basis](../b/basis.md) or at set intervals to update traders with the latest actionable data.

2. **Screener**: A screener is used to filter through a large database of [stocks](../s/stock.md) or other financial instruments based on specific criteria set by the user. These criteria can include [financial ratios](../f/financial_ratios.md), [price patterns](../p/price_patterns.md), [volume](../v/volume.md) data, [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md), or fundamental metrics. Unlike scanners, screeners are usually run manually at specified times rather than continuously.

## Types of Market Scanners and Screeners

1. **Technical Scanners**:
   - Utilize various [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) such as moving averages, MACD, RSI, [Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md), etc., to identify patterns and signals.
   - Often applied in [day trading](../d/day_trading.md) to capture short-term price movements.

2. **Fundamental Screeners**:
   - Based on [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md) criteria like P/E ratio, EPS growth, [revenue](../r/revenue.md) growth, [dividend yield](../d/dividend_yield.md), and other [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) indicators.
   - Commonly used in [value investing](../v/value_investing.md) or long-term investment strategies.

3. **Hybrid Scanners and Screeners**:
   - Combine both technical and fundamental criteria to provide a more comprehensive analysis.
   - Useful for strategies that need a blend of short-term price actions and long-term company performance.

## Core Components of Scanners and Screeners

1. **Criteria Specification**:
    - Users define the set of rules or metrics that the scanner or screener [will](../w/will.md) use to filter or identify trading opportunities.

2. **Data Feed**:
    - High-quality and real-time data feeds are essential for the effectiveness of scanners and screeners, including historical data for [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md).

3. **Processing Engine**:
    - The processing engine applies the defined criteria to the incoming data to generate signals or alerts. It needs to be fast and efficient to [handle](../h/handle.md) large datasets.

4. **User Interface**:
    - A user-friendly interface allows traders to easily set criteria, view results, and manage signals or alerts.

# Mortgage-Backed Security (MBS)

A [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-Backed [Security](../s/security.md) (MBS) is a type of investment that is secured by a collection of mortgages. An MBS is a way for a [bank](../b/bank.md) to have more [money](../m/money.md) available to lend to homebuyers: it sells the loans it has already made to investors, potentially at a [discount](../d/discount.md) to their [face value](../f/face_value.md), bundled together in what's typically referred to as a "[security](../s/security.md)."

## Overview

[Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-Backed Securities allow investors to [profit](../p/profit.md) from the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [market](../m/market.md) without having to actually make or service [home](../h/home.md) loans. They [offer](../o/offer.md) relatively high returns compared to other types of bonds, but they also entail [risk](../r/risk.md) because they are linked to potentially defaulting [home](../h/home.md) mortgages.

## History and Evolution

### Pre-2008

MBS emerged in the 1970s as a way for banks to move mortgages off their balance sheets and free up [capital](../c/capital.md) to [issue](../i/issue.md) more loans. Government-Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) like Fannie Mae, [Freddie Mac](../f/freddie_mac.md), and Ginnie Mae played significant roles in fostering the growth of the MBS [market](../m/market.md).

### The 2008 Financial Crisis

The 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) highlighted the risks associated with MBSâ€”particularly those tied to subprime mortgages, which were loans given to borrowers with poor [credit](../c/credit.md) histories. When homeowners began to [default](../d/default.md) on these subprime loans, the [value](../v/value.md) of MBS containing those loans plummeted, leading to massive losses for financial institutions and investors. The fallout resulted in rigorous regulatory changes aimed at increasing the [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and stability of the MBS [market](../m/market.md). 

## Types of MBS

There are several types of MBS, depending on the loans backing them and their structure:

1. **Pass-Through Securities**: These securities pass the [principal](../p/principal.md) and [interest](../i/interest.md) payments from the pool of mortgages through to investors. Each [investor](../i/investor.md) receives a proportionate share of the [interest](../i/interest.md) and [principal](../p/principal.md) payments made by the borrowers.

2. **Collateralized [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [Obligations](../o/obligation.md) (CMOs)**: CMOs are more complex MBS that divide the pool of mortgages into different "[tranches](../t/tranches.md)" (slices) based on [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md). Each tranche is structured to cater to various [risk](../r/risk.md) appetites and investment time horizons.

3. **Stripped MBS**: These are derived from standard MBS and are split into [Interest](../i/interest.md)-Only (IO) and [Principal](../p/principal.md)-Only (PO) components. Investors can choose to invest in the [interest](../i/interest.md) part or the [principal](../p/principal.md) part of the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) payments.

4. **Hybrid MBS**: These combine elements of both pass-throughs and CMOs.

## How MBS Work

The creation of an MBS begins at the [bank](../b/bank.md), where [home](../h/home.md) loans are bundled together. These assets are then sold to a special purpose vehicle (SPV) or [trust](../t/trust.md), which repackages them into securities for [sale](../s/sale.md) to investors. Payments made by homeowners on these [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) loans flow through to the investors, providing them with regular [income](../i/income.md). The [bank](../b/bank.md) that originated the [loan](../l/loan.md) often continues to service the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md), collecting payments from homeowners and remitting them to the SPV or [trust](../t/trust.md).

## Risks and Benefits

### Risks

- **[Credit Risk](../c/credit_risk.md)**: The [risk](../r/risk.md) that homeowners [will](../w/will.md) [default](../d/default.md) on their loans.
- **[Prepayment Risk](../p/prepayment_risk.md)**: The [risk](../r/risk.md) that homeowners [will](../w/will.md) repay their loans ahead of schedule, thus ending the [income](../i/income.md) stream.
- **[Interest Rate Risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md)**: The [risk](../r/risk.md) that fluctuating [interest](../i/interest.md) rates [will](../w/will.md) affect the [value](../v/value.md) of the MBS.

### Benefits

- **High Returns**: MBS often [offer](../o/offer.md) higher returns than other types of bonds.
- **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: Investors can diversify their portfolios by adding exposure to the [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) [market](../m/market.md).
- **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)**: Many MBS are [listed](../l/listed.md) on exchanges or traded over-the-counter, making them relatively [liquid](../l/liquid.md).

## Regulation and Oversight

Post-2008, the regulation surrounding MBS became significantly more stringent. The [Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act](../d/dodd-frank_wall_street_reform_and_consumer_protection_act.md) implemented measures to enforce stricter [underwriting standards](../u/underwriting_standards.md) and enhance [transparency](../t/transparency.md) in the MBS [market](../m/market.md). Agencies like the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) and the Federal Housing [Finance](../f/finance.md) Agency (FHFA) also play vital roles in regulating the [market](../m/market.md).

## Prominent Players

### Government-Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs)

- **Fannie Mae**: Fannie Mae works to ensure that [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) loans are available to low- and moderate-[income](../i/income.md) homebuyers by buying loans from lenders.

- **[Freddie Mac](../f/freddie_mac.md)**: Similar to Fannie Mae, [Freddie Mac](../f/freddie_mac.md) purchases loans from lenders to provide [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), stability, and affordability to the housing [market](../m/market.md).

- **Ginnie Mae**: Ginnie Mae primarily focuses on providing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and backing for federally insured loans such as those backed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA).

## Investment Strategies

### Long-Only Strategy

Investors adopting a long-only strategy in MBS aim to [hold](../h/hold.md) securities that they believe [will](../w/will.md) perform well, often seeking high-quality mortgages with low [default risk](../d/default_risk.md).

### Hedging

Investors may use hedging techniques to mitigate risks associated with their MBS [holdings](../h/holdings.md). This could involve [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) such as [credit default swaps](../c/credit_default_swaps.md) (CDS) or [interest rate swaps](../i/interest_rate_swaps.md) to protect against adverse movements in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates or defaults.

### Active Management

[Active management](../a/active_management.md) involves continuously monitoring and adjusting the MBS portfolio to take advantage of [market](../m/market.md) conditions. This strategy often requires sophisticated [risk management techniques](../r/risk_management_techniques.md) and analytics.

### Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) in the MBS [market](../m/market.md) uses statistical models to identify trading opportunities. These algorithms can help investors execute trades quickly and efficiently, often capitalizing on small price discrepancies that may exist due to [market](../m/market.md) inefficiencies.

## Conclusion

[Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-Backed Securities remain a popular and sophisticated type of investment, [offering](../o/offering.md) both risks and rewards. Their intricate structure and the regulatory framework surrounding them make MBS a subject of continued importance and relevance in the financial world. Understanding the basics of how MBS work, the types available, and the associated risks and benefits can help investors make informed decisions in this complex [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md).

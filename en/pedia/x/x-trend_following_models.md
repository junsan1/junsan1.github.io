# X-Trend Following Models

[Trend following](../t/trend_following.md) is a trading strategy that endeavors to profit from market momentum by identifying and riding along with trends, whether they are upwards or downwards. This strategy is rooted in [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) and relies heavily on utilizing market indicators and historical price data to make trading decisions. Among the multiplicity of methodologies that fall under [trend following](../t/trend_following.md), several noteworthy models and approaches stand out. These models vary in complexity, from simple moving averages (SMAs) to more sophisticated algorithms like the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and beyond. This document will delve into some of the most significant trend-following models employed in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md).

## Moving Averages (MA)

Moving Averages are one of the most rudimentary and effective tools for identifying trends. They smooth out price action by filtering out the noise from random price fluctuations and generating a single flowing line that represents the average price over a certain period.

### Simple Moving Average (SMA)
A Simple Moving Average calculates the average of a selected range of prices. For instance, a 50-day SMA takes the closing prices of the last 50 days, sums them up, and divides by 50. The SMA is easy to calculate and helps to identify market trends over various time frames.

- **Calculation**: 
  \[
  SMA = \frac{P_1 + P_2 + ... + P_n}{n}
  \]
  Where \( P \) is the price at each period, and \( n \) is the number of periods.
  
### Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
Unlike the SMA, the Exponential Moving Average places more weight on recent prices, making it more responsive to new information. This characteristic makes the EMA preferable for [short-term trading](../s/short-term_trading.md) strategies.

- **Calculation**:
  \[
  EMA_t = P_t \times \left( \frac{2}{n+1} \right) + EMA_{t-1} \times \left( 1 - \frac{2}{n+1} \right)
  \]
  Where \( EMA_t \) is the current EMA, \( P_t \) is the current price, \( n \) is the number of periods, and \( EMA_{t-1} \) is the EMA of the previous period.

## Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)

The MACD is a momentum oscillator that follows the trends and shows the relationship between two moving averages of a securityâ€™s price. It is composed mainly of:

- **MACD Line**: The difference between the 26-day EMA and the 12-day EMA.
- **Signal Line**: A 9-day EMA of the MACD Line.
- **Histogram**: The difference between the MACD Line and the Signal Line.

### Interpretation
- **MACD Crossover**: When the MACD Line crosses above the Signal Line, it indicates a bullish signal (time to buy), and when it crosses below, it indicates a bearish signal (time to sell).
- **Histogram**: The height of the histogram bars represents the strength of the trend.

## Relative Strength Index (RSI)

Though primarily used as a momentum oscillator, the RSI can also be employed as a trend-following indicator. It measures the speed and change of price movements on a scale from 0 to 100.

### Formula
\[
RSI = 100 - \left(\frac{100}{1 + RS}\right)
\]
Where \( RS \) is the relative strength, calculated as the average gain divided by the average loss over a given period.

### Application
- **Above 70**: The market might be overbought, indicating a possible downtrend.
- **Below 30**: The market might be oversold, indicating a possible uptrend.
  
## Bollinger Bands

Created by John Bollinger, [Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md) consist of a middle band being an n-period moving average, an upper band with k times n-period standard deviation above the average, and a lower band with k times the n-period standard deviation below the average.

### Components
- **Middle Band**: 20-day SMA
- **Upper Band**: 20-day SMA + (2 x 20-day standard deviation)
- **Lower Band**: 20-day SMA - (2 x 20-day standard deviation)

### Usage
- **Squeeze**: Indicates a period of low volatility, could signal future breakout opportunities.
- **Breakouts**: Prices moving outside the bands can signify the start of a trend.

## Parabolic SAR (Stop and Reverse)

The [Parabolic SAR](../p/parabolic_sar.md) is a time/price trading system created by J. Welles Wilder. It is used to determine the direction of trends and potential reversals in price movements.

### Interpretation
- **Bullish Signal**: When the dot switches from above the price to below the price.
- **Bearish Signal**: When the dot switches from below the price to above the price.

## Donchian Channels

Developed by Richard Donchian, the Donchian Channel uses the highest high and the lowest low over a particular period to generate signals. It is often used in [breakout trading](../b/breakout_trading.md) strategies.

### Components
- **Upper Band**: Highest high over N periods.
- **Lower Band**: Lowest low over N periods.
  
### Strategy
- **Buy Signal**: When the price breaks above the upper band.
- **Sell Signal**: When the price falls below the lower band.

## Ichimoku Cloud

The [Ichimoku Cloud](../i/ichimoku_cloud.md), or Ichimoku Kinko Hyo, provides more data points than the standard candlestick chart. It combines multiple indicators that provide support/resistance levels, trend direction, and momentum.

### Components
- **Tenkan-sen**: (9-period high + 9-period low) / 2
- **Kijun-sen**: (26-period high + 26-period low) / 2
- **Senkou Span A**: (Tenkan-sen + Kijun-sen) / 2
- **Senkou Span B**: (52-period high + 52-period low) / 2
- **Chikou Span**: Current close plotted 26 periods back.

### Interpretation
- **Cloud Color**: The gap between Senkou Span A and Senkou Span B plotted 26 periods ahead forms the Cloud. The color of the Cloud indicates the trend.
- **Price Position**: Price above the Cloud signals an uptrend, while below the Cloud signals a downtrend.

# X-Technical Indicators

Technical indicators are mathematical calculations based on the price, volume, or open interest of a security or contract. They are a fundamental aspect of technical analysis and are used by traders to predict future price movements. Here, we will delve into a variety of technical indicators, exploring both their theoretical underpinnings and practical applications.

## Moving Averages

### Simple Moving Average (SMA)
The Simple Moving Average (SMA) is the arithmetic mean of a given set of prices over a specific number of days in the past. It is calculated by summing the closing prices of a security for a period and then dividing this total by the number of periods. For example, a 30-day SMA sums the closing prices for the last 30 days and then divides the result by 30.

### Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
The Exponential Moving Average (EMA) gives more weight to recent prices to make it more responsive to new information. The EMA is calculated using the following formula:

```
EMA = (Price_today * K) + (EMA_yesterday * (1 - K))
```

Where:
- `K` is the smoothing constant calculated as `2 / (N + 1)`.
- `N` is the number of days in EMA.

## Momentum Indicators

### Relative Strength Index (RSI)
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) measures the speed and change of price movements. The RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Traditionally, RSI readings of 70 or above indicate that a security is becoming overbought, while readings of 30 or below indicate that it is oversold.

### Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
The MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a securityâ€™s price. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period EMA from the 12-period EMA. A nine-period EMA of the MACD known as the "signal line" is then plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy and sell signals.

## Oscillators

### Stochastic Oscillator
The Stochastic Oscillator compares a particular closing price of a security to a range of its prices over a certain period. The oscillator ranges from 0 to 100 and is used to identify overbought and oversold conditions. It is calculated using the formula:

```
%K = (Current Close - Lowest Low) / (Highest High - Lowest Low) * 100
```

The `%D` line is a 3-day simple moving average of `%K`.

### Commodity Channel Index (CCI)
The Commodity Channel Index (CCI) measures the variation of a security's price from its average price. High positive readings suggest that prices are unusually high compared to their average, whereas low negative readings indicate that prices are unusually low. CCI is calculated with:

```
CCI = (Typical Price - Moving Average of Typical Price) / (0.015 * Mean Deviation)
```

Where `Typical Price = (High + Low + Close) / 3`.

## Volume-Based Indicators

### On-Balance Volume (OBV)
On-Balance Volume (OBV) measures buying and selling pressure as a cumulative indicator that adds volume on up days and subtracts volume on down days. It is a running total of volume that shows if volume is flowing in or out of a security.

### Chaikin Money Flow (CMF)
The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) is used to measure the accumulation-distribution line over a specific period. It uses both price and volume to measure buying and selling pressure.

```
CMF = {Sum of [Volume * ((Close - Low) - (High - Close)) / (High - Low)]} / Sum of Volume
```

## Volatility Indicators

### Bollinger Bands
Bollinger Bands consist of a middle band being a simple moving average, and an upper and lower band at standard deviations above and below the SMA. The formula for Bollinger Bands is:

```
Upper Band = SMA + (Standard Deviation * N)
Lower Band = SMA - (Standard Deviation * N)
```

Where `N` is the number of days in the calculation, the default being 20.

### Average True Range (ATR)
The Average True Range (ATR) is an indicator that measures market volatility. It is typically derived from the 14-day simple moving average of a series of true range indicators.

```
True Range (TR) = Maximum[(High - Low), (High - Close_previous), (Low - Close_previous)]
```

ATR is the moving average of TR over a specified period.

## Trend Indicators

### Parabolic SAR
The Parabolic SAR is a trend-following indicator that helps identify potential reversal points in the price direction of a security. It is represented on the chart by a series of dots placed either above or below the price bars (depending on the trend direction).

The SAR is calculated as follows:
- If in an uptrend, SAR_n+1 = SAR_n + AF * (EP - SAR_n)
- If in a downtrend, SAR_n+1 = SAR_n - AF * (SAR_n - EP)

Where:
- `AF` is the acceleration factor (default is 0.02).
- `EP` is the highest high in an uptrend and the lowest low in a downtrend.

### Ichimoku Cloud
The Ichimoku Cloud is a collection of technical indicators that shows support and resistance levels, momentum, and trend direction. It provides more data points than the standard candlestick charts by generating five different lines:

- Tenkan-sen (Conversion Line): (Highest High + Lowest Low) / 2 over the last 9 periods.
- Kijun-sen (Base Line): (Highest High + Lowest Low) / 2 over the last 26 periods.
- Senkou Span A (Leading Span A): (Tenkan-sen + Kijun-sen) / 2, plotted 26 periods ahead.
- Senkou Span B (Leading Span B): (Highest High + Lowest Low) / 2 over the last 52 periods, plotted 26 periods ahead.
- Chikou Span (Lagging Span): Closing price plotted 26 periods back.

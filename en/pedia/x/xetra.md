# Xetra

Xetra, an abbreviation for "[Exchange](../e/exchange.md) Electronic Trading," is a [trading platform](../t/trading_platform.md) that was launched in 1997 by [Deutsche Börse](../d/deutsche_börse.md), the organization that operates the Frankfurt Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse, or FWB). Xetra revolutionized the [equity trading](../e/equity_trading.md) landscape in Germany by automating stock trading activities and making the process more efficient, transparent, and cost-effective. 

As one of the world's most advanced [trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md), Xetra handles a substantial [volume](../v/volume.md) of European [equity trading](../e/equity_trading.md). It has expanded over the years to include indexes, mutual funds, bonds, and various other financial instruments. This document [will](../w/will.md) delve into various aspects of Xetra, exploring its history, functionalities, advantages, and its impact on global trading.

## History and Background

Before the advent of Xetra, the [trading environment](../t/trading_environment.md) was predominantly manual, involving floor trading and telephone orders. This setup was not only labor-intensive but also prone to human errors. As technology progressed, there was a clear need for an automated system that could [handle](../h/handle.md) large volumes of transactions quickly and efficiently.

[Deutsche Börse](../d/deutsche_börse.md) initiated the development of Xetra in the mid-1990s, envisioning a platform that could integrate seamlessly into Europe's growing stock markets. Launched in November 1997, Xetra quickly became the backbone of [equity trading](../e/equity_trading.md) in Germany and other parts of Europe.

## Technical Architecture

Xetra's technical architecture is designed for high performance and reliability. The backbone of the system runs on high-performance computing and adheres to the latest regulatory and cybersecurity standards. Below are some key components:

### Front End

Xetra offers a user-friendly interface for traders, brokers, and institutional investors. Through secure login credentials, users can access real-time data feeds, execute trades, and manage their portfolios.

### Matching Engine

The matching engine is the core component of Xetra, facilitating the actual buying and selling of securities. It uses algorithms to match buy and sell orders based on price and time priority, ensuring a fair and efficient trading process.

### Market Data Dissemination

Xetra provides [real-time market data](../r/real-time_market_data.md) to its users, including detailed information about [bid](../b/bid.md)/ask prices, [trade](../t/trade.md) volumes, and historical data. This allows traders to make informed decisions quickly.

### Risk Management and Compliance

To safeguard [market](../m/market.md) integrity, Xetra incorporates advanced [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) features. It employs pre-[trade](../t/trade.md), at-[trade](../t/trade.md), and post-[trade](../t/trade.md) [risk](../r/risk.md) checks to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.

## Trading Features

### Order Types

Xetra supports a variety of [order types](../o/order_types_in_trading.md) to meet the diverse needs of traders:

- **[Market](../m/market.md) Orders:** Execute immediately at current [market](../m/market.md) prices.
- **Limit Orders:** Execute only at a specified price or better.
- **Stop Orders:** Trigger when a specified [price level](../p/price_level.md) is reached.
- **Iceberg Orders:** Large orders broken into smaller chunks to minimize [market](../m/market.md) impact.

### Trading Phases

Xetra operates through different trading phases:

- **Pre-Trading:**
  The [market](../m/market.md) is [open](../o/open.md) for [order](../o/order.md) entry and modification but no actual trading occurs.
- **Continuous Trading:**
  Orders are matched in real-time based on price-time priority.
- **Closing Auction:**
  Determines end-of-day prices based on [supply](../s/supply.md) and [demand](../d/demand.md).

### Market Making

[Market](../m/market.md) makers play a crucial role in Xetra by providing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and narrowing [bid](../b/bid.md)-ask [spreads](../s/spreads.md). They are obligated to [quote](../q/quote.md) both buy and sell prices, ensuring that there is always a [counterparty](../c/counterparty.md) for a [trade](../t/trade.md).

## Advantages

### Efficiency and Speed

With a technical capacity to process thousands of transactions per second, Xetra ensures that trades are executed quickly, reducing the time and cost associated with manual trading.

### Transparency

By providing real-time data and a clear view of [market depth](../m/market_depth.md), Xetra enhances [market](../m/market.md) [transparency](../t/transparency.md). Traders have access to all the information they need to make informed decisions.

### Accessibility

Xetra can be accessed easily from anywhere in the world, allowing international investors to participate in European [equity](../e/equity.md) markets seamlessly.

### Cost-Effectiveness

The automated nature of Xetra minimizes the necessity for intermediaries, thereby reducing [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md). 

### Robust Risk Management

With sophisticated [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) tools, Xetra ensures a secure [trading environment](../t/trading_environment.md) that complies with international regulatory standards.

## Global Impact

Since its launch, Xetra has gained recognition as one of the leading electronic trading platforms in the world. Its adoption has not only increased [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) in European markets but also set new standards for trading technology globally. Xetra has formed partnerships with various other exchanges to extend its reach, including the Vienna Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) and the Irish Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md).

## Conclusion

Xetra has fundamentally transformed the trading landscape with its advanced technology, efficient processes, and [robust](../r/robust.md) [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) features. By [offering](../o/offering.md) an automated, transparent, and cost-effective [trading environment](../t/trading_environment.md), it has become a cornerstone in the world of electronic trading.

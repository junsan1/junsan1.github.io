# Xetra

Xetra, an abbreviation for "Exchange Electronic Trading," is a trading platform that was launched in 1997 by Deutsche Börse, the organization that operates the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse, or FWB). Xetra revolutionized the equity trading landscape in Germany by automating stock trading activities and making the process more efficient, transparent, and cost-effective. 

As one of the world's most advanced trading systems, Xetra handles a substantial volume of European equity trading. It has expanded over the years to include indexes, mutual funds, bonds, and various other financial instruments. This document will delve into various aspects of Xetra, exploring its history, functionalities, advantages, and its impact on global trading.

## History and Background

Before the advent of Xetra, the trading environment was predominantly manual, involving floor trading and telephone orders. This setup was not only labor-intensive but also prone to human errors. As technology progressed, there was a clear need for an automated system that could handle large volumes of transactions quickly and efficiently.

Deutsche Börse initiated the development of Xetra in the mid-1990s, envisioning a platform that could integrate seamlessly into Europe's growing stock markets. Launched in November 1997, Xetra quickly became the backbone of equity trading in Germany and other parts of Europe.

## Technical Architecture

Xetra's technical architecture is designed for high performance and reliability. The backbone of the system runs on high-performance computing and adheres to the latest regulatory and cybersecurity standards. Below are some key components:

### Front End

Xetra offers a user-friendly interface for traders, brokers, and institutional investors. Through secure login credentials, users can access real-time data feeds, execute trades, and manage their portfolios.

### Matching Engine

The matching engine is the core component of Xetra, facilitating the actual buying and selling of securities. It uses algorithms to match buy and sell orders based on price and time priority, ensuring a fair and efficient trading process.

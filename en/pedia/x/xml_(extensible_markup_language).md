# XML (Extensible Markup Language)

XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a flexible, versatile text-based format commonly used for storing and transporting data across different systems in a structured, consistent manner. Originally designed to meet the challenges of electronic publishing, XML quickly gained widespread adoption far beyond its original domain due to its simplicity, extensibility, and ability to provide a framework for creating custom markup languages.

## Origins and Purpose

XML was developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and was first introduced in 1998 as a subset of the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML). The primary objective of XML is to facilitate data sharing across different information systems, particularly via the Internet, while maintaining a high level of human readability.

## Key Features

### Extensibility

One of the hallmark features of XML is its extensibility. Unlike HTML, which has a fixed set of tags, XML allows users to define their own custom tags. This makes it particularly useful for representing a wide array of data structures and domains.

### Self-Descriptive

XML documents are self-descriptive; they include both the data and the rules for its structure and layout. Tags and attributes are used to describe the data, making it possible for humans and machines alike to understand the information without requiring additional metadata or schemas.

### Platform and Language Independent

XML is both platform and language agnostic, making it highly versatile for data interchange between systems built on different technologies. It can be efficiently parsed and processed by numerous programming languages, including Java, C#, Python, and JavaScript, among others.

### Hierarchical Structure

XML inherently supports a hierarchical data structure, making it suitable for representing nested data. This hierarchical approach aligns well with many real-world data models, making XML useful for complex data representations.

### Interoperability

Because of its widespread acceptance and standardization, XML serves as a lingua franca for data interchange, allowing systems with differing [underlying](../u/underlying.md) architectures to communicate more seamlessly.

## Technical Aspects

### Syntax

An XML document consists of elements and attributes structured in a tree-like manner. Here’s a simple example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<[note](../n/note.md)>
    <to>Tove</to>
    <from>Jani</from>
    <heading>Reminder</heading>
    <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
</[note](../n/note.md)>
```

In this example, the `<[note](../n/note.md)>` element contains four child elements: `<to>`, `<from>`, `<heading>`, and `<body>`. Each element can also have attributes:

```xml
<[note](../n/note.md) priority="high">
    <to>Tove</to>
    <from>Jani</from>
    <heading>Reminder</heading>
    <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
</[note](../n/note.md)>
```

### Namespaces

Namespaces in XML help avoid naming conflicts by qualifying element and attribute names. Namespaces are declared using the `xmlns` attribute:

```xml
<bookstore xmlns:bk="http://www.example.com/books">
    <bk:book>
        <bk:title>XML Developer's Guide</bk:title>
        <bk:author>John Doe</bk:author>
    </bk:book>
</bookstore>
```

### Schema Definitions

While XML itself does not prescribe data structure rules, its capability can be significantly extended using XML Schema (XSD), Document Type Definition (DTD), or RELAX NG. These schemas define the structure, content, and semantics of XML documents, enabling validation.

#### Example of an XML Schema:

```xml
<xs:schema xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
    <xs:element name="[note](../n/note.md)">
        <xs:complexType>
            <xs:sequence>
                <xs:element name="to" type="xs:string"/>
                <xs:element name="from" type="xs:string"/>
                <xs:element name="heading" type="xs:string"/>
                <xs:element name="body" type="xs:string"/>
            </xs:sequence>
        </xs:complexType>
    </xs:element>
</xs:schema>
```

### Parsing

To read XML data, programming languages [offer](../o/offer.md) various parsers. Common types of parsers include:

#### DOM (Document Object Model) Parser

DOM parsers read the entire XML document and convert it into a tree structure stored in memory. This allows for easier navigation and manipulation of the document but can be resource-intensive for large files.

#### SAX (Simple API for XML) Parser

SAX parsers are event-driven and read XML documents sequentially. They are generally faster and use less memory than DOM parsers but do not allow for easy backward navigation.

#### StAX (Streaming API for XML) Parser

StAX combines the best of both SAX and DOM parsers by [offering](../o/offering.md) a cursor-based, event-driven approach but also allowing for easier data retrieval and manipulation.

## Applications in Various Domains

### Web Development

XML plays a crucial role in web development, particularly for configuring web services and APIs. RESTful services often utilize JSON, but XML remains prevalent in SOAP-based web services.

### Configuration Files

Many software applications use XML for configuration files (e.g., Maven’s `pom.xml`, Spring’s `applicationContext.xml`). These configuration files are more human-readable and easier to maintain compared to other formats.

### Data Interchange

Industries such as [finance](../f/finance.md), healthcare, and [logistics](../l/logistics.md) use XML to interchange complex data structures between [business](../b/business.md) systems. For example, Financial products Markup Language (FpML) is widely used in the trading and fintech space for over-the-counter (OTC) transactions.

### Document Management Systems

XML forms the backbone of many document management systems by defining the structure and metadata of documents. Standards such as OpenDocument Format (ODF) and Office [Open](../o/open.md) XML (OOXML) are based on XML.

### API Integration

APIs often use XML to transmit structured data between clients and servers. This is especially true for legacy systems where XML has been standardized.

### E-commerce

In the realm of e-[commerce](../c/commerce.md), XML is extensively used for defining product catalogs, [customer](../c/customer.md) data, and [order](../o/order.md) processing. This standardization helps in integrating different e-[commerce](../c/commerce.md) platforms and suppliers.

## Pros and Cons

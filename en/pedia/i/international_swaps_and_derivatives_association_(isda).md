# International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA)

The International Swaps and [Derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) Association (ISDA) is a [trade](../t/trade.md) organization of participants in the [market](../m/market.md) for over-the-counter (OTC) [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md). Founded in 1985, ISDA currently has over 900 member institutions from 75 countries. These members include a broad spectrum of [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) [market](../m/market.md) participants such as corporations, investment managers, government and [supranational](../s/supranational.md) entities, [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies, energy and commodities firms, and international and regional banks.

## Mission and Objectives

ISDA's primary mission is to foster safe and efficient [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) markets to facilitate effective [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) for all users of [derivative](../d/derivative.md) products. The organization achieves this through:

- **Advocacy**: Working with regulators and policymakers globally to promote effective and efficient regulation of the [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) markets.
- **Standardization**: Delivering [industry](../i/industry.md) standards and strategies which include the development and maintenance of the [ISDA Master Agreement](../i/isda_master_agreement.md), which serves as a globally recognized standard for OTC [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) transactions.
- **Education**: Providing high-quality educational resources and training to [market](../m/market.md) participants.
- **Research and Analysis**: Conducting in-depth analysis of [market](../m/market.md) data and trends that impact the global [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) markets.

## ISDA Master Agreement

One of the ISDA's most significant contributions to the financial [industry](../i/industry.md) is the [ISDA Master Agreement](../i/isda_master_agreement.md). This document provides the legal framework for OTC [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) transactions and is used internationally by [market](../m/market.md) participants. It includes key provisions that govern the trading of [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), including:

- **[Netting](../n/netting.md)**: Mechanisms to calculate the net outstanding exposure between the two parties, reducing [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md).
- **Close-out Protocols**: Procedures in the case one party defaults on their [obligations](../o/obligation.md).
- **[Collateral](../c/collateral.md) Agreements**: Terms regarding the posting and handling of [collateral](../c/collateral.md) by parties to mitigate [credit](../c/credit.md) risks.

The [ISDA Master Agreement](../i/isda_master_agreement.md) helps ensure legal certainty and the enforceability of [netting](../n/netting.md) and [collateral](../c/collateral.md) arrangements in [multiple](../m/multiple.md) jurisdictions, which significantly reduces [systemic risk](../s/systemic_risk.md).

## Credit Support Annex (CSA)

Another critical document often used in conjunction with the [ISDA Master Agreement](../i/isda_master_agreement.md) is the [Credit](../c/credit.md) Support Annex (CSA). The CSA details the terms under which [collateral](../c/collateral.md) is posted or transferred between the parties to [offset](../o/offset.md) exposures arising from [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) transactions. The CSA includes specifics about the [valuation](../v/valuation.md) and replacement of [collateral](../c/collateral.md), thresholds, and minimum transfer amounts, contributing to [risk](../r/risk.md) mitigation practices.

## Legal Opinions

ISDA also produces and maintains a comprehensive library of legal opinions on the enforceability of [netting](../n/netting.md) and [collateral](../c/collateral.md) arrangements under the [ISDA Master Agreement](../i/isda_master_agreement.md). These opinions cover over 60 jurisdictions worldwide and provide legal certainty to [market](../m/market.md) participants about the validity of their transactions in different legal contexts. 

## Advocacy and Public Policy

ISDA actively engages with global regulators and policymakers to advocate for regulations that promote secure, efficient, and transparent [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) markets. Key areas of advocacy include:

- **[Clearing and Settlement](../c/clearing_and_settlement.md)**: Promoting central [clearing](../c/clearing.md) for standard [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) to reduce [counterparty risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md).
- **[Margin](../m/margin.md) Requirements**: Establishing [robust](../r/robust.md) [collateral](../c/collateral.md) frameworks to ensure [market](../m/market.md) stability.
- **[Market](../m/market.md) [Infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md)**: Enhancing the operational [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) of [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) markets through technological innovations and [best practices](../b/best_practices.md).
- **[Benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) Reform**: Leading [industry](../i/industry.md) efforts to transition away from LIBOR to alternative [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rates to ensure continued [market](../m/market.md) reliability and integrity.

## ISDA Protocols

ISDA develops and promotes standard protocols to facilitate [market](../m/market.md)-wide adherence to emerging regulations or significant [market](../m/market.md) events. These protocols allow [market](../m/market.md) participants to amend large numbers of contracts without the need to negotiate changes bilaterally. Some significant protocols include:

- **ISDA 2014 Resolution Stay Protocol**: Facilitating compliance with regulatory requirements for temporary stays on termination rights in certain financial transactions during the resolution of a failing financial institution.
- **ISDA 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol**: Enabling [market](../m/market.md) participants to incorporate [robust](../r/robust.md) fallback provisions for [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) contracts referencing interbank offered rates (IBORs) that are being replaced by alternative reference rates (ARRs).

## Education and Resources

ISDA offers a [wealth](../w/wealth.md) of educational resources, including conferences, webinars, and in-depth research reports. These resources cover a broad [range](../r/range.md) of topics, from introductory materials on [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) trading and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) to advanced discussions on regulatory developments and [market](../m/market.md) [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md).

## ISDA's Role in Benchmark Reform

A critical area where ISDA has recently played a pivotal role is in the transition from IBORs to ARRs. Following the manipulation cases and the subsequent announcement of the cessation of LIBOR, ISDA coordinated a global effort to develop [robust](../r/robust.md) fallback provisions for existing IBOR-referencing [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) contracts. This massive task involved consultation with [industry](../i/industry.md) stakeholders, drafting new legal documentation, and fostering [market](../m/market.md) readiness for the transition.

## ISDA SIMM (Standard Initial Margin Model)

Another significant ISDA initiative is the development of the Standard [Initial Margin](../i/initial_margin.md) Model (SIMM). This model is used for calculating [initial margin](../i/initial_margin.md) for uncleared [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) and adheres to international regulatory standards. SIMM promotes standardization, [transparency](../t/transparency.md), and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) in the calculation and [exchange](../e/exchange.md) of [initial margin](../i/initial_margin.md), facilitating compliance with [margin](../m/margin.md) requirements for non-centrally cleared [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md).

## ISDA Create

ISDA Create is a highly innovative platform launched to enable users to produce, deliver, negotiate, and execute [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) documentation online. This platform helps streamline documentation processes and enhance [operational efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md) while ensuring that all agreements meet ISDA standards.

## Conferences and Events

ISDA organizes numerous conferences and events annually, bringing together [industry](../i/industry.md) leaders, policymakers, and [market](../m/market.md) participants to discuss the latest trends, regulatory developments, and [market](../m/market.md) innovations. These events provide valuable [networking](../n/networking.md) opportunities and foster dialogue on critical issues facing the [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) markets.

# Investment Banking

Investment banking is a segment of the financial services industry that focuses on helping individuals, corporations, and governments raise capital and execute complex financial transactions. They perform a variety of roles, from advising on mergers and acquisitions (M&A) to managing initial public offerings (IPOs) and proprietary trading.

## Overview

Investment banking is often subdivided into two primary sectors, namely the sell side and the buy side. The sell side typically involves trading securities for cash or other securities, as well as the promotion of securities. Activities on the sell side include underwriting, research, and market-making. The buy side, in contrast, deals with advising institutions concerned with buying investment services. This includes entities such as mutual funds, pension funds, hedge funds, and proprietary trading desks.

Investment banks play several critical roles that include:

1. **Underwriting**: Underwriting involves assessing the risk associated with a new issuance of securities. They help their clients raise capital by issuing stocks or bonds to the public or to private investors.
   
2. **Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A)**: Investment banks offer strategic advice on mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, and other significant financial transactions. They help companies identify potential targets for acquisition, value these targets, and execute the transactions.

3. **Sales and Trading**: This is where the buy and sell orders are executed for institutional and retail clients. It also includes trading the firm's own capital as proprietary trading.
   
4. **Research**: Providing equity research and advice in multiple sectors helps clients make informed investment decisions. Analysts evaluate companies and sectors, rate securities, and provide insights into market trends.

5. **Asset Management**: Some investment banks also provide asset management services for individuals and institutions, managing investments on behalf of their clients.

6. **Structured Finance**: This involves creating complex financial products designed to meet specific needs, such as mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, and credit derivatives.

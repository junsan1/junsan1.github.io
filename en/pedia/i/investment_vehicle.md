# Investment Vehicle

In the world of [finance](../f/finance.md), an investment vehicle refers to a product used by investors with the intention of gaining positive returns.

Choosing the right investment vehicle is crucial for achieving financial goals while managing [risk](../r/risk.md) effectively.

## Stocks

[Stocks](../s/stock.md), also known as equities, represent ownership in a company. When you purchase stock in a company, you are essentially buying a piece of that company, known as a share.

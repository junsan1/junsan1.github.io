# iShares

## Introduction to iShares

iShares is a family of [exchange](../e/exchange.md)-traded funds (ETFs) managed by BlackRock. ETFs represent a type of [investment fund](../i/investment_fund.md) that holds a collection of assets such as [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, or other investments, and are traded on stock exchanges. iShares ETFs are designed to [offer](../o/offer.md) exposure to a [wide variety](../w/wide_variety.md) of [asset](../a/asset.md) classes, sectors, and geographies, providing investors with a flexible, cost-effective way to build diversified portfolios.

Since its introduction in 2000, iShares has become one of the most recognized and widely used brands in the ETF [market](../m/market.md). It offers a broad selection of ETFs that track both indices and [active management](../a/active_management.md) strategies. As of the end of 2022, iShares encompassed over 1,000 products globally, catering to a wide [range](../r/range.md) of [investor](../i/investor.md) needs.

## Key Features of iShares ETFs

### Diversification

One of the main advantages of iShares ETFs is [diversification](../d/diversification.md). By purchasing [shares](../s/shares.md) in an ETF, investors can [gain](../g/gain.md) exposure to a broad basket of individual securities without having to buy each one separately. This [diversification](../d/diversification.md) reduces [risk](../r/risk.md) by spreading investments across various assets.

### Cost Efficiency

iShares ETFs generally have lower [expense](../e/expense.md) ratios compared to traditional mutual funds. Lower fees are particularly significant in the long term, as they can significantly impact overall investment returns. Cost [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) is a crucial advantage that attracts investors looking for affordable investment vehicles.

### Liquidity

iShares ETFs are traded on major stock exchanges, which provides ease of buying and selling. The [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) of ETFs means that they can be bought and sold throughout trading hours at real-time prices.

### Transparency

iShares, like most ETFs, offers high levels of [transparency](../t/transparency.md). [Holdings](../h/holdings.md) of the ETFs are made public daily, which allows investors to see exactly what their ETFs own. This contrasts with many mutual funds, which typically disclose [holdings](../h/holdings.md) on a quarterly [basis](../b/basis.md).

### Flexibility

iShares ETFs cover a wide [range](../r/range.md) of [asset](../a/asset.md) classes and markets, [offering](../o/offering.md) flexibility to investors. Whether an [investor](../i/investor.md) is looking for exposure to U.S. equities, international markets, bonds, commodities, or specialized sectors, there is likely an iShares ETF that meets those needs.

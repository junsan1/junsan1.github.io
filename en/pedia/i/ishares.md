## Introduction to iShares

iShares is a family of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) managed by BlackRock. ETFs represent a type of investment fund that holds a collection of assets such as stocks, bonds, or other investments, and are traded on stock exchanges. iShares ETFs are designed to offer exposure to a wide variety of asset classes, sectors, and geographies, providing investors with a flexible, cost-effective way to build diversified portfolios.

Since its introduction in 2000, iShares has become one of the most recognized and widely used brands in the ETF market. It offers a broad selection of ETFs that track both indices and active management strategies. As of the end of 2022, iShares encompassed over 1,000 products globally, catering to a wide range of investor needs.

## Key Features of iShares ETFs

### Diversification

One of the main advantages of iShares ETFs is diversification. By purchasing shares in an ETF, investors can gain exposure to a broad basket of individual securities without having to buy each one separately. This diversification reduces risk by spreading investments across various assets.

### Cost Efficiency

iShares ETFs generally have lower expense ratios compared to traditional mutual funds. Lower fees are particularly significant in the long term, as they can significantly impact overall investment returns. Cost efficiency is a crucial advantage that attracts investors looking for affordable investment vehicles.

### Liquidity

iShares ETFs are traded on major stock exchanges, which provides ease of buying and selling. The liquidity of ETFs means that they can be bought and sold throughout trading hours at real-time prices.

### Transparency

iShares, like most ETFs, offers high levels of transparency. Holdings of the ETFs are made public daily, which allows investors to see exactly what their ETFs own. This contrasts with many mutual funds, which typically disclose holdings on a quarterly basis.

### Flexibility

iShares ETFs cover a wide range of asset classes and markets, offering flexibility to investors. Whether an investor is looking for exposure to U.S. equities, international markets, bonds, commodities, or specialized sectors, there is likely an iShares ETF that meets those needs.

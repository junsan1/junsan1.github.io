# Inverse ETFs

Inverse [Exchange](../e/exchange.md)-Traded Funds (ETFs) are financial instruments that allow investors to [profit](../p/profit.md) from a decline in the [value](../v/value.md) of a specific [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md). They achieve this by using various [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), such as swaps, [options](../o/options.md), and [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md), to deliver returns that are the inverse of the performance of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [index](../i/index.md) or [asset](../a/asset.md). In other words, if the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) falls by a certain percentage, the [inverse ETF](../i/inverse_etf.md) is designed to rise by that same percentage, and vice versa. These instruments are often used by traders looking to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) their portfolios, speculate on [market](../m/market.md) downturns, or [gain](../g/gain.md) short-term [profit](../p/profit.md) opportunities.

## How Inverse ETFs Work

Inverse ETFs utilize financial [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) to achieve their investment objectives. These [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) include:

### 1. Swaps
Swaps are contracts between two parties to [exchange](../e/exchange.md) cash flows or other financial instruments. Inverse ETFs generally use [equity](../e/equity.md) swaps where one party agrees to pay the returns of an [index](../i/index.md) while the other party agrees to pay the returns of another [asset](../a/asset.md) or rate of [interest](../i/interest.md).

### 2. Futures Contracts
[Futures](../f/futures.md) are standardized contracts to buy or sell a particular [asset](../a/asset.md) at a pre-determined price at a specified time in the future. Inverse ETFs often use [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) to bet against a particular [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md).

### 3. Options
[Options](../o/options.md) give investors the right but not the obligation to buy or sell an [asset](../a/asset.md) at a specified price before or on a specific date. Inverse ETFs can use [options](../o/options.md) to bet against the price of an [index](../i/index.md).

## Types of Inverse ETFs

Inverse ETFs come in various types depending on the level of inverse exposure they provide:

### 1. Single Inverse ETFs
These ETFs aim to provide the opposite performance of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [index](../i/index.md). For example, if the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [index](../i/index.md) declines by 1%, a single [inverse ETF](../i/inverse_etf.md) is designed to increase by 1%.

### 2. Double Inverse ETFs
Double Inverse ETFs seek to deliver twice the inverse performance of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [index](../i/index.md). If the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) falls by 1%, the double [inverse ETF](../i/inverse_etf.md) should rise by 2%.

### 3. Triple Inverse ETFs
These ETFs aim to provide three times the inverse of the daily performance of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [index](../i/index.md). If the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [index](../i/index.md) drops by 1%, the triple [inverse ETF](../i/inverse_etf.md) should theoretically increase by 3%.

## Common Uses of Inverse ETFs

### 1. Hedging
Investors use inverse ETFs as a [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against [market](../m/market.md) downturns or specific sector declines. Holding an [inverse ETF](../i/inverse_etf.md) can help [offset](../o/offset.md) losses in a long-only portfolio.

### 2. Speculation
Traders often use inverse ETFs to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on short-term declines in the markets or specific sectors. 

### 3. Diversification
Though risky, some investors use inverse ETFs as part of a diversified strategy to balance the risks of their broader investment portfolio.

## Risks and Drawbacks

### 1. Daily Rebalancing 
Inverse ETFs are designed to provide inverse performance on a daily [basis](../b/basis.md). Their returns do not correspond exactly to the inverse of the long-term performance of the [index](../i/index.md) due to the process of daily [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md).

### 2. Leverage Risk
Inverse ETFs that use [leverage](../l/leverage.md), such as double or triple inverse ETFs, amplify potential returns as well as potential losses. This makes them highly volatile.

### 3. Complexity
The use of [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) makes these ETFs complex and difficult to understand for the average [investor](../i/investor.md). 

### 4. Costs
Inverse ETFs usually have higher [expense](../e/expense.md) ratios compared to traditional ETFs due to the costs associated with the [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) they use.

## Conclusion

Inverse ETFs [offer](../o/offer.md) complex, yet potentially rewarding opportunities for investors and traders who seek to [profit](../p/profit.md) from [market](../m/market.md) downturns or [hedge](../h/hedge.md) their portfolios. However, they come with significant risks and costs, including daily [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md), [leverage](../l/leverage.md) [risk](../r/risk.md), and higher [expense](../e/expense.md) ratios. It is crucial for investors to thoroughly understand these instruments and consider their [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) and investment goals before [investing](../i/investing.md) in inverse ETFs.

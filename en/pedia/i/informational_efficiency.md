# Informational Efficiency

Informational [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) is a vital concept in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and is particularly relevant to [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). It refers to the extent to which [market](../m/market.md) prices of securities fully reflect all available information. An informationally efficient [market](../m/market.md) is one where prices at any given time represent the true [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) of securities, considering all public and private information. This is the essence of the [Efficient Market Hypothesis](../e/efficient_market_hypothesis.md) (EMH), first formulated by [economist](../e/economist.md) Eugene Fama. 

## Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)

EMH posits that it is impossible to "beat the [market](../m/market.md)" consistently on a [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted [basis](../b/basis.md) since [market](../m/market.md) prices should only react to new information. Hence, past price movements or trends cannot be used to predict future price movements. EMH is generally classified into three forms:

1. **[Weak Form Efficiency](../w/weak_form_efficiency.md)**: All past trading information is reflected in stock prices.
2. **Semi-Strong Form [Efficiency](../e/efficiency.md)**: All publicly available information is reflected in stock prices.
3. **Strong Form [Efficiency](../e/efficiency.md)**: All information, both public and private, is reflected in stock prices.

## Relevance to Algorithmic Trading

In [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), computers execute trades based on pre-set instructions or algorithms. The [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) of markets can influence the profitability and strategies of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) in various ways.

### Weak Form Efficiency and Algo Trading

In weak form efficient markets, the use of historical data to predict future price movements becomes ineffective. Therefore, [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) relying solely on [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) are unlikely to [yield](../y/yield.md) abnormal profits.

 - **[Technical Analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md)**: Strategies based on patterns in stock prices or volumes over time, like moving averages, [trend](../t/trend.md) lines, and [chart patterns](../c/chart_patterns.md).
 - **[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md)**: The process of testing the [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) on historical data wouldn't provide a reliable indication of future performance.

### Semi-Strong Form Efficiency and Algo Trading

For semi-strong form efficient markets, the use of any publicly available information, including [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) and news reports, should already be incorporated into stock prices. Consequently, [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) strategies need to react exceedingly quickly to new public information to [gain](../g/gain.md) any advantage.

 - **News-Based [Trading Algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md)**: These algorithms parse news articles, [social media](../s/social_media.md) posts, and press releases using [natural language processing](../n/natural_language_processing_(nlp)_in_trading.md) (NLP) techniques to act on new information as quickly as possible.
 - **[Earnings Announcements](../e/earnings_announcements.md)**: [Trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) analyze [earnings](../e/earnings.md) reports and related metrics rapidly to predict price movements.
 
### Strong Form Efficiency and Algo Trading

If markets were strongly efficient, no information, including that known to company insiders, would give a trading advantage. Under this paradigm, even [insider trading](../i/insider.md) would not provide abnormal returns.

 - **[Insider Trading](../i/insider.md)**: Strategies relying on insider information are theoretically nullified.
 - **[Market](../m/market.md) Surveillance**: Algorithms can still be used for [market](../m/market.md) surveillance activities by regulatory bodies to detect anomalies signaling [insider trading](../i/insider.md).

## Challenges to Informational Efficiency

Although EMH provides a theoretical framework, real-world markets often exhibit inefficiencies due to various factors.

### Behavioral Finance

[Behavioral finance](../b/behavioral_finance.md) suggests that [cognitive biases](../c/cognitive_biases_in_trading.md) and emotional responses cause deviations from pure rationality in trading decisions.

- **[Herd Behavior](../h/herd_behavior_in_trading.md)**: Tendency of investors to follow the crowd.
- **Overconfidence**: Overestimating one's own ability to predict [market](../m/market.md) movements.

### Market Anomalies

Markets exhibit patterns or anomalies that contradict EMH.

- **[Momentum](../m/momentum.md) Effect**: [Stocks](../s/stock.md) that have performed well recently tend to continue to perform well in the short term.
- **[January Effect](../j/january_effect.md)**: [Stocks](../s/stock.md), particularly small-cap [stocks](../s/stock.md), often exhibit higher returns in January than other months.

### Information Asymmetry

Different [market](../m/market.md) participants may have access to different levels and quality of information.

- **[Insider Trading](../i/insider.md)**: Company insiders may have access to non-public information.
- **Information Cascades**: Investors may base their decisions on the observations of others rather than their private information.

## Conclusion

Informational [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) is a cornerstone of modern financial theory and has significant implications for [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). While the [Efficient Market Hypothesis](../e/efficient_market_hypothesis.md) serves as a useful theoretical model, real-world deviations in [market](../m/market.md) behavior [offer](../o/offer.md) both challenges and opportunities for algorithmic traders. Companies specializing in this field continuously adapt their strategies to exploit the occasional inefficiencies, thus contributing to the complex and dynamic nature of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

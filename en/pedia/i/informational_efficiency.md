# Informational Efficiency

Informational efficiency is a vital concept in the financial markets and is particularly relevant to [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). It refers to the extent to which market prices of securities fully reflect all available information. An informationally efficient market is one where prices at any given time represent the true intrinsic value of securities, considering all public and private information. This is the essence of the [Efficient Market Hypothesis](../e/efficient_market_hypothesis.md) (EMH), first formulated by economist Eugene Fama. 

## Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)

EMH posits that it is impossible to "beat the market" consistently on a risk-adjusted basis since market prices should only react to new information. Hence, past price movements or trends cannot be used to predict future price movements. EMH is generally classified into three forms:

1. **Weak Form Efficiency**: All past trading information is reflected in stock prices.
2. **Semi-Strong Form Efficiency**: All publicly available information is reflected in stock prices.
3. **Strong Form Efficiency**: All information, both public and private, is reflected in stock prices.

## Relevance to Algorithmic Trading

In [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), computers execute trades based on pre-set instructions or algorithms. The efficiency of markets can influence the profitability and strategies of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) in various ways.

### Weak Form Efficiency and Algo Trading

In weak form efficient markets, the use of historical data to predict future price movements becomes ineffective. Therefore, [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) relying solely on [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) are unlikely to yield abnormal profits.

 - **[Technical Analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md)**: Strategies based on patterns in stock prices or volumes over time, like moving averages, trend lines, and [chart patterns](../c/chart_patterns.md).
 - **[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md)**: The process of testing the trading strategy on historical data wouldn't provide a reliable indication of future performance.

### Semi-Strong Form Efficiency and Algo Trading

For semi-strong form efficient markets, the use of any publicly available information, including financial statements and news reports, should already be incorporated into stock prices. Consequently, [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) strategies need to react exceedingly quickly to new public information to gain any advantage.

 - **News-Based [Trading Algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md)**: These algorithms parse news articles, social media posts, and press releases using [natural language processing](../n/natural_language_processing_(nlp)_in_trading.md) (NLP) techniques to act on new information as quickly as possible.
 - **[Earnings Announcements](../e/earnings_announcements.md)**: [Trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) analyze earnings reports and related metrics rapidly to predict price movements.
 
### Strong Form Efficiency and Algo Trading

If markets were strongly efficient, no information, including that known to company insiders, would give a trading advantage. Under this paradigm, even insider trading would not provide abnormal returns.

 - **Insider Trading**: Strategies relying on insider information are theoretically nullified.
 - **Market Surveillance**: Algorithms can still be used for market surveillance activities by regulatory bodies to detect anomalies signaling insider trading.

## Challenges to Informational Efficiency

Although EMH provides a theoretical framework, real-world markets often exhibit inefficiencies due to various factors.

### Behavioral Finance

[Behavioral finance](../b/behavioral_finance.md) suggests that [cognitive biases](../c/cognitive_biases_in_trading.md) and emotional responses cause deviations from pure rationality in trading decisions.

- **[Herd Behavior](../h/herd_behavior_in_trading.md)**: Tendency of investors to follow the crowd.
- **Overconfidence**: Overestimating one's own ability to predict market movements.

### Market Anomalies

Markets exhibit patterns or anomalies that contradict EMH.

- **Momentum Effect**: Stocks that have performed well recently tend to continue to perform well in the short term.
- **[January Effect](../j/january_effect.md)**: Stocks, particularly small-cap stocks, often exhibit higher returns in January than other months.

### Information Asymmetry

Different market participants may have access to different levels and quality of information.

- **Insider Trading**: Company insiders may have access to non-public information.
- **Information Cascades**: Investors may base their decisions on the observations of others rather than their private information.

## Conclusion

Informational efficiency is a cornerstone of modern financial theory and has significant implications for [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). While the [Efficient Market Hypothesis](../e/efficient_market_hypothesis.md) serves as a useful theoretical model, real-world deviations in market behavior offer both challenges and opportunities for algorithmic traders. Companies specializing in this field continuously adapt their strategies to exploit the occasional inefficiencies, thus contributing to the complex and dynamic nature of financial markets.

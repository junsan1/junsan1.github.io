# Indirect Method

The indirect method is a way of preparing a statement of cash flows in [accounting](../a/accounting.md). The statement of cash flows is a crucial financial document that provides users with information about a company's cash [receipts](../r/receipt.md) and cash payments during a specified period. The indirect method adjusts net [income](../i/income.md) for the changes in [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) accounts to calculate the cash from [operating activities](../o/operating_activities.md). This method focuses on reconciling net [income](../i/income.md) to [net cash](../n/net_cash.md) provided by [operating activities](../o/operating_activities.md) by identifying and removing non-cash transactions.

## Understanding the Indirect Method

The indirect method starts with the net [income](../i/income.md) from the [income statement](../i/income_statement.md). Net [income](../i/income.md) is the starting point because it is derived on an accrual [basis](../b/basis.md), which means it includes non-cash items. To convert net [income](../i/income.md) into [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) from operations, incremental changes in certain [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) accounts are added or deducted, providing a clearer picture of cash inflows and outflows.

### Steps to Prepare the Indirect Method

1. **Start with Net [Income](../i/income.md)**: Begin by taking the net [income](../i/income.md) from the [income statement](../i/income_statement.md).
2. **Adjust for Non-Cash Items**: Add back any non-cash expenses such as [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md), amortization, and losses. Subtract non-cash gains.
3. **Adjust for Changes in Working [Capital](../c/capital.md)**: Analyze and adjust for changes in [current assets](../c/current_assets.md) (e.g., accounts [receivable](../r/receivable.md), [inventory](../i/inventory.md)) and [current liabilities](../c/current_liabilities.md) (e.g., accounts payable) that impact cash flows.
4. **Adjust for Non-Operating Gains and Losses**: Identify and adjust any non-operating gains or losses that affect net [income](../i/income.md) but do not impact [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) from operations.

### Example

To illustrate, hereâ€™s a simplified example of preparing a [cash flow statement](../c/cash_flow_statement.md) using the indirect method:

- **Net [Income](../i/income.md)**: $100,000
- **Add back [Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md)**: $20,000
- **Subtract Gains from [Sale](../s/sale.md) of Equipment**: $5,000
- **Increase in Accounts [Receivable](../r/receivable.md)**: $(10,000)
- **Decrease in Inventories**: $5,000
- **Increase in Accounts Payable**: $15,000

Calculating [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md) from [Operating Activities](../o/operating_activities.md):

Net [Income](../i/income.md): \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  $100,000  
Add [Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md): \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  $20,000  
Subtract Gains: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  $(5,000)  
Decrease in AR: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__ $(10,000)  
Decrease in [Inventory](../i/inventory.md): \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  $5,000  
Increase in AP: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  $15,000  
**[Operating Activities](../o/operating_activities.md) Net [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md)**: _\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  $125,000

## Advantages of the Indirect Method

1. **[Reconciliation](../r/reconciliation.md)**: It clearly shows the relationship between net [income](../i/income.md) and [net cash](../n/net_cash.md) from [operating activities](../o/operating_activities.md).
2. **Comprehensive Insight**: The method offers a detailed view of how [operating income](../o/operating_income.md) is adjusted to [net cash](../n/net_cash.md) by focusing on changes in [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) items.
3. **Ease of Preparation**: Many accountants find it more straightforward as it links directly with the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) and [income statement](../i/income_statement.md).
4. **Widely Used**: Due to ease and comprehensive overview, many companies prefer this method.

## Disadvantages of the Indirect Method

1. **Complex Adjustments**: The numerous adjustments may seem complex and cumbersome to some users.
2. **Delayed Cash Impact**: This method can obscure the actual timing of cash flows.

## Application in Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) (or algo trading) is a trading process that uses advanced [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md) and software programs to make high-speed trading decisions. The indirect method, while predominantly an [accounting](../a/accounting.md) technique, can influence [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) in several ways:

### Data Analysis and Modeling

The [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) of a target company or [asset](../a/asset.md), derived from [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) including the statement of cash flows, can provide essential data input for algorithmic models. Understanding the incoming and outgoing cash flows can help in forming trading decisions.

### Fundamental Analysis Integration

Algo [trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md) employing [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md) may use elements from the indirect method, such as net [income](../i/income.md) adjustments and working [capital](../c/capital.md) changes, to assess the [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) of a stock or [asset](../a/asset.md).

### Risk Management

Algorithms that [factor](../f/factor.md) in [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and [liquidity analysis](../l/liquidity_analysis.md) benefit from the insights provided through the indirect method. This can help in identifying companies with strong cash flows and potentially lower risks.

### Flash Crashes and Market Stability

Understanding cash flows through the indirect method can help algorithms adjust their [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) during periods of financial stress, potentially mitigating the impact of [flash crashes](../f/flash_crashes.md) and enhancing [market](../m/market.md) stability.

## Companies Utilizing Indirect Method

Though the method itself is a part of financial reporting and not directly associated with specific companies' [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), many multinational corporations use this method for preparing their [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) statements. For example:

- [Microsoft Corporation](https://www.microsoft.com)
- [Apple Inc.](https://www.apple.com)
- [Alphabet Inc. (Google)](https://www.abc.xyz)

Each of these companies provides financial reports that often include detailed [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) statements using the indirect method, helping investors and analysts comprehend their [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) more effectively.

## Conclusion

The indirect method stands as a crucial [accounting](../a/accounting.md) tool for preparing [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) statements, [offering](../o/offering.md) significant insights into the financial operations of a [business](../b/business.md). By beginning with net [income](../i/income.md) and adjusting for non-cash transactions and changes in working [capital](../c/capital.md), the method provides a comprehensive view of cash flows from [operating activities](../o/operating_activities.md). Its application expands to various fields, including [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), where it can serve as a fundamental data source for making informed trading decisions.

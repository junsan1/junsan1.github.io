# Imperfect Competition

Imperfect competition is a [market](../m/market.md) structure that does not meet the rigorous standards of [perfect competition](../p/perfect_competition.md). This term covers a [range](../r/range.md) of [market](../m/market.md) structures—including [monopoly](../m/monopoly.md), [oligopoly](../o/oligopoly.md), [monopolistic competition](../m/monopolistic_competition.md), and [monopsony](../m/monopsony.md)—that lie between the extremes of [perfect competition](../p/perfect_competition.md) and pure [monopoly](../m/monopoly.md).

## Introduction

In economic theory, [perfect competition](../p/perfect_competition.md) represents an idealized form of [market](../m/market.md) structure in which no single [firm](../f/firm.md) or consumer has the power to influence the [market price](../m/market_price.md). However, such a [market](../m/market.md) structure is rarely, if ever, observed in the real world. Instead, most markets operate under conditions of imperfect competition. This concept, first extensively discussed by Edward Chamberlin and Joan Robinson in the early 20th century, refers to [market](../m/market.md) structures where individual firms have some control over the prices or at least some [market power](../m/market_power.md).

## Types of Imperfect Competition

### 1. Monopoly

A [monopoly](../m/monopoly.md) exists when a single [firm](../f/firm.md) is the sole producer of a product or service in a [market](../m/market.md) with no close substitutes. This [firm](../f/firm.md) retains significant pricing power and faces high [barriers to entry](../b/barriers_to_entry.md), which prevent other companies from entering the [market](../m/market.md).

- **Example**: A classic example would be [utility](../u/utility.md) companies, such as electricity providers in certain regions. These are often regulated to prevent abuse of [monopoly](../m/monopoly.md) power.

### 2. Oligopoly

An [oligopoly](../o/oligopoly.md) is a [market](../m/market.md) structure characterized by a small number of large firms that dominate the [market](../m/market.md). These firms have significant influence over [market](../m/market.md) prices, especially when they cooperate, either explicitly or implicitly.

- **Example**: The automotive [industry](../i/industry.md) is a good example, with a few large players like Toyota, Volkswagen, and Ford dominating the [market](../m/market.md).

### 3. Monopolistic Competition

[Monopolistic competition](../m/monopolistic_competition.md) describes a [market](../m/market.md) structure in which many firms sell products that are similar but not identical. Each [firm](../f/firm.md) retains some degree of [market power](../m/market_power.md) due to [product differentiation](../p/product_differentiation.md) but faces competition from other firms.

- **Example**: The fast-food [industry](../i/industry.md), where companies like McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's sell similar but differentiated products.

### 4. Monopsony

A [monopsony](../m/monopsony.md) exists when there is only one buyer in the [market](../m/market.md), giving that buyer substantial control over prices. This is particularly relevant in labor markets where a single employer dominates.

- **Example**: A company town where one [firm](../f/firm.md) is the primary employer.

## Characteristics of Imperfect Competition

### 1. Market Power

Under conditions of imperfect competition, firms have some degree of [market power](../m/market_power.md) which allows them to influence prices. This contrasts with [perfect competition](../p/perfect_competition.md), where firms are price takers.

### 2. Barriers to Entry

Imperfectly competitive markets often have significant [barriers to entry](../b/barriers_to_entry.md), which can include high [startup](../s/startup.md) costs, stringent regulations, or unique resources. These barriers protect existing firms from new entrants and sustain their [market power](../m/market_power.md).

### 3. Product Differentiation

In many imperfectly competitive markets, firms differentiate their products from those of competitors. This differentiation creates [brand loyalty](../b/brand_loyalty.md) and reduces the direct price competition that characterizes perfectly competitive markets.

### 4. Economic Profits

Firms in imperfectly competitive markets can earn long-term economic profits due to their [market power](../m/market_power.md). In [perfect competition](../p/perfect_competition.md), economic profits attract new entrants, driving profits to zero in the [long run](../l/long_run.md).

### 5. Imperfect Information

In imperfectly competitive markets, information is often not perfectly shared among participants. This asymmetry can give some firms competitive advantages.

## Measuring Imperfect Competition

Economists often use several metrics to measure the degree of imperfection in a [market](../m/market.md).

### 1. Concentration Ratios

Concentration ratios measure the [market share](../m/market_share.md) of the largest firms in the [industry](../i/industry.md). A high [concentration ratio](../c/concentration_ratio.md) indicates that a few firms dominate the [market](../m/market.md), suggesting oligopolistic or monopolistic structures. The four-[firm](../f/firm.md) [concentration ratio](../c/concentration_ratio.md) (CR4) is a commonly used measure, which sums the [market](../m/market.md) [shares](../s/shares.md) of the four largest firms. 

### 2. The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI)

HHI is another measure of [market](../m/market.md) concentration, calculated as the sum of the squares of the [market](../m/market.md) [shares](../s/shares.md) of all firms in the [industry](../i/industry.md). Higher values of HHI indicate a higher degree of [market](../m/market.md) concentration and less competitive markets.

## Theories and Models

### 1. Cournot Model

The Cournot model describes an [oligopoly](../o/oligopoly.md) where firms compete on the quantity of output they decide to produce. Each [firm](../f/firm.md) makes its production decision assuming the output of its competitors is fixed, and [market price](../m/market_price.md) is determined by the total output produced by all firms.

### 2. Bertrand Model

In contrast to the Cournot model, the Bertrand model describes an [oligopoly](../o/oligopoly.md) where firms compete on price rather than quantity. Each [firm](../f/firm.md) assumes the prices set by their competitors remain constant. 

### 3. Stackelberg Model

The Stackelberg model describes a situation where firms compete on quantity but move sequentially rather than simultaneously. One [firm](../f/firm.md) becomes the leader, making its output decision first, and the other firms follow.

### 4. Monopolistic Competition Model

This model assumes a large number of firms compete with differentiated products. Each [firm](../f/firm.md) has some degree of [market power](../m/market_power.md), but none can dictate [market](../m/market.md) conditions. Firms compete on price, quality, and [marketing](../m/marketing.md) to attract consumers.

## Policy Implications

Governments often intervene in imperfectly competitive markets to correct [market power](../m/market_power.md) abuses and enhance competition.

### 1. Antitrust Laws

[Antitrust](../a/antitrust.md) laws aim to prevent mergers and acquisitions that would reduce competition and to dismantle monopolistic practices. 

- **Example**: The United States’ [Sherman Antitrust Act](../s/sherman_antitrust_act.md) and the [European Union](../e/european_union_(eu).md)’s competition laws.

### 2. Regulation

Regulatory bodies may oversee industries where natural monopolies exist or where competition is limited. These regulations can control prices, set standards, and ensure fair practices.

- **Example**: The Federal Communications [Commission](../c/commission.md) (FCC) in the U.S. regulates telecommunications to ensure fair competition and service standards.

### 3. Subsidies and Support Programs

Governments can also use subsidies and support programs to help new firms enter a [market](../m/market.md) and compete with established players.

## Real-World Examples of Imperfect Competition

### 1. Technology Industry

The [technology sector](../t/technology_sector.md) has many examples of imperfect competition due to high entry barriers and significant [economies of scale](../e/economies_of_scale.md). Companies like Google and Apple have substantial [market power](../m/market_power.md) in their respective segments.

### 2. Pharmaceutical Industry

Pharmaceutical companies often operate under monopolistic conditions due to patents, which [grant](../g/grant.md) them exclusive rights to produce a drug for a certain period.

- **Link**: Pfizer ([https://www.pfizer.com/](https://www.pfizer.com/))

### 3. Retail Industry

Retail markets, particularly e-[commerce](../c/commerce.md), show characteristics of [monopolistic competition](../m/monopolistic_competition.md). Companies like Amazon dominate the [market](../m/market.md) but still face competition from firms [offering](../o/offering.md) differentiated products.

## Conclusion

Imperfect competition is a broad concept that encompasses various [market](../m/market.md) structures lying between [perfect competition](../p/perfect_competition.md) and [monopoly](../m/monopoly.md). Understanding these structures helps economists analyze [market](../m/market.md) behavior, [firm](../f/firm.md) strategies, and the impacts of public policies to ensure competitive markets and consumer [welfare](../w/welfare.md).

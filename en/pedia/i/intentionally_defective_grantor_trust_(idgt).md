# Intentionally Defective Grantor Trust (IDGT)

An Intentionally Defective [Grantor](../g/grantor.md) [Trust](../t/trust.md) (IDGT) is a sophisticated [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md) tool primarily used to reduce [estate](../e/estate.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) by transferring appreciating assets to heirs during a [grantor](../g/grantor.md)'s lifetime. The "defective" nature of the [trust](../t/trust.md) is intentional and refers to the [grantor](../g/grantor.md) [trust](../t/trust.md) status for [income tax](../i/income_tax.md) purposes, which results in the [grantor](../g/grantor.md) being liable for the [trust](../t/trust.md)’s [income](../i/income.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md). Consequently, this setup allows the [trust](../t/trust.md)'s assets to grow without diminishing due to tax [obligations](../o/obligation.md), as the [grantor](../g/grantor.md)’s [payment](../p/payment.md) of the [income](../i/income.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) is considered a [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md) gift to the [trust](../t/trust.md) beneficiaries.

## Essential Characteristics

### Grantor Trust Status

A cornerstone of an IDGT is that it is designed in a way that, although it removes assets from the [grantor](../g/grantor.md)'s [estate](../e/estate.md) for [estate tax](../e/estate_tax.md) purposes, it is still considered a [grantor](../g/grantor.md) [trust](../t/trust.md) for [federal income](../f/federal_income.md) tax purposes. This is achieved by including specific provisions in the [trust](../t/trust.md) documents that create "defects," making the [trust](../t/trust.md) a [grantor](../g/grantor.md) [trust](../t/trust.md). Accordingly, all [income](../i/income.md), deductions, and credits related to the [trust](../t/trust.md)'s assets are reported on the [grantor](../g/grantor.md)'s personal [tax return](../t/tax_return.md).

### Estate Tax Benefits

One of the main advantages of an IDGT is its ability to effectively transfer [wealth](../w/wealth.md) to heirs while minimizing [estate](../e/estate.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md). By selling appreciating assets to the IDGT in [exchange](../e/exchange.md) for a [promissory note](../p/promissory_note.md), the [grantor](../g/grantor.md) can freeze the [value](../v/value.md) of those assets for [estate tax](../e/estate_tax.md) purposes, as any post-[sale](../s/sale.md) appreciation occurs outside the [grantor](../g/grantor.md)’s taxable [estate](../e/estate.md). Typically, the [trust](../t/trust.md) pays for the assets with an installment [note](../n/note.md), and the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) on the [note](../n/note.md) must be at least the applicable federal rate (AFR).

### Transactions Between Grantor and IDGT

Intra-family sales to an IDGT can be structured in a way that allows for the [valuation](../v/valuation.md) discounts on the transferred assets, thereby further reducing the overall tax burden. Commonly, these sales involve closely-held [business](../b/business.md) interests, discounted minority interests, or funding the [trust](../t/trust.md) with a seed gift to facilitate the installment [sale](../s/sale.md) [transaction](../t/transaction.md). As the [grantor](../g/grantor.md) continues to pay the [trust](../t/trust.md)'s [income](../i/income.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md), they further deplete their taxable [estate](../e/estate.md) without considering the tax payments as additional gifts.

## Creation and Implementation

### Forming an IDGT

Setting up an IDGT involves drafting a [trust](../t/trust.md) agreement that includes the requisite "defects" to qualify as a [grantor](../g/grantor.md) [trust](../t/trust.md) for [income tax](../i/income_tax.md) purposes but remains irrevocable for [estate tax](../e/estate_tax.md) purposes. Legal counsel's [guidance](../g/guidance.md) is essential in tailoring the [trust](../t/trust.md) document to mitigate potential disputes with the IRS, particularly in areas such as [grantor](../g/grantor.md) retained annuity trusts (GRATs), [grantor](../g/grantor.md) retained unitrusts (GRUTs), and installment sales.

### Funding the Trust

An initial "seed" gift is typically made to the [trust](../t/trust.md) to establish economic substance and support subsequent installment sales. This seed gift should be valued at approximately 10% of the [value](../v/value.md) of the assets intended for [sale](../s/sale.md) to the [trust](../t/trust.md). Following this, the [grantor](../g/grantor.md) sells assets to the [trust](../t/trust.md) at fair [market value](../m/market_value.md), in [return](../r/return.md) for a [promissory note](../p/promissory_note.md).

### Sales Techniques and Discounting

Assets sold to the IDGT often qualify for [valuation](../v/valuation.md) discounts, such as lack of control or marketability discounts, which can significantly reduce their taxable [value](../v/value.md). These discounts are particularly relevant when transferring non-controlling interests in privately-held businesses or fractional interests in [real estate](../r/real_estate.md).

## Tax Considerations

### Income Tax Implications

The [grantor](../g/grantor.md) must include all [trust](../t/trust.md) [income](../i/income.md) on their personal [tax return](../t/tax_return.md), and any [income](../i/income.md) [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md) is owed by the [grantor](../g/grantor.md). This can be advantageous as the [trust](../t/trust.md)'s assets grow unencumbered by [income](../i/income.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md). The [trust](../t/trust.md) itself maintains tax-exempt status for the [income](../i/income.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) paid by the [grantor](../g/grantor.md).

### Estate and Gift Tax Implications

Since the assets are removed from the [grantor](../g/grantor.md)'s [estate](../e/estate.md), any appreciation after the transfer escapes [estate](../e/estate.md) [taxation](../t/taxation.md). Additionally, paying the [income tax](../i/income_tax.md) on the [trust](../t/trust.md)’s [income](../i/income.md) is considered a [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md) gift by the [grantor](../g/grantor.md), thus further diminishing the [grantor](../g/grantor.md)'s taxable [estate](../e/estate.md).

### Regulatory Compliance

Adhering to IRS guidelines and maintaining thorough documentation is critical for an IDGT. Properly drafted [trust](../t/trust.md) documents and [valuation](../v/valuation.md) reports help defend against IRS scrutiny. Regulation focuses on ensuring that economic substance and [business](../b/business.md) purposes are present in transactions.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

1. **[Estate Tax](../e/estate_tax.md) Reduction:** The main benefit is the ability to transfer assets outside of the taxable [estate](../e/estate.md).
2. **[Grantor](../g/grantor.md) Paying [Taxes](../t/taxes.md) is a Gift:** The [grantor](../g/grantor.md)’s [payment](../p/payment.md) of [income](../i/income.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) reduces the [estate](../e/estate.md) without being treated as a taxable gift.
3. **[Asset](../a/asset.md) Appreciation:** Future appreciation of transferred assets occurs outside the [estate](../e/estate.md).
4. **[Income](../i/income.md) Retention:** Assets in the [trust](../t/trust.md) can still generate [income](../i/income.md) benefiting beneficiaries without tax considerations from [asset](../a/asset.md) increase.

### Disadvantages

1. **[Tax Liability](../t/tax_liability.md):** The [grantor](../g/grantor.md) bears the [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md) on [trust](../t/trust.md) [income](../i/income.md), which can be substantial.
2. **Complexity and Costs:** Establishing and maintaining an IDGT involves significant legal and administrative costs.
3. **IRS Scrutiny:** Certain aspects, like [valuation](../v/valuation.md) discounts and transactions, may be closely scrutinized by the IRS.

## Case Studies and Applications

### Business Succession Planning

IDGTs are notable for their application in [business](../b/business.md) succession planning. Owners of closely-held businesses can transfer [business](../b/business.md) interests to an IDGT, enabling the [business](../b/business.md) to remain under family control while minimizing [estate](../e/estate.md) and gift [taxes](../t/taxes.md). This often involves intricate [valuation techniques](../v/valuation_techniques.md) and long-term installment planning to maximize tax efficiencies.

### Real Estate Investments

Another common application is in the realm of [real estate](../r/real_estate.md). By transferring fractional interests in [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) properties to an IDGT, grantors can utilize [valuation](../v/valuation.md) discounts, significantly reducing [estate tax](../e/estate_tax.md) exposure. The [trust](../t/trust.md) may also benefit from rental [income](../i/income.md) and eventual appreciation without immediate tax consequences.

### High-Net-Worth Individuals

For high-net-worth individuals, especially those with sizeable and diverse [asset](../a/asset.md) portfolios, IDGTs [offer](../o/offer.md) a tailored approach to [asset](../a/asset.md) transfer and [tax planning](../t/tax_planning.md). By leveraging advanced [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md) tools and strategies, they can ensure that [wealth](../w/wealth.md) is preserved and transferred according to their wishes while mitigating tax impacts.

## Professional Services and Resources

1. **Law Firms:** Specialized [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md) law firms play a crucial role in drafting IDGTs, ensuring compliance with tax laws, and structuring transactions to maximize benefits. Notable firms include [WealthCounsel](https://www.wealthcounsel.com/) and [Pillsbury Law](https://www.pillsburylaw.com/).

2. **Financial Advisors:** Financial advisors assist in [asset valuation](../a/asset_valuation.md), performance estimation, and the structuring of [estate](../e/estate.md) plans involving IDGTs. They provide projections and advice on maintaining economic balance and maximizing tax benefits.

3. **[Valuation](../v/valuation.md) Experts:** Accurate and defensible [asset](../a/asset.md) valuations are critical to the success of IDGT transactions. Firms like [American Society of Appraisers](https://www.appraisers.org/) [offer](../o/offer.md) services to ensure fair [market value](../m/market_value.md) assessments.

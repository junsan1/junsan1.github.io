# Investment Advisers Act of 1940

The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 is a United States federal law that regulates the activities of investment advisers. Enacted as part of a series of financial reforms following the [Great Depression](../g/great_depression.md), the Act’s main objective was to protect investors from malpractices by mandating that individuals and firms providing investment advice must register with the U.S. Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) and adhere to specified standards of conduct.

## Historical Background

The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 was enacted in the context of a broader series of financial regulatory reforms introduced during Franklin D. Roosevelt’s [New Deal](../n/new_deal.md) era. After the [stock market crash](../s/stock_market_crash.md) of 1929 and the subsequent [Great Depression](../g/great_depression.md), it became evident that many financial [market](../m/market.md) participants were engaging in unethical behavior. The [Securities Act of 1933](../s/securities_act_of_1933.md) and the [Securities Exchange Act of 1934](../s/securities_exchange_act_of_1934.md) had already laid some groundwork for securities regulation, but there was a growing concern about the conduct of those providing investment advice. Thus, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 emerged as a targeted attempt to tackle these issues.

## Definitions and Scope

### Investment Adviser

The term “investment adviser” is broadly defined under the Act to include any person or [firm](../f/firm.md) that engages in the [business](../b/business.md) of providing advice, making recommendations, issuing reports, or furnishing analyses on securities, either directly or through publications, for compensation. This definition broadly covers a variety of professionals, including individual advisers, financial planners, and even firms.

### Clients

The Act primarily focuses on advisers who manage assets for individuals and institutions, but its provisions also apply to advisers serving investment companies.

## Registration and Exemptions

### Registration Requirements

Investment advisers who fall under the purview of the Act are generally required to register with the SEC by filing [Form ADV](../f/form_adv.md), which includes detailed information about the adviser’s [business](../b/business.md), conflicts of [interest](../i/interest.md), and disciplinary history. Registered advisers are subject to regulatory oversight and are required to update [Form ADV](../f/form_adv.md) annually.

### Exemptions

Certain investment advisers are exempt from registration, including:

1. **Advisers with fewer than 15 clients and who do not publicly [hold](../h/hold.md) themselves out as investment advisers**.
2. **Advisers whose only clients are [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies**.
3. **Advisers that are charities or non-profits**.
4. **Intrastate advisers** whose clients are all residents of the state in which the adviser maintains its [principal](../p/principal.md) office and place of [business](../b/business.md), and who do not provide advice on [listed](../l/listed.md) securities or national [market](../m/market.md) system securities.

## Fiduciary Duty

One of the cornerstone principles of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 is the fiduciary duty it imposes on investment advisers. This duty requires advisers to act with the utmost good faith and in the best interests of their clients. Specific fiduciary [obligations](../o/obligation.md) include:

1. **Duty of Loyalty**: Advisers must disclose any conflicts of [interest](../i/interest.md) to their clients and must not benefit at the client's [expense](../e/expense.md).
2. **Duty of Care**: Advisers should provide advice that is in the best [interest](../i/interest.md) of the client after taking into account the client's financial situation and objectives.

## Regulatory Measures and Compliance

### Books and Records

Registered investment advisers are required to maintain accurate and up-to-date books and records relevant to their advisory [business](../b/business.md). These records must be available for inspection by the SEC.

### Advertising Rules

The Investment Advisers Act places strict regulations on how investment advisers can [market](../m/market.md) their services. Advertising materials must not contain any untrue statements or omissions of material facts. They are also prohibited from using testimonials or guaranteeing future performance.

## Prohibited Practices

The Act identifies several practices that are prohibited for investment advisers, including:

1. **Defrauding clients**.
2. **Engaging in manipulative or deceitful practices**.
3. **Acting as [principal](../p/principal.md) or agent in a [transaction](../t/transaction.md) without disclosing all essential facts and obtaining client consent**.

## Enforcement and Penalties

The SEC has broad authority to enforce the provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Penalties for non-compliance can include fines, suspension, or revocation of registration. In severe cases, criminal charges may be brought against the offending adviser.

## Amendments and Updates

Over the decades, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 has been amended several times to address new [market](../m/market.md) developments and regulatory challenges. Notable amendments include:

### Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act

Enacted in 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act included provisions that widened the [scope](../s/scope.md) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. It required advisers managing [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds and [private equity](../p/private_equity.md) funds to register with the SEC if they had assets under management above certain thresholds. It also imposed increased reporting requirements on advisers to improve [transparency](../t/transparency.md).

### National Securities Markets Improvement Act (NSMIA)

Passed in 1996, NSMIA preempted state registration requirements for SEC-registered advisers and introduced a distinction between "federal covered advisers" (those required to register with the SEC) and other advisers subject to state regulation.

## Modern Relevance

In recent years, the emergence of robo-advisers and [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) has posed new challenges for the regulatory framework established under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Robo-advisers are automated platforms that provide algorithm-driven [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md) services with a minimal amount of human intervention. While they strive to [offer](../o/offer.md) personalized investment advice, questions about fiduciary responsibility and [transparency](../t/transparency.md) have necessitated the development of new guidelines to ensure they adhere to the principles of the Act.

## Investment Adviser Registration Depository (IARD)

The Investment Adviser Registration [Depository](../d/depository.md) (IARD) is an electronic system that facilitates the filing of Forms ADV by investment advisers. Launched by the SEC, the IARD provides a comprehensive database of information which investors can use to research the background of potential advisers. The IARD streamlines the registration process and ensures a more efficient regulatory oversight by aggregating data in one centralized system.

## Conclusion

The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 is a pivotal piece of legislation that continues to shape the investment advisory [industry](../i/industry.md) in the United States. By imposing registration requirements, fiduciary duties, and strict compliance standards, the Act aims to ensure that advisers act in the best interests of their clients, thereby fostering a trustworthy financial environment.

The evolving landscape of financial technology and the global [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) [will](../w/will.md) inevitably bring new challenges; however, the core principles of [investor](../i/investor.md) protection and honesty envisaged by the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 are likely to remain fundamental to future regulatory developments.

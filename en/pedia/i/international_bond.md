# International Bond

An international [bond](../b/bond.md) is a [debt security](../d/debt_security.md) issued in a [capital](../c/capital.md) [market](../m/market.md) not domiciled within the [issuer](../i/issuer.md)’s country. These bonds are used by governments, corporations, and multinational institutions to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) in overseas markets. The venue for the issuance and the [currency](../c/currency.md) in which it is denominated differentiates international bonds. This document delves into various aspects of international bonds, including their definitions, types, features, advantages, risks, and real-world applications.

## Definition and Overview

International bonds are a subset of the larger [bond market](../b/bond_market.md) where issuers seek to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) outside their [home](../h/home.md) country. These bonds are typically aimed at investors who are foreign to the [issuer](../i/issuer.md)'s [home](../h/home.md) [market](../m/market.md). The primary reasons for issuing in a foreign [market](../m/market.md) include [capital](../c/capital.md) [diversification](../d/diversification.md), lower [interest](../i/interest.md) costs, and tapping into new pools of [capital](../c/capital.md). 

### Key Characteristics

1. **[Currency](../c/currency.md) [Denomination](../d/denomination.md)**: International bonds are issued in various currencies. This can either be the [currency](../c/currency.md) of the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) or the [currency](../c/currency.md) of the foreign [market](../m/market.md) in which the [bond](../b/bond.md) is sold.
2. **Regulation and Compliance**: These bonds must adhere to the legal and regulatory frameworks of the foreign [market](../m/market.md).
3. **[Market](../m/market.md) Reach**: Issuers access a broader [investor](../i/investor.md) base, often integrating into emerging and developed markets alike.

## Types of International Bonds

International bonds can be broadly categorized into several types based on issuance and trading locations:

1. **[Eurobond](../e/eurobond.md)**: These are bonds issued in a [currency](../c/currency.md) not native to the country where it is issued. They are typically issued and traded internationally, not restrained to specific countries. For example, a [Eurodollar](../e/eurodollar.md) [bond](../b/bond.md) is issued in U.S. dollars outside the United States.
   
   - *example*: An American [corporation](../c/corporation.md) issues a [bond](../b/bond.md) denominated in euros in Paris.

2. **Foreign [Bond](../b/bond.md)**: Bonds issued in a foreign country by a single entity or [corporation](../c/corporation.md) in that foreign country's [currency](../c/currency.md). Some common terminologies are:
    - **[Yankee Bond](../y/yankee_bond.md)**: Issued in the U.S. by foreign entities.
    - **[Samurai Bond](../s/samurai_bond.md)**: Issued in Japan by non-Japanese companies.
    - **Bulldog [Bond](../b/bond.md)**: Issued in the U.K. by non-British entities.

3. **[Global Bond](../g/global_bond.md)**: These bonds are similar to Eurobonds but are tradeable in [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) around the world. They are suitable for major [market](../m/market.md) players who require high [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).

## Features of International Bonds

1. **[Credit Rating](../c/credit_rating.md)**: The [credit](../c/credit.md) quality of an [issuer](../i/issuer.md) is assessed by [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) agencies such as Moody’s, S&P, and Fitch. High ratings denote low [risk](../r/risk.md) and vice versa.
2. **[Interest](../i/interest.md) Rates**: The [interest](../i/interest.md) rates on international bonds could be fixed or floating, and they heavily rely on the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) rates of the [currency](../c/currency.md) they are issued in.
3. **[Maturity](../m/maturity.md)**: Bonds have varying maturities, from short-term (a few months) to long-term (over 30 years).

## Advantages of International Bonds

1. **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: Investors can diversify their portfolios across different regions and currencies.
2. **[Yield](../y/yield.md) Opportunities**: Higher yields might be possible due to [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) differentials between countries.
3. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Helps in managing [currency](../c/currency.md) [risk](../r/risk.md) if strategically chosen. 

## Risks Involved

1. **[Currency](../c/currency.md) [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: The [value](../v/value.md) of the [bond](../b/bond.md) can fluctuate with changes in the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates between the [home](../h/home.md) and foreign [currency](../c/currency.md).
2. **[Political Risk](../p/political_risk.md)**: Changes in political environments can affect the profitability and [solvency](../s/solvency.md) of the [issuer](../i/issuer.md).
3. **[Credit Risk](../c/credit_risk.md)**: Risks associated with the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) defaulting on repayments due to financial instability.
4. **[Interest Rate Risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md)**: Global [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) changes can impact the [bond](../b/bond.md)’s attractiveness.

## Real-world Application

### Examples of Prominent International Bonds and Issuers

1. **The [World Bank](../w/world_bank.md)**: The [World Bank](../w/world_bank.md) regularly issues bonds to [fund](../f/fund.md) developmental projects around the globe. These bonds are [market](../m/market.md)-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) and often highly rated. [Link](https://www.worldbank.org)

2. **Apple Inc.**: Apple has been known to [issue](../i/issue.md) Eurobonds as a means to [finance](../f/finance.md) its operations at beneficial [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. [Link](https://www.apple.com)

3. **Toyota Motor [Corporation](../c/corporation.md)**: Regularly utilizes Samurai bonds to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) in Japan's markets. [Link](https://www.toyota-global.com)

1. **Emerging Markets**: Corporations from developed nations often [issue](../i/issue.md) bonds in emerging markets to benefit from higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and growth prospects.
2. **Funding and Operations**: Companies with global operations might [issue](../i/issue.md) bonds in various currencies to match their [revenue](../r/revenue.md) streams or funding needs.

# International Bond

An international bond is a debt security issued in a capital market not domiciled within the issuer’s country. These bonds are used by governments, corporations, and multinational institutions to raise capital in overseas markets. The venue for the issuance and the currency in which it is denominated differentiates international bonds. This document delves into various aspects of international bonds, including their definitions, types, features, advantages, risks, and real-world applications.

## Definition and Overview

International bonds are a subset of the larger bond market where issuers seek to raise capital outside their home country. These bonds are typically aimed at investors who are foreign to the issuer's home market. The primary reasons for issuing in a foreign market include capital diversification, lower interest costs, and tapping into new pools of capital. 

### Key Characteristics

1. **Currency Denomination**: International bonds are issued in various currencies. This can either be the currency of the issuer or the currency of the foreign market in which the bond is sold.
2. **Regulation and Compliance**: These bonds must adhere to the legal and regulatory frameworks of the foreign market.
3. **Market Reach**: Issuers access a broader investor base, often integrating into emerging and developed markets alike.

## Types of International Bonds

International bonds can be broadly categorized into several types based on issuance and trading locations:

1. **Eurobond**: These are bonds issued in a currency not native to the country where it is issued. They are typically issued and traded internationally, not restrained to specific countries. For example, a Eurodollar bond is issued in U.S. dollars outside the United States.
   
   - *example*: An American corporation issues a bond denominated in euros in Paris.

2. **Foreign Bond**: Bonds issued in a foreign country by a single entity or corporation in that foreign country's currency. Some common terminologies are:
    - **Yankee Bond**: Issued in the U.S. by foreign entities.
    - **Samurai Bond**: Issued in Japan by non-Japanese companies.
    - **Bulldog Bond**: Issued in the U.K. by non-British entities.

3. **Global Bond**: These bonds are similar to Eurobonds but are tradeable in multiple financial markets around the world. They are suitable for major market players who require high liquidity.

## Features of International Bonds

1. **Credit Rating**: The credit quality of an issuer is assessed by credit rating agencies such as Moody’s, S&P, and Fitch. High ratings denote low risk and vice versa.
2. **Interest Rates**: The interest rates on international bonds could be fixed or floating, and they heavily rely on the benchmark interest rates of the currency they are issued in.
3. **Maturity**: Bonds have varying maturities, from short-term (a few months) to long-term (over 30 years).

## Advantages of International Bonds

1. **Diversification**: Investors can diversify their portfolios across different regions and currencies.
2. **Yield Opportunities**: Higher yields might be possible due to interest rate differentials between countries.
3. **Risk Management**: Helps in managing currency risk if strategically chosen. 

## Risks Involved

1. **Currency Risk**: The value of the bond can fluctuate with changes in the exchange rates between the home and foreign currency.
2. **Political Risk**: Changes in political environments can affect the profitability and solvency of the issuer.
3. **Credit Risk**: Risks associated with the issuer defaulting on repayments due to financial instability.
4. **Interest Rate Risk**: Global interest rate changes can impact the bond’s attractiveness.

# Intraday Gap Trading

Intraday gap trading is a common strategy used by traders to take advantage of price differences between a [security](../s/security.md)'s closing price on the previous day and its [opening price](../o/opening_price.md) on the current trading day. This phenomenon is known as a "gap," and it can occur in either direction—upwards or downwards. The primary objective of an intraday gap [trader](../t/trader.md) is to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on these [gaps](../g/gap.md) by entering trades at the beginning of the trading day and closing them by the end of the session, hence the term "intraday."

## Types of Gaps

### 1. Common Gaps
Common [gaps](../g/gap.md), also known as trading [gaps](../g/gap.md), are usually insignificant and are often filled quickly. They occur in the context of normal [market](../m/market.md) [noise](../n/noise.md) and do not indicate a major shift in [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md).

### 2. Breakaway Gaps
Breakaway [gaps](../g/gap.md) occur when the price [gaps](../g/gap.md) away from a [consolidation](../c/consolidation.md) area, indicating a strong shift in [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md). These [gaps](../g/gap.md) usually signify the beginning of a new [trend](../t/trend.md) and are often followed by significant trading [volume](../v/volume.md).

### 3. Runaway Gaps
[Runaway gaps](../r/runaway_gaps.md), also known as continuation [gaps](../g/gap.md), happen in the middle of a price move and suggest strong conviction in the ongoing [trend](../t/trend.md). These [gaps](../g/gap.md) often indicate that the [trend](../t/trend.md) [will](../w/will.md) continue for some time.

### 4. Exhaustion Gaps
Exhaustion [gaps](../g/gap.md) occur near the end of a significant [trend](../t/trend.md) and indicate that the [trend](../t/trend.md) is losing [momentum](../m/momentum.md). These [gaps](../g/gap.md) can be a precursor to a [trend reversal](../t/trend_reversal.md) or at the very least, a significant [pullback](../p/pullback.md).

## Key Concepts in Intraday Gap Trading

### 1. Gap Fill
A "gap fill" occurs when the price moves back to the previous day's closing price after [gapping](../g/gapping.md) up or down at the [open](../o/open.md). This is a common phenomenon and many intraday gap [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) are based on the expectation that [gaps](../g/gap.md) [will](../w/will.md) fill.

### 2. Volume Analysis
[Volume](../v/volume.md) plays a crucial role in validating the significance of a gap. Higher [volume](../v/volume.md) often indicates that the gap is meaningful and may lead to substantial price movement.

### 3. Support and Resistance Levels
[Gaps](../g/gap.md) often act as support or resistance levels. A gap up can serve as a new support level, while a gap down can act as a resistance level.

### 4. Market Sentiment
Understanding the broader [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) can help in determining the likelihood of a gap continuing in the direction of the gap or filling quickly.

## Strategies for Intraday Gap Trading

### 1. Fade the Gap
The "fade the gap" strategy involves taking a position opposite to the direction of the gap, based on the expectation that the gap [will](../w/will.md) fill. For example, if a stock [gaps](../g/gap.md) up at the [open](../o/open.md), a [trader](../t/trader.md) would short the stock, anticipating that the price [will](../w/will.md) move down to fill the gap.

### 2. Follow the Gap
The "follow the gap" strategy involves taking a position in the direction of the gap. This strategy is based on the expectation that the gap indicates a strong [trend](../t/trend.md) that [will](../w/will.md) continue throughout the day.

### 3. Gap and Go
The "gap and go" strategy involves waiting for confirmation that the gap [will](../w/will.md) continue in the direction of the gap before entering a [trade](../t/trade.md). Traders using this strategy often look for additional [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) to confirm their entry.

### 4. Scalping the Gap
[Scalping](../s/scalping.md) the gap involves taking advantage of small price movements within the gap. Traders using this strategy enter and exit trades quickly, often within minutes.

## Tools and Indicators for Intraday Gap Trading

### 1. Moving Averages
Moving averages can help identify the overall [trend](../t/trend.md) and provide support or resistance levels that may influence the gap.

### 2. RSI (Relative Strength Index)
The RSI can help determine the [momentum](../m/momentum.md) of the price movement and indicate whether the [security](../s/security.md) is [overbought](../o/overbought.md) or [oversold](../o/oversold.md).

### 3. Bollinger Bands
[Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md) can help identify [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and potential breakouts that may coincide with gap movements.

### 4. Volume Indicators
[Volume indicators](../v/volume_indicators.md) like On-Balance [Volume](../v/volume.md) (OBV) and the [Volume](../v/volume.md)-[Weighted Average](../w/weighted_average.md) Price (VWAP) can provide insights into the strength of the gap.

## Risk Management in Intraday Gap Trading

### 1. Stop-Loss Orders
Using [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md) is essential to prevent significant losses. Placing a [stop-loss order](../s/stop-loss_order.md) at a predefined level helps manage [risk](../r/risk.md) effectively.

### 2. Position Sizing
Proper [position sizing](../p/position_sizing.md) ensures that a single adverse move does not wipe out a significant portion of the [trading account](../t/trading_account.md).

### 3. Diversification
Diversifying across different securities and sectors can help mitigate the risks associated with intraday gap trading.

### 4. Risk-Reward Ratio
Maintaining a favorable [risk](../r/risk.md)-reward ratio is crucial for long-term success. Traders should aim for a [risk](../r/risk.md)-reward ratio of at least 1:2.

# Intraday Gap Trading

Intraday gap trading is a common strategy used by traders to take advantage of price differences between a security's closing price on the previous day and its opening price on the current trading day. This phenomenon is known as a "gap," and it can occur in either direction—upwards or downwards. The primary objective of an intraday gap trader is to capitalize on these gaps by entering trades at the beginning of the trading day and closing them by the end of the session, hence the term "intraday."

## Types of Gaps

### 1. Common Gaps
Common gaps, also known as trading gaps, are usually insignificant and are often filled quickly. They occur in the context of normal market noise and do not indicate a major shift in market sentiment.

### 2. Breakaway Gaps
Breakaway gaps occur when the price gaps away from a consolidation area, indicating a strong shift in market sentiment. These gaps usually signify the beginning of a new trend and are often followed by significant trading volume.

### 3. Runaway Gaps
[Runaway gaps](../r/runaway_gaps.md), also known as continuation gaps, happen in the middle of a price move and suggest strong conviction in the ongoing trend. These gaps often indicate that the trend will continue for some time.

### 4. Exhaustion Gaps
Exhaustion gaps occur near the end of a significant trend and indicate that the trend is losing momentum. These gaps can be a precursor to a [trend reversal](../t/trend_reversal.md) or at the very least, a significant pullback.

## Key Concepts in Intraday Gap Trading

### 1. Gap Fill
A "gap fill" occurs when the price moves back to the previous day's closing price after gapping up or down at the open. This is a common phenomenon and many intraday gap [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) are based on the expectation that gaps will fill.

### 2. Volume Analysis
Volume plays a crucial role in validating the significance of a gap. Higher volume often indicates that the gap is meaningful and may lead to substantial price movement.

### 3. Support and Resistance Levels
Gaps often act as support or resistance levels. A gap up can serve as a new support level, while a gap down can act as a resistance level.

### 4. Market Sentiment
Understanding the broader market sentiment can help in determining the likelihood of a gap continuing in the direction of the gap or filling quickly.

## Strategies for Intraday Gap Trading

### 1. Fade the Gap
The "fade the gap" strategy involves taking a position opposite to the direction of the gap, based on the expectation that the gap will fill. For example, if a stock gaps up at the open, a trader would short the stock, anticipating that the price will move down to fill the gap.

### 2. Follow the Gap
The "follow the gap" strategy involves taking a position in the direction of the gap. This strategy is based on the expectation that the gap indicates a strong trend that will continue throughout the day.

### 3. Gap and Go
The "gap and go" strategy involves waiting for confirmation that the gap will continue in the direction of the gap before entering a trade. Traders using this strategy often look for additional [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) to confirm their entry.

### 4. Scalping the Gap
Scalping the gap involves taking advantage of small price movements within the gap. Traders using this strategy enter and exit trades quickly, often within minutes.

## Tools and Indicators for Intraday Gap Trading

### 1. Moving Averages
Moving averages can help identify the overall trend and provide support or resistance levels that may influence the gap.

### 2. RSI (Relative Strength Index)
The RSI can help determine the momentum of the price movement and indicate whether the security is overbought or oversold.

### 3. Bollinger Bands
[Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md) can help identify volatility and potential breakouts that may coincide with gap movements.

### 4. Volume Indicators
[Volume indicators](../v/volume_indicators.md) like On-Balance Volume (OBV) and the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) can provide insights into the strength of the gap.

## Risk Management in Intraday Gap Trading

### 1. Stop-Loss Orders
Using [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md) is essential to prevent significant losses. Placing a stop-loss order at a predefined level helps manage risk effectively.

### 2. Position Sizing
Proper [position sizing](../p/position_sizing.md) ensures that a single adverse move does not wipe out a significant portion of the trading account.

### 3. Diversification
Diversifying across different securities and sectors can help mitigate the risks associated with intraday gap trading.

### 4. Risk-Reward Ratio
Maintaining a favorable risk-reward ratio is crucial for long-term success. Traders should aim for a risk-reward ratio of at least 1:2.

# Incorporation

## Definition
**Incorporation** is the legal process by which a [business](../b/business.md) entity is formed and recognized as a [corporation](../c/corporation.md) by a governmental authority. This process grants the [corporation](../c/corporation.md) a separate legal identity from its owners, providing it with certain legal rights and protections.

## Key Components
1. **Separate Legal Entity**: A [corporation](../c/corporation.md) is recognized as a separate legal entity from its owners (shareholders), with its own rights and [obligations](../o/obligation.md).
2. **[Limited Liability](../l/limited_liability.md)**: Shareholders have [limited liability](../l/limited_liability.md), meaning they are not personally responsible for the [corporation](../c/corporation.md)'s debts and liabilities beyond their investment in the [corporation](../c/corporation.md).
3. **Perpetual Existence**: A [corporation](../c/corporation.md) can continue to exist independently of the lives of its shareholders or directors.
4. **Ownership and Transferability**: Ownership is divided into [shares](../s/shares.md), which can be bought, sold, or transferred.

## Importance
1. **Legal Protection**: Incorporation provides legal protection to the owners by limiting their personal [liability](../l/liability.md) for [business](../b/business.md) debts and [obligations](../o/obligation.md).
2. **[Capital](../c/capital.md) Raising**: Corporations can raise [capital](../c/capital.md) more easily through the [sale](../s/sale.md) of [stocks](../s/stock.md) and bonds.

## Process

## Types of Corporations

# International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)

International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are a set of [accounting](../a/accounting.md) standards developed by the International [Accounting](../a/accounting.md) Standards Board (IASB) that are becoming the global standard for the preparation of [public company](../p/public_company.md) [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md). The goal of IFRS is to provide a global framework for how public companies prepare and disclose their [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md). By adopting these standards, businesses and investors around the globe are provided with a cohesive, transparent, and comparable framework for financial reporting.

## Overview

IFRS were established to create a standard that brings [transparency](../t/transparency.md), accountability, and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) to [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) around the world. This ensures that companies' [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) are understandable and comparable across international boundaries. IFRS has been adopted by more than 140 countries, including the [European Union](../e/european_union_(eu).md), making it a major influence on the world [economy](../e/economy.md).

## History and Development

The IFRS Foundation, an independent, not-for-[profit](../p/profit.md) organization, oversees the development and promotion of International Financial Reporting Standards through the IASB. The IFRS Foundation was established in 2001, succeeding the International [Accounting](../a/accounting.md) Standards Committee (IASC), which had been setting international standards since 1973.

The IFRS Foundation's structure includes the following key bodies:
- The Trustees: responsible for governance and oversight.
- The Monitoring Board: provides public accountability.
- The IASB: responsible for IFRS development.
- The IFRS Advisory Council: advises the IFRS Foundation and IASB.
- The IFRS Interpretations Committee: provides timely [guidance](../g/guidance.md) on [accounting](../a/accounting.md) standards.

## Key Characteristics of IFRS

1. **[Transparency](../t/transparency.md):** IFRS aims to enhance the international comparability and quality of financial information, enabling investors and other [market](../m/market.md) participants to make well-informed economic decisions.

2. **Comprehensiveness:** IFRS covers a broad [range](../r/range.md) of [accounting](../a/accounting.md) topics, ranging from the treatment of assets and liabilities to [revenue recognition](../r/revenue_recognition.md) and financial instruments.

3. **Global Use and Applicability:** IFRS is designed to be universally applicable, adaptable to both large, multinational companies and countries with varying levels of economic development.

4. **Continual Improvement:** The IASB regularly updates and revises IFRS to address emerging financial reporting issues and ensure that standards reflect current practices.

## Major Components of IFRS

### Financial Position

The statement of financial position, commonly known as the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md), provides a snapshot at a particular point in time of an entity's assets, liabilities, and [equity](../e/equity.md). Key IFRS standards related to financial position include:

- **IAS 1 (Presentation of [Financial Statements](../f/financial_statements.md)):** Sets the overall requirements for [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md), guidelines for their structure, and minimum requirements for content.
- **IAS 16 (Property, Plant, and Equipment):** Prescribes the [accounting](../a/accounting.md) treatment for most types of property, plant, and equipment.
- **IAS 36 ([Impairment](../i/impairment.md) of Assets):** Ensures that assets are carried at no more than their recoverable amount.

### Comprehensive Income

The statement of [comprehensive income](../c/comprehensive_income.md) shows the entity’s [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) over a specified period of time. This includes both [profit](../p/profit.md) and loss and other [comprehensive income](../c/comprehensive_income.md). Related IFRS standards include:

- **IAS 1 (Presentation of [Financial Statements](../f/financial_statements.md)):** As above, it sets the presentation requirements for [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md).
- **IFRS 15 ([Revenue](../r/revenue.md) from Contracts with Customers):** Specifies how and when an entity [will](../w/will.md) recognize [revenue](../r/revenue.md) and requires entities to provide users of [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) with more informative disclosures.

### Cash Flows

The statement of cash flows provides information about the changes in an entity’s [financial structure](../f/financial_structure.md) and its ability to generate cash and [cash equivalents](../c/cash_equivalents.md). Related standards include:
- **IAS 7 (Statement of Cash Flows):** Requires entities to present information about historical changes in cash and [cash equivalents](../c/cash_equivalents.md) through a [cash flow statement](../c/cash_flow_statement.md).

### Changes in Equity

This statement provides details about the entity’s [equity](../e/equity.md) changes during the reporting period. It's essential for users to understand movements in the [equity](../e/equity.md) components, including share [capital](../c/capital.md), [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md), and other reserves.

### Disclosure Notes

[Disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) notes provide additional information that is essential for a complete understanding of the [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md). They often include details on [accounting policies](../a/accounting_policies.md), critical estimates, and judgments.

## Adoption and Implementation

The adoption of IFRS is often a complex and time-consuming process that typically involves significant changes in [accounting policies](../a/accounting_policies.md), systems, and procedures. Countries adopt IFRS in different ways:

- **Full Adoption:** Countries like the member states of the [European Union](../e/european_union_(eu).md) have fully adopted IFRS for all [listed](../l/listed.md) companies.
- **Convergence:** Countries like India and China have converged national standards with IFRS, meaning their local standards closely align with IFRS but are not identical.
- **Optional Adoption:** Some countries allow companies the option to use either national standards or IFRS.

### Challenges in Implementation

Implementing IFRS involves significant challenges, such as:

- **Training and Education:** Ensuring that [finance](../f/finance.md) professionals are adequately trained and understand the new standards.
- **System Modifications:** Updating [accounting](../a/accounting.md) systems and processes to comply with IFRS requirements.
- **Regulatory Differences:** Managing the differences between local regulatory requirements and IFRS standards.

## Benefits of IFRS

### Enhanced Comparability

One of the primary benefits of IFRS is enhanced comparability between [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) of companies globally. Investors can compare the [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) and position of companies from different countries more easily.

### Improved Transparency

IFRS provide higher quality and more transparent financial reporting standards, improving investors' ability to make informed decisions by giving them a clear view of the [business](../b/business.md)'s [financial health](../f/financial_health.md).

### Increased Investment

With improved [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and comparability, IFRS can lead to increased cross-border investment. Investors are more likely to invest in foreign companies if they [trust](../t/trust.md) and understand their [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md).

### Cost Efficiency

For multinational companies, adopting IFRS can be more cost-effective compared to maintaining [multiple](../m/multiple.md) sets of books for different national standards. It can streamline financial reporting and reduce the complexity and cost of compliance.

## Criticisms of IFRS

While IFRS offers many benefits, there are criticisms as well:

### Complexity

IFRS can be complex and challenging to adopt, especially for smaller businesses. The cost and complexity of implementing IFRS can be a significant barrier.

### Judgment and Estimates

IFRS often requires significant use of management [judgment](../j/judgment.md) and estimates, which can lead to inconsistent application and potentially reduce comparability.

### Cultural and Economic Differences

IFRS may not always consider the cultural and economic differences across countries. Applying a single set of standards globally can be challenging for countries with diverse economic environments.

## Relationship with US GAAP

The primary alternative to IFRS is the Generally Accepted [Accounting Principles](../a/accounting_principles.md) (GAAP) in the United States. While both sets of standards aim to improve financial reporting, significant differences exist between them. Efforts have been made to converge the two sets of standards, but they remain distinct in many areas.

### Key Differences

- **[Revenue Recognition](../r/revenue_recognition.md):** While IFRS and US GAAP have both adopted new standards for [revenue recognition](../r/revenue_recognition.md), differences in application and interpretation remain.
- **[Inventory](../i/inventory.md) Costs:** IFRS prohibits the use of the [Last In, First Out (LIFO) method](../l/last_in_first_out_(lifo)_method.md), while US GAAP allows it.
- **Development Costs:** IFRS requires [capitalization](../c/capitalization.md) of development costs when certain criteria are met, whereas US GAAP usually expenses most development costs as incurred.

### Ongoing Convergence Efforts

There have been ongoing efforts to converge IFRS and US GAAP to further enhance global financial reporting consistency. The Norwalk Agreement in 2002 was a significant step in the collaboration between the IASB and the [Financial Accounting](../f/financial_accounting.md) Standards Board (FASB), the US [accounting](../a/accounting.md) standards setter.

## Future of IFRS

As [globalization](../g/globalization.md) continues to advance, the future of IFRS looks promising, with more countries expected to adopt or converge with international standards. The IASB is committed to ensuring that IFRS evolves to meet the needs of the global [economy](../e/economy.md), embracing new areas such as digital currencies and sustainability reporting.

### Technological Advancements

Technological advancements such as [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md), [artificial intelligence](../a/artificial_intelligence_in_trading.md), and [big data](../b/big_data_in_trading.md) are likely to impact financial reporting significantly. The IASB and IFRS Foundation are exploring these developments to ensure future standards remain relevant and effective.

### Sustainability Reporting

There is a growing [demand](../d/demand.md) for sustainability and environmental reporting. The IFRS Foundation has launched an initiative to create a new standard-setting board for sustainability disclosures, recognizing the importance of integrating financial and non-financial information.

## Conclusion

International Financial Reporting Standards have become a cornerstone of global financial reporting. By enhancing [transparency](../t/transparency.md), comparability, and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md), IFRS plays a critical role in the global [economy](../e/economy.md), facilitating cross-border investments and [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md). Despite challenges and criticisms, the ongoing development and adoption of IFRS [will](../w/will.md) likely continue to shape the future of financial reporting.

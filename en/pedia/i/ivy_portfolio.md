# Ivy Portfolio

The Ivy Portfolio, often referred to as the "endowment model," is an investment strategy inspired by the [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) models used by the Harvard and Yale university endowments. This strategy aims to achieve strong long-term returns while minimizing risk through diversification across various asset classes. Below, we'll delve into the origins, principles, [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md), implementation, and key figures associated with the Ivy Portfolio.

## Origins of the Ivy Portfolio

The Ivy Portfolio approach was popularized by Mebane T. Faber and Eric W. Richardson in their 2009 book, "The Ivy Portfolio: How to Invest Like the Top Endowments and Avoid Bear Markets." The strategy draws on the principles employed by leading university endowments, particularly those managed by David Swensen at Yale and Jack Meyer at Harvard. These endowments are known for delivering exceptional long-term performance by diversifying investments across a broad range of asset classes.

## Principles of the Ivy Portfolio

The Ivy Portfolio is built on several core principles that are essential for achieving its goals of high returns and low risk:

1. **Diversification Across Multiple Asset Classes**:
   - Traditional asset classes like stocks and bonds are complemented by alternative investments, such as real estate, commodities, and hedge funds.
   - This broad diversification reduces risk and enhances the potential for returns.

2. **Long-Term Investment Horizon**:
   - The strategy emphasizes a long-term outlook, which aligns with the investment horizons of large endowments.
   - This perspective helps investors weather short-term market volatility and benefit from compounding returns over time.

3. **Strategic [Asset Allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md)**:
   - The [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) is carefully designed to balance risk and return.
   - The mix of assets is periodically reviewed and adjusted based on changing market conditions and long-term investment goals.

4. **Active Management and Tactical Shifts**:
   - While the overall strategy is long-term, tactical adjustments may be made to exploit market opportunities or mitigate risks.
   - This active management component can help enhance returns and protect the portfolio during market downturns.

## Asset Allocation in the Ivy Portfolio

The Ivy Portfolio typically includes a diversified mix of traditional and alternative asset classes. The exact allocation can vary, but a common model might consist of:

1. **Domestic Equities (20%)**:
   - Representing U.S. stocks, this component aims to capture the growth potential of large and small-cap companies.

2. **International Equities (20%)**:
   - Diversifying globally, this allocation includes developed and emerging market stocks, enhancing the portfolio's growth potential and reducing home-country bias.

3. **Real Estate (20%)**:
   - Investments in real estate, such as REITs, provide income and potential appreciation while serving as a hedge against inflation.

4. **Commodities (20%)**:
   - Commodities like gold, oil, and agricultural products offer diversification and can act as a hedge against economic uncertainties and inflation.

5. **Fixed Income (20%)**:
   - Bonds and other fixed-income securities provide stability and income, balancing the portfolio's overall risk.

### Alternative Allocations

Some iterations of the Ivy Portfolio may include other asset classes or adjust the percentages to reflect individual preferences and market conditions. For example:

- **Private Equity**: Including venture capital and buyout funds.
- **Hedge Funds**: Offering potential for high returns and risk mitigation through various strategies.
- **Natural Resources**: Investments in timber, farmland, and energy resources.

## Implementing the Ivy Portfolio

Implementing the Ivy Portfolio strategy involves several steps:

1. **Setting Investment Goals**:
   - Clearly define your long-term investment objectives, risk tolerance, and time horizon.
   - These factors will guide your [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) decisions.

2. **Choosing Investment Vehicles**:
   - Select appropriate investment vehicles for each asset class, such as mutual funds, ETFs, or direct investments.
   - Ensure that the chosen vehicles align with your goals and offer diversification and cost-efficiency.

3. **Periodic Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review your portfolio to ensure it remains aligned with your [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) targets.
   - Rebalance periodically to maintain the desired mix of assets and mitigate risk.

4. **Staying Informed**:
   - Keep abreast of market developments, economic trends, and changes in the investment landscape.
   - Monitor the performance of your portfolio and make informed adjustments as needed.

# Ichimoku Cloud

The Ichimoku Cloud, also known as Ichimoku Kinko Hyo, is a comprehensive trading [indicator](../i/indicator.md) that defines [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels, identifies [trend](../t/trend.md) direction, gauges [momentum](../m/momentum.md), and provides [trading signals](../t/trading_signals.md). It is one of the more versatile and visually intriguing tools available to traders. Developed by Japanese journalist Goichi Hosoda in the late 1960s, the Ichimoku Cloud consists of five main components that together [offer](../o/offer.md) a holistic view of the [market](../m/market.md).

### Key Components

1. **Tenkan-sen (Conversion Line):** The average of the highest high and the lowest low over the last 9 periods. It typically serves as an [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of short-term price trends.
   
2. **Kijun-sen (Base Line):** The average of the highest high and the lowest low over the last 26 periods. It acts as an [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of medium-term trends.
   
3. **Senkou Span A (Leading Span A):** The average of the Tenkan-sen and the Kijun-sen plotted 26 periods into the future. This line, along with Senkou Span B, forms the Ichimoku Cloud.
   
4. **Senkou Span B (Leading Span B):** The average of the highest high and the lowest low over the past 52 periods, plotted 26 periods into the future.
   
5. **Chikou Span (Lagging Span):** The closing price plotted 26 periods into the past. This helps to confirm trends and potential reversals.

### The Cloud (Kumo)

The area between Senkou Span A and Senkou Span B is called the Kumo or the Cloud. This region helps in identifying [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) zones. When the price is above the cloud, it is considered to be in an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md). Conversely, when the price is below the cloud, it is indicative of a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md). The cloud's thickness can also indicate the strength or weakness of a [trend](../t/trend.md). A thicker cloud suggests a stronger [trend](../t/trend.md), providing more [robust](../r/robust.md) support or resistance.

### Trading Signals

The Ichimoku Cloud generates several types of [trading signals](../t/trading_signals.md):

1. **Tenkan-sen/Kijun-sen Crossover:** 
   - A bullish signal occurs when the Tenkan-sen crosses above the Kijun-sen.
   - A bearish signal occurs when the Tenkan-sen crosses below the Kijun-sen.

2. **Price/Cloud Relationship:**
   - Price above the cloud suggests a bullish [trend](../t/trend.md).
   - Price below the cloud suggests a bearish [trend](../t/trend.md).
   
3. **Chikou Span Confirmation:**
   - If the Chikou Span is above the price, it confirms a bullish [trend](../t/trend.md).
   - If the Chikou Span is below the price, it confirms a bearish [trend](../t/trend.md).
   
4. **Cloud Color:**
   - The cloud changes color based on the position of Senkou Spans A and B. A green cloud forms when Span A is above Span B, signaling an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md). Conversely, a red cloud forms when Span B is above Span A, signaling a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md).

### Practical Applications

The Ichimoku Cloud is widely used in [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), including forex, equities, and commodities. Its ability to provide clear signals in trending markets makes it particularly useful for traders who prefer to follow medium to long-term trends.

### Advantages

- **Holistic View:** The [indicator](../i/indicator.md) offers a comprehensive view of the [market](../m/market.md), combining elements of [trend](../t/trend.md) identification, support/resistance levels, and [momentum](../m/momentum.md) assessment.
- **Versatile:** It can be applied across different timeframes and [asset](../a/asset.md) classes.
- **Clear Signals:** The visual nature of the cloud and the crossover signals provide clear entry and exit points.

### Disadvantages

- **Complexity:** The [indicator](../i/indicator.md) can appear complex to new traders due to its [multiple](../m/multiple.md) components and the cloud structure.
- **Lagging Nature:** Like most [trend](../t/trend.md)-following indicators, the Ichimoku Cloud can produce lagging signals, which might result in delayed entries or exits in rapidly changing markets.

### Conclusion

The Ichimoku Cloud is a powerful and versatile trading tool that offers a wide [range](../r/range.md) of information about [market](../m/market.md) conditions. Its comprehensive nature allows traders to identify trends, [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels, and [momentum](../m/momentum.md) in a single glance, making it a valuable addition to any [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md). However, like all indicators, it is not infallible and should ideally be used in conjunction with other analysis tools to confirm signals and improve trading decisions.

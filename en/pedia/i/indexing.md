# Indexing

## Introduction to Indexing

**Indexing** is a statistical measure that represents a specific portfolio of securities or other financial instruments. This collection of securities is often designed to replicate the performance of an entire [market](../m/market.md) or a large segment of it. Indexing is widely used in both [economics](../e/economics.md) and [investing](../i/investing.md) as a means of benchmarking performance, diversifying [risk](../r/risk.md), and simplifying investment strategies.

## Types of Indices

Indices can be categorized based on the [asset class](../a/asset_class.md) they represent, the geographical region, or even the specific sector within an [industry](../i/industry.md). Some of the most common types include:

### Stock Market Indices

[Stock market](../s/stock_market.md) indices compile the performance of a group of [stocks](../s/stock.md) and are often used to represent the overall performance of the [stock market](../s/stock_market.md). Examples include:

- **S&P 500**: Comprises 500 of the largest companies [listed](../l/listed.md) on stock exchanges in the United States.
- **Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)**: Consists of 30 significant companies traded on the NYSE and [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md).
- **[NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md) Composite**: Includes more than 3,000 [stocks](../s/stock.md) [listed](../l/listed.md) on the [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md) stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md).

### Bond Market Indices

[Bond](../b/bond.md) indices measure the performance of various types of bonds, such as:

- **[Bloomberg](../b/bloomberg.md) Barclays US Aggregate [Bond](../b/bond.md) [Index](../i/index.md)**: Tracks a broad spectrum of U.S. investment-grade bonds.
- **ICE [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) 20+ Year [Bond](../b/bond.md) [Index](../i/index.md)**: Focuses on long-term [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) bonds.

### Commodity Indices

[Commodity](../c/commodity.md) indices are designed to measure the performance of specific commodities, examples include:

- **S&P GSCI**: A diversified [commodity](../c/commodity.md) [index](../i/index.md) that includes a broad [range](../r/range.md) of [commodity futures](../c/commodity_futures.md) contracts.
- **[Bloomberg](../b/bloomberg.md) [Commodity](../c/commodity.md) [Index](../i/index.md) (BCOM)**: Tracks the performance of major commodities in the energy, metals, and agriculture sectors.

### Sector-Specific Indices

These indices focus on specific industries or sectors within the [economy](../e/economy.md). Examples are:

- **MSCI World [Energy Sector](../e/energy_sector.md) [Index](../i/index.md)**: Measures the performance of the [energy sector](../e/energy_sector.md) across developed markets worldwide.
- **PHLX Semiconductor Sector [Index](../i/index.md) (SOX)**: Tracks the performance of companies in the semiconductor [industry](../i/industry.md).

## The Concept of Indexing in Investing

### Passive Management

Indexing as an [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) involves constructing a portfolio to match the constituents of a [market index](../m/market_index.md). This approach is often referred to as **passive management**. Unlike [active management](../a/active_management.md), which seeks to [outperform](../o/outperform.md) the [market](../m/market.md) through stock picking and [market timing](../m/market_timing.md), passive management aims to replicate the [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md) profile of the target [index](../i/index.md).

### Index Funds and ETFs

Two common investment vehicles that utilize indexing strategies are **[index](../i/index.md) funds** and **[Exchange](../e/exchange.md)-Traded Funds (ETFs)**.

- **[Index](../i/index.md) Funds**: Mutual funds designed to follow the performance of a specific [index](../i/index.md). They [offer](../o/offer.md) investors a cost-effective way to [gain](../g/gain.md) broad [market exposure](../m/market_exposure.md). Examples include the **Vanguard 500 [Index Fund](../i/index_fund.md)** and the **Fidelity Total [Market Index](../m/market_index.md) [Fund](../f/fund.md)**.

- **ETFs**: Similar to [index](../i/index.md) funds but traded like [stocks](../s/stock.md) on an [exchange](../e/exchange.md). Examples include the **SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY)** and the **[iShares](../i/ishares.md) Russell 2000 ETF (IWM)**.

### Benefits of Indexing

1. **Cost [Efficiency](../e/efficiency.md)**: [Index](../i/index.md) funds and ETFs often have lower [expense](../e/expense.md) ratios compared to actively managed funds.
2. **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: By replicating the performance of an entire [market](../m/market.md) or sector, indexing inherently provides broad [diversification](../d/diversification.md).
3. **[Transparency](../t/transparency.md)**: The composition and [rebalancing rules](../r/rebalancing_rules.md) of indices are publicly available, making the strategy highly transparent.
4. **Consistency**: Passive management strategies reduce the [variability](../v/variability.md) of returns due to human decision-making errors.

### Limitations of Indexing

1. **Lack of Flexibility**: [Index](../i/index.md) funds must adhere strictly to the [index](../i/index.md) composition, which may lead to missed opportunities to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on [market](../m/market.md) inefficiencies.
2. **[Transaction Costs](../t/transaction_costs.md)**: While generally low, [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md) for [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) the portfolio can add up over time.
3. **Sectoral Risks**: If a [market](../m/market.md) or sector underperforms, the [index fund](../i/index_fund.md) [will](../w/will.md) mirror this poor performance.

## Indexing in Economics

### Economic Indicators

Indices serve as leading [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md) that help policymakers and analysts gauge the health of the [economy](../e/economy.md). Examples include:

- **Consumer Price [Index](../i/index.md) (CPI)**: Measures the average change in prices paid by consumers over time for a [basket of goods](../b/basket_of_goods.md) and services. The **Bureau of Labor [Statistics](../s/statistics.md) (BLS)** provides data on CPI [here](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/).

- **Producer Price [Index](../i/index.md) (PPI)**: Measures the average change in selling prices received by domestic producers for their output.

- **Gross Domestic Product (GDP) [Index](../i/index.md)**: Represents the total economic output of a country.

### Inflation Indexing

[Inflation](../i/inflation.md) indexing involves adjusting incomes, benefits, and financial instruments to maintain [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) in the face of [inflation](../i/inflation.md). It's commonly used in:

- **Wage Contracts**: Adjusting wages according to [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rates to ensure workers' [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) remains stable.
- **[Social Security](../s/social_security.md)**: In the U.S., [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) benefits are adjusted annually based on changes in the CPI.
- **[Inflation](../i/inflation.md)-Indexed Bonds**: Bonds in which the [principal](../p/principal.md) and [interest](../i/interest.md) payments are adjusted for [inflation](../i/inflation.md). An example is the Treasury [Inflation-Protected Securities](../i/inflation-protected_securities.md) (TIPS) issued by the [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md).

## Constructing an Index

### Selection Criteria

Indices are constructed based on a set of predefined criteria which may include:

- **[Market Capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md)**: The total [market value](../m/market_value.md) of a companyâ€™s outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md).
- **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)**: The ease with which a [security](../s/security.md) can be bought or sold without affecting its price.
- **Sector Representation**: Inclusion of companies to ensure balanced representation across various sectors.

### Weighting Methods

Indices can be [weighted](../w/weighted.md) in different ways:

- **Price-[Weighted](../w/weighted.md)**: The [index](../i/index.md) [value](../v/value.md) is based on the price of its constituent [stocks](../s/stock.md). An example is the DJIA.
- **[Market](../m/market.md) Cap-[Weighted](../w/weighted.md)**: The [index](../i/index.md) [value](../v/value.md) is based on the [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) of its constituent [stocks](../s/stock.md). Examples include the S&P 500 and the [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md) Composite.
- **Equal-[Weighted](../w/weighted.md)**: Each constituent in the [index](../i/index.md) has the same weight regardless of its size or price.

### Rebalancing

Indices are periodically rebalanced to ensure they reflect current [market](../m/market.md) conditions and adhere to their predefined criteria. [Rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) can occur:

- **Quarterly**: Some indices adjust their components every three months.
- **Annually**: Others may update their components once a year.

## Major Index Providers

Several organizations specialize in creating and maintaining indices, including:

- **S&P Dow Jones Indices**: A division of S&P Global, they [offer](../o/offer.md) a wide [range](../r/range.md) of indices including the S&P 500 and the DJIA. More information can be found [here](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/).
- **MSCI Inc.**: Provides indices covering global [equity](../e/equity.md) markets, including the MSCI World [Index](../i/index.md) and various sector-specific and region-specific indices. More details are available [here](https://www.msci.com/).

## Real-World Applications

### Institutional Investors

Pension funds, endowments, and [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies often use indexing strategies for their investment portfolios to achieve stable, long-term returns. For example, the **California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS)** employs indexing for a substantial portion of its [equity](../e/equity.md) investments. More about their investment strategies can be found on their [website](https://www.calpers.ca.gov/).

### Individual Investors

[Index](../i/index.md) funds and ETFs [offer](../o/offer.md) individual investors an accessible way to diversify their portfolios and achieve [market](../m/market.md)-level returns with lower fees. The rise of robo-advisors, such as **Betterment** and **Wealthfront**, largely relies on ETF-based indexing strategies to provide customized, automated investment portfolios. You can learn more about Betterment [here](https://www.betterment.com/) and Wealthfront [here](https://www.wealthfront.com/).

### Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading strategies](../a/algorithmic_trading_strategies.md) often use indices as benchmarks to optimize buy and sell signals. Strategies may include statistical [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), where traders exploit price discrepancies between an [index](../i/index.md) and related securities. Companies like **[QuantConnect](../q/quantconnect.md)** [offer](../o/offer.md) platforms that enable developers to create and backtest [algorithmic trading strategies](../a/algorithmic_trading_strategies.md) based on indices. More details can be found [here](https://www.quantconnect.com/).

### Risk Management

Indices are also used in the context of [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) through the creation of [index](../i/index.md)-based [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) such as [options](../o/options.md) and [futures](../f/futures.md). These financial instruments allow traders to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against potential [market](../m/market.md) movements. Exchanges like the **Chicago Mercantile [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (CME)** [offer](../o/offer.md) a [range](../r/range.md) of [index futures](../i/index_futures.md). Visit the CME [website](https://www.cmegroup.com/) for more information.

## Conclusion

Indexing is a multifaceted tool with applications that [range](../r/range.md) from benchmarking and passive investment to economic analysis and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md). The advantages of [transparency](../t/transparency.md), cost [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md), and [diversification](../d/diversification.md) make it a popular choice among both institutional and individual investors. While it does have its limitations, the benefits of indexing have made it a cornerstone of modern [portfolio management](../p/par.md) and a vital part of economic measurement.

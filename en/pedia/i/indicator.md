# Indicator

An indicator in algorithmic trading is a mathematical calculation based on historical price, volume, or open interest information that aims to predict future market movements. Indicators are essential tools for technical analysis, and they help traders make more informed decisions by identifying trends, volatility, momentum, and other market characteristics. There are several categories and types of indicators, each serving a specific purpose. This article aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of various indicators and their applications in algorithmic trading.

## Moving Averages

### Simple Moving Average (SMA)
The Simple Moving Average is one of the most commonly used indicators. It calculates the average price over a specified number of periods. The SMA is often used to identify trend direction. For example, a 50-day SMA is the average of the last 50 daysâ€™ closing prices.

```python
def calculate_sma(prices, period):
    return sum(prices[-period:]) / period
```

### Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
The Exponential Moving Average gives more weight to recent prices, making it more responsive to new information. The EMA formula applies a multiplicative factor to the most recent data points.

```python
def calculate_ema(prices, period):
    ema = [sum(prices[:period]) / period]
    multiplier = 2 / (period + 1)
    for price in prices[period:]:
        ema.append(((price - ema[-1]) * multiplier) + ema[-1])
    return ema
```

## Oscillators

### Relative Strength Index (RSI)
The Relative Strength Index is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. The RSI oscillates between 0 and 100 and is typically used to identify overbought or oversold conditions.

```python
def calculate_rsi(prices, period=14):
    deltas = [prices[i+1] - prices[i] for i in range(len(prices)-1)]
    gain = sum([delta for delta in deltas if delta > 0])
    loss = abs(sum([delta for delta in deltas if delta < 0]))
    avg_gain = gain / period
    avg_loss = loss / period
    rs = avg_gain / avg_loss
    return 100 - (100 / (1 + rs))
```

### Stochastic Oscillator
The Stochastic Oscillator compares a particular closing price of a security to a range of its prices over a certain period. It generates two lines, %K and %D, to identify overbought or oversold conditions.

```python
def calculate_stochastic_oscillator(prices, period=14):
    high_low_diff = [max(prices[i-period:i]) - min(prices[i-period:i]) for i in range(period, len(prices))]
    %K = [(prices[i] - min(prices[i-period:i])) / high_low_diff[i-period] * 100 for i in range(period, len(prices))]
    %D = [sum(%K[i-2:i+1]) / 3 for i in range(2, len(%K))]
    return %K, %D
```

## Volume Indicators

### On-Balance Volume (OBV)
The On-Balance Volume indicator uses volume flow to predict changes in stock price. It adds volume on up days and subtracts on down days.

```python
def calculate_obv(prices, volumes):
    obv = [volumes[0]]
    for i in range(1, len(prices)):
        if prices[i] > prices[i-1]:
            obv.append(obv[-1] + volumes[i])
        elif prices[i] < prices[i-1]:
            obv.append(obv[-1] - volumes[i])
        else:
            obv.append(obv[-1])
    return obv
```

### Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
The Volume-Weighted Average Price provides the average price a security has traded at throughout the day, based on both volume and price. It is usually used as a trading benchmark.

```python
def calculate_vwap(prices, volumes):
    cumulative_price_volume = sum([price * volume for price, volume in zip(prices, volumes)])
    cumulative_volume = sum(volumes)
    return cumulative_price_volume / cumulative_volume
```

## Volatility Indicators

### Bollinger Bands
Bollinger Bands consist of a middle band being a moving average and two outer bands calculated as the standard deviations from the moving average. They help to identify volatility and overbought/oversold conditions.

```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_bollinger_bands(prices, period=20):
    sma = np.mean(prices[-period:])
    std_dev = np.std(prices[-period:])
    upper_band = sma + (2 * std_dev)
    lower_band = sma - (2 * std_dev)
    return upper_band, sma, lower_band
```

### Average True Range (ATR)
The Average True Range is a volatility indicator that measures the range within which the price of an asset typically fluctuates. It provides an idea of how much the price is moving during a set period.

```python
def calculate_atr(high, low, close, period=14):
    tr = [max(high[i] - low[i], abs(high[i] - close[i-1]), abs(low[i] - close[i-1])) for i in range(1, len(high))]
    atr = [sum(tr[:period]) / period]
    for i in range(period, len(tr)):
        atr.append((atr[-1] * (period - 1) + tr[i]) / period)
    return atr
```

## Trend Indicators

### Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
The MACD calculates the difference between two exponential moving averages (EMAs), typically a 12-period EMA and a 26-period EMA. A 9-period EMA of the MACD is called the "signal line."

```python
def calculate_macd(prices, fast_period=12, slow_period=26, signal_period=9):
    fast_ema = calculate_ema(prices, fast_period)
    slow_ema = calculate_ema(prices, slow_period)
    macd = [fast - slow for fast, slow in zip(fast_ema, slow_ema)]
    signal_line = calculate_ema(macd, signal_period)
    return macd, signal_line
```

### Parabolic SAR
The Parabolic SAR (Stop and Reverse) is used to determine the direction of an asset's momentum and the point in time when this momentum has a higher-than-normal probability of switching directions.

```python
def calculate_parabolic_sar(high, low, af=0.02, max_af=0.2):
    sar = low[0]  # Start at the first low value
    ep = high[0]  # Highest price (Extreme Point)
    trend = 1  # 1 for uptrend, 0 for downtrend
    sar_list = []

    for i in range(1, len(high)):
        sar_list.append(sar)
        if trend == 1:
            sar = sar + af * (ep - sar)
            if high[i] > ep:
                ep = high[i]
                af = min(af + 0.02, max_af)
            if low[i] < sar:
                trend = 0
                sar = ep
                ep = low[i]
                af = 0.02
        else:
            sar = sar - af * (sar - ep)
            if low[i] < ep:
                ep = low[i]
                af = min(af + 0.02, max_af)
            if high[i] > sar:
                trend = 1
                sar = ep
                ep = high[i]
                af = 0.02

    sar_list.append(sar)
    return sar_list
```

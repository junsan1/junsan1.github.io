# Insolvency

## Introduction 
Insolvency is a state where an individual, [corporation](../c/corporation.md), or other organization can no longer meet their financial [obligations](../o/obligation.md) as debts become due. It is important to differentiate between insolvency and [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md); insolvency is a financial state, while [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) is a legal process that follows when a person or entity declares its inability to repay debts. Insolvency can trigger legal actions and negotiations, including [debt restructuring](../d/debt_restructuring.md), [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md), or [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md).

## Types of Insolvency
There are generally two main types of insolvency: 

### Balance Sheet Insolvency
This occurs when an individual's or company's liabilities exceed their assets. It can be identified by comparing the [value](../v/value.md) of the assets on a [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) to the [value](../v/value.md) of the liabilities.

### Cash Flow Insolvency 
This type of insolvency occurs when the individual or company cannot pay debts as they fall due, even if their assets might exceed liabilities. It can happen due to poor [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), where assets are not readily convertible into cash.

## Causes of Insolvency
Several factors can lead to insolvency:

- **Excessive [Debt](../d/debt.md):** Taking on more [debt](../d/debt.md) than can be managed or serviced.
- **[Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md) Problems:** Inadequate [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) to meet financial [obligations](../o/obligation.md) even if the [business](../b/business.md) is profitable.
- **Economic Downturns:** Adverse [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md) affecting [revenue](../r/revenue.md) and [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md).
- **Operational Inefficiencies:** Poor management decisions or operational inefficiencies leading to excess costs.
- **[Fraud](../f/fraud.md):** Mismanagement or fraudulent activities that deteriorate financial standings.

## Legal Framework and Processes

### Insolvency Laws
Different countries have diverse laws and frameworks governing insolvency. These laws seek to balance the rights of debtors and creditors:

- **United States:** The [Bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) Code governs insolvency processes, [offering](../o/offering.md) various chapters such as Chapter 7 ([liquidation](../l/liquidation.md)), Chapter 11 ([reorganization](../r/reorganization.md)), and Chapter 13 (wage earner's plan).
- **United Kingdom:** Insolvency is governed by the Insolvency Act 1986, which includes procedures like administration, [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md), and voluntary arrangements.
- **[European Union](../e/european_union_(eu).md):** The EU Insolvency Regulation aims to simplify cross-border insolvency cases within member states.

### Insolvency Practitioners
Insolvency practitioners are professionals authorized to act in insolvency cases. They can be accountants or lawyers who manage the insolvency process, including [debt](../d/debt.md) collection, [asset](../a/asset.md) [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md), and negotiating with creditors.

## Insolvency Processes for Companies

### Liquidation
[Liquidation](../l/liquidation.md) involves [winding up](../w/winding_up.md) a company's affairs by selling its assets to pay creditors. It can be:

- **[Voluntary Liquidation](../v/voluntary_liquidation.md):** When the company's directors initiate the process due to insolvency or a decision to cease operations.
- **Compulsory [Liquidation](../l/liquidation.md):** Initiated by creditors through a court [order](../o/order.md) when the company cannot pay its debts.

### Administration
Administration allows a company to continue operations while [restructuring](../r/restructuring.md) and attempting to [return](../r/return.md) to [solvency](../s/solvency.md). An administrator is appointed to manage the company, usually aiming to rescue it or achieve a better [return](../r/return.md) for creditors than immediate [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md).

### Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA)
A CVA is a binding agreement between a company and its creditors to restructure or reduce [debt](../d/debt.md) payments. It requires approval from creditors holding at least 75% of the [debt](../d/debt.md) [value](../v/value.md).

## Insolvency Processes for Individuals

### Bankruptcy
[Bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) is a legal process undertaken when an individual cannot repay their debts. Assets are sold off to pay creditors, and the individual might face restrictions on financial and [business activities](../b/business_activities.md).

### Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)
An IVA is a formal agreement between an individual and creditors to repay a portion of debts over time. It can be a preferable alternative to [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md), helping to avoid severe legal and personal repercussions.

## Effects of Insolvency

### On Debtors
For businesses, insolvency can lead to loss of control over operations, damage to reputation, and potential closure. Individuals face significant financial restrictions, potential loss of assets, and long-term [credit](../c/credit.md) implications.

### On Creditors
Creditors often recover only part of what is owed, facing financial losses. Their approach to recovering debts might involve accepting reduced payments or extended timescales.

### On Employees
Employees may lose their jobs if a company goes insolvent, especially if it leads to [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md). They may also experience delays in receiving wages or benefits owed.

## Strategies to Avoid Insolvency

### Financial Management
Effective financial management, including sound [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) monitoring, budgeting, and [cost control](../c/cost_control.md), can prevent insolvency.

### Debt Restructuring
Negotiating with creditors to restructure current [debt](../d/debt.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md) may provide relief and enable continued operations.

### Diversification
Diversifying products or services can reduce the [risk](../r/risk.md) of [market](../m/market.md) downturns affecting all [revenue](../r/revenue.md) streams.

### Raising Capital
Securing additional [capital](../c/capital.md) through investment, loans, or [credit](../c/credit.md) lines can bolster a company's financial position.

## Case Studies of Insolvency

### Lehman Brothers 
[Lehman Brothers](../l/lehman_brothers.md) declared [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) in September 2008, becoming a central figure in the global [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md). Its insolvency stemmed from high-[risk](../r/risk.md) [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) lending and insufficient [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) to cover [obligations](../o/obligation.md).

### Enron Corporation
Enron filed for [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) in December 2001 after it was revealed that the company engaged in extensive [accounting](../a/accounting.md) [fraud](../f/fraud.md) to hide [debt](../d/debt.md) and inflate profits.

### Toys "R" Us
Toys "R" Us filed for [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) in September 2017, struggling with $5 billion in [debt](../d/debt.md) and competitive pressures from online retailers.

# Ichimoku Kinko Hyo Indicator & Five Components

The Ichimoku Kinko Hyo, also known simply as the [Ichimoku Cloud](../i/ichimoku_cloud.md) or Ichimoku [Indicator](../i/indicator.md), is a comprehensive and versatile [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) tool used in trading. Developed by Japanese journalist Goichi Hosoda in the late 1930s, it was not introduced to the public until 1968. The term "Ichimoku Kinko Hyo" translates roughly to "one glance [equilibrium](../e/equilibrium.md) chart," emphasizing its design to enable traders to quickly assess [market](../m/market.md) conditions at a glance. The [Ichimoku Cloud](../i/ichimoku_cloud.md) is particularly popular among forex traders but can be applied to any [market](../m/market.md), including equities, commodities, and cryptocurrencies.

The Ichimoku [Indicator](../i/indicator.md) consists of five main components, each providing unique insights into [market](../m/market.md) trends, [momentum](../m/momentum.md), and potential [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels. These components are:

1. Tenkan-sen (Conversion Line)
2. Kijun-sen (Base Line)
3. Senkou Span A (Leading Span A)
4. Senkou Span B (Leading Span B)
5. Chikou Span (Lagging Span)

Together, these five components form the [Ichimoku Cloud](../i/ichimoku_cloud.md) and [offer](../o/offer.md) a multi-dimensional view of [price action](../p/price_action.md). Each component [will](../w/will.md) be explained in detail below.

## Tenkan-sen (Conversion Line)

The Tenkan-sen, also known as the Conversion Line, is calculated as the average of the highest high and the lowest low over the past 9 periods. Its formula is:

```
Tenkan-sen = (Highest High + Lowest Low) / 2 over the last 9 periods
```

The Tenkan-sen is used primarily to gauge the short-term [momentum](../m/momentum.md) of the [market](../m/market.md). When the price is above the Tenkan-sen, it signals bullish [momentum](../m/momentum.md), and when the price is below, it signals bearish [momentum](../m/momentum.md). The Tenkan-sen is also often used as a signal line for potential [trade](../t/trade.md) entries and exits when it crosses the Kijun-sen (Base Line), forming what's known as a "TK Cross."

## Kijun-sen (Base Line)

The Kijun-sen, or Base Line, is calculated similarly to the Tenkan-sen but over a longer period of 26 periods. Its formula is:

```
Kijun-sen = (Highest High + Lowest Low) / 2 over the last 26 periods
```

The Kijun-sen serves as an [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of medium-term [market](../m/market.md) [momentum](../m/momentum.md) and [trend](../t/trend.md). It acts as a major support/resistance level. Crosses between the Tenkan-sen and Kijun-sen provide crucial [trading signals](../t/trading_signals.md). When the Tenkan-sen crosses above the Kijun-sen, it indicates a bullish signal, while a cross below indicates a bearish signal. The Kijun-sen can also be used in isolation to assess the overall [trend](../t/trend.md) and potential [reversal](../r/reversal.md) points.

## Senkou Span A (Leading Span A)

Senkou Span A is one of the two boundaries that form the [Ichimoku Cloud](../i/ichimoku_cloud.md), also known as the "Kumo." It is calculated as:

```
Senkou Span A = (Tenkan-sen + Kijun-sen) / 2, plotted 26 periods into the future
```

The Senkou Span A is a [leading indicator](../l/leading_indicator.md), plotted 26 periods ahead of the current price, providing insight into future [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels. When the Senkou Span A is above the Senkou Span B, it creates a bullish Kumo (cloud), suggesting a bullish [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md). Conversely, when Senkou Span A is below Senkou Span B, it forms a bearish Kumo, indicating a bearish [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md). The thickness of the Kumo can also give traders an idea of the [market](../m/market.md)'s [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and potential areas of price congestion.

## Senkou Span B (Leading Span B)

Senkou Span B is the second boundary of the [Ichimoku Cloud](../i/ichimoku_cloud.md) and is calculated as:

```
Senkou Span B = (Highest High + Lowest Low) / 2 over the past 52 periods, plotted 26 periods into the future
```

Like Senkou Span A, Senkou Span B is a [leading indicator](../l/leading_indicator.md). It is plotted 26 periods ahead, [offering](../o/offering.md) traders a longer-term view of future [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels. The interaction between Senkou Span A and B forms the Kumo, whose color and thickness help in understanding [market](../m/market.md) conditions. Generally, a thicker Kumo suggests stronger support/resistance and greater [volatility](../v/volatility.md), while a thinner Kumo indicates weaker support/resistance and lower [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

## Chikou Span (Lagging Span)

The Chikou Span, or Lagging Span, is calculated as the closing price of the current period plotted 26 periods back. Unlike the other components, it is a [lagging indicator](../l/lagging_indicator.md). Its formula is:

```
Chikou Span = Closing Price, plotted 26 periods back
```

The Chikou Span offers a historical perspective, allowing traders to compare the current [price action](../p/price_action.md) with that of 26 periods ago. If the Chikou Span is above the price of 26 periods ago, it indicates bullish sentiment. If it is below, it signifies bearish sentiment. The Chikou Span can also be used to identify [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels based on historical [price action](../p/price_action.md).

## Practical Application of Ichimoku Kinko Hyo

The Ichimoku Kinko Hyo is a versatile tool that can be used in various ways to enhance [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). Here are some common applications:

### Trend Identification

One of the primary uses of the Ichimoku [Indicator](../i/indicator.md) is to identify [market](../m/market.md) trends. When the price is above the Kumo, it indicates a bullish [trend](../t/trend.md), while a price below the Kumo suggests a bearish [trend](../t/trend.md). A flat Kumo can indicate a ranging [market](../m/market.md) with no clear [trend](../t/trend.md).

### Entry and Exit Signals

The Ichimoku [Indicator](../i/indicator.md) provides clear entry and exit signals through the crossing of the Tenkan-sen and Kijun-sen lines, known as the "TK Cross." A bullish TK Cross occurs when the Tenkan-sen crosses above the Kijun-sen, signaling a potential buy opportunity. Conversely, a bearish TK Cross happens when the Tenkan-sen crosses below the Kijun-sen, indicating a potential sell opportunity.

### Support and Resistance Levels

The Senkou Span A and Senkou Span B lines that form the Kumo act as dynamic [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels. The thickness of the Kumo provides additional information about the strength of these levels. A thicker Kumo suggests stronger support or resistance, while a thinner Kumo indicates weaker levels.

### Momentum Analysis

The Tenkan-sen and Kijun-sen lines [offer](../o/offer.md) insights into short-term and medium-term [market](../m/market.md) [momentum](../m/momentum.md). The relative positioning of these lines with respect to the price and each other can help traders determine the strength and direction of the [momentum](../m/momentum.md).

### Confirmation with Other Indicators

While the Ichimoku Kinko Hyo is a standalone [indicator](../i/indicator.md), it can also be used in conjunction with other [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicator.md) for additional confirmation. For example, combining the [Ichimoku Cloud](../i/ichimoku_cloud.md) with Moving Averages, RSI, or MACD can provide a more comprehensive analysis.

## Conclusion

The Ichimoku Kinko Hyo is a sophisticated and holistic trading tool that provides a comprehensive view of [market](../m/market.md) trends, [momentum](../m/momentum.md), and [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels. Its five components—Tenkan-sen, Kijun-sen, Senkou Span A, Senkou Span B, and Chikou Span—work together to [offer](../o/offer.md) a multi-dimensional analysis that can enhance trading decisions. By understanding and applying the Ichimoku [Indicator](../i/indicator.md), traders can [gain](../g/gain.md) valuable insights into [market](../m/market.md) conditions and improve their [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). For an in-depth exploration of the Ichimoku Kinko Hyo [Indicator](../i/indicator.md), traders can refer to various trading platforms and resources offered by financial educators such as Investopedia (https://www.investopedia.com), [TradingView](../t/tradingview.md) (https://www.[tradingview](../t/tradingview.md).com), and BabyPips (https://www.babypips.com).

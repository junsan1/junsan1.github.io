# Iran Fara Bourse (IFB)

Iran Fara Bourse (IFB) is an Iranian over-the-counter (OTC) market for securities and other financial instruments. Established in 2008, it operates under the supervision of Iran's Securities and Exchange Organization (SEO) and provides a platform for securities that do not meet Tehran Stock Exchange's (TSE) listing criteria. The IFB facilitates the trading of a wide range of financial instruments, including stocks, bonds, and derivatives. This makes it a vital component of Iran's financial market infrastructure, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and startups.

## Overview

### Purpose and Operations
The IFB was established with the aim of creating a more flexible trading environment. Unlike the TSE, which has stringent listing requirements, the IFB offers a relaxed regulatory framework that allows smaller, emerging companies to raise capital. This increases market liquidity and offers investors a broader range of investment opportunities. The market operates electronically and uses a fully automated trading system to ensure transparency and efficiency.

### Regulatory Framework
Iran Fara Bourse is governed by the Securities Market Act of the Islamic Republic of Iran, which provides it with the legal authority to operate as an OTC market. The SEO closely monitors all operations, ensures compliance with regulatory requirements, and oversees the market to protect investor interests. Companies listed on the IFB are subject to disclosure requirements, including periodic financial reporting and adherence to corporate governance standards.

## Market Structure

### Trading Segments
The IFB has several market segments to accommodate various types of securities:

1. **Base Market**: This is the primary market for trading securities that cannot be listed on the TSE. It includes stocks of smaller companies and those in recovery phases.
2. **Secondary Market**: This market segment facilitates the trading of securities that have already been issued and provides liquidity for investors.
3. **Modern Financial Instruments Market**: This segment deals with trading in derivatives, including futures and options contracts.
4. **Small & Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) Market**: Specifically designed for startups and smaller companies, this segment provides easier access to capital markets.

### Trading System
IFB uses an electronic trading system known as the "Extranet System." This system provides secure, efficient, and transparent trading. It also allows for real-time data dissemination, order execution, and transaction processing. The electronic nature of the system minimizes the risk of errors and fraud, thereby increasing market integrity.

### Market Participants
Participants in the IFB include individual investors, institutional investors, broker-dealer firms, and market makers. These entities contribute to the liquidity and stability of the market. Broker-dealers play a critical role by facilitating trades on behalf of clients and ensuring best execution practices.

## Financial Instruments

### Equities
Stocks of companies that do not meet the listing criteria of the TSE are traded on the IFB. These include shares of newly established firms, family-run businesses, and SMEs looking to expand.

### Fixed Income Securities
The IFB offers various fixed-income instruments, such as corporate bonds, government bonds, and municipal bonds. These instruments provide investors with a relatively safer investment option compared to equities.

### Derivatives
The IFB has a dedicated segment for derivatives trading, including futures and options contracts. These financial instruments allow investors to hedge risks and speculate on price movements of underlying assets.

### Sukuk

## Trading Mechanics

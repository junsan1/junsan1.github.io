# Inter-Vivos Trust

An inter-vivos [trust](../t/trust.md), also known as a [living trust](../l/living_trust.md), is a legal entity created during an individual's lifetime for the purpose of managing and protecting their assets. This type of [trust](../t/trust.md) is often utilized in [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md) to ensure that assets are handled according to the [grantor](../g/grantor.md)'s wishes, both during their life and after their death. The term "inter-vivos" is Latin for "between the living," distinguishing it from a [testamentary trust](../t/testamentary_trust.md), which is created through a [will](../w/will.md) and only takes effect after the [grantor](../g/grantor.md)'s death.

## Key Components of an Inter-Vivos Trust

### Grantor

The [grantor](../g/grantor.md), also known as the settlor or trustor, is the individual who creates the [trust](../t/trust.md) and transfers assets into it. The [grantor](../g/grantor.md) sets the terms of the [trust](../t/trust.md), including how and when the assets [will](../w/will.md) be distributed to beneficiaries.

### Trustee

The [trustee](../t/trustee.md) is the person or entity responsible for managing the [trust](../t/trust.md)'s assets according to the [trust](../t/trust.md) agreement's terms. The [trustee](../t/trustee.md) can be the [grantor](../g/grantor.md) themselves, another individual, or a professional fiduciary institution. The [trustee](../t/trustee.md) has a fiduciary duty to manage the [trust](../t/trust.md) assets in the best interests of the beneficiaries.

### Beneficiaries

Beneficiaries are the individuals or entities entitled to receive distributions from the [trust](../t/trust.md). The [grantor](../g/grantor.md) designates the beneficiaries and specifies the terms and conditions under which they [will](../w/will.md) receive the [trust](../t/trust.md) assets.

### Trust Agreement

The [trust](../t/trust.md) agreement, also known as the [trust](../t/trust.md) instrument or [declaration of trust](../d/declaration_of_trust.md), is the legal document that establishes the [trust](../t/trust.md). It outlines the terms and conditions, including the duties and powers of the [trustee](../t/trustee.md), the rights of the beneficiaries, and the rules governing the management and [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of the [trust](../t/trust.md) assets.

## Types of Inter-Vivos Trusts

### Revocable Trust

A [revocable trust](../r/revocable_trust.md) allows the [grantor](../g/grantor.md) to retain control over the [trust](../t/trust.md) and its assets during their lifetime. The [grantor](../g/grantor.md) can modify, amend, or revoke the [trust](../t/trust.md) at any time. This type of [trust](../t/trust.md) provides flexibility and allows the [grantor](../g/grantor.md) to make changes as their circumstances or wishes change. However, because the [grantor](../g/grantor.md) retains control over the assets, they are still considered part of the [grantor](../g/grantor.md)'s [estate](../e/estate.md) for tax purposes.

### Irrevocable Trust

An [irrevocable trust](../i/irrevocable_trust.md), once established, generally cannot be altered, amended, or revoked by the [grantor](../g/grantor.md). This type of [trust](../t/trust.md) effectively removes the assets from the [grantor](../g/grantor.md)'s [estate](../e/estate.md), which can provide significant tax benefits and protect the assets from creditors. Since the [grantor](../g/grantor.md) relinquishes control over the assets, they are no longer part of the [grantor](../g/grantor.md)'s taxable [estate](../e/estate.md).

## Benefits of an Inter-Vivos Trust

### Avoiding Probate

One of the primary benefits of an inter-vivos [trust](../t/trust.md) is that it allows the assets to bypass the [probate](../p/probate.md) process. [Probate](../p/probate.md) is the court-supervised process of distributing a deceased person's [estate](../e/estate.md), which can be lengthy, costly, and public. By placing assets in a [trust](../t/trust.md), they can be transferred to the beneficiaries without the need for [probate](../p/probate.md), providing privacy and potentially reducing legal fees and delays.

### Continuity of Management

An inter-vivos [trust](../t/trust.md) ensures the continuous management of the [grantor](../g/grantor.md)'s assets, even if the [grantor](../g/grantor.md) becomes incapacitated. The [trustee](../t/trustee.md) can step in to manage the [trust](../t/trust.md) assets without the need for court intervention, ensuring that the [grantor](../g/grantor.md)'s affairs are handled according to their wishes.

### Flexibility and Control

A revocable inter-vivos [trust](../t/trust.md) provides the [grantor](../g/grantor.md) with flexibility and control over their assets during their lifetime. The [grantor](../g/grantor.md) can make changes to the [trust](../t/trust.md) as needed and manage the assets in accordance with their wishes.

### Asset Protection

While a [revocable trust](../r/revocable_trust.md) does not [offer](../o/offer.md) protection from creditors, an [irrevocable trust](../i/irrevocable_trust.md) can provide significant [asset protection](../a/asset_protection.md) benefits. By transferring assets to an [irrevocable trust](../i/irrevocable_trust.md), the [grantor](../g/grantor.md) effectively removes them from their [estate](../e/estate.md), potentially shielding them from creditors' claims and certain legal judgments.

### Tax Benefits

An irrevocable inter-vivos [trust](../t/trust.md) can provide tax benefits by removing the assets from the [grantor](../g/grantor.md)'s taxable [estate](../e/estate.md). This can reduce [estate](../e/estate.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) and, in some cases, [income](../i/income.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md). Certain types of irrevocable trusts, such as Charitable Remainder Trusts and Qualified Personal Residence Trusts, [offer](../o/offer.md) specific tax advantages.

## Considerations and Drawbacks

### Complexity and Cost

Establishing and maintaining an inter-vivos [trust](../t/trust.md) can be complex and costly. Legal fees for setting up the [trust](../t/trust.md), ongoing administrative costs, and potential fees for professional trustees can add up. It's important to weigh these costs against the benefits provided by the [trust](../t/trust.md).

### Control and Flexibility

While a [revocable trust](../r/revocable_trust.md) offers control and flexibility, an [irrevocable trust](../i/irrevocable_trust.md) requires the [grantor](../g/grantor.md) to relinquish control over the assets, which can be a significant drawback. It's important to carefully consider whether the benefits of an [irrevocable trust](../i/irrevocable_trust.md) outweigh the loss of control.

### Impact on Public Benefits

For individuals receiving public benefits such as [Medicaid](../m/medicaid.md), transferring assets to an [irrevocable trust](../i/irrevocable_trust.md) could impact eligibility for these benefits. It's important to consult with a knowledgeable attorney to understand how a [trust](../t/trust.md) may affect public benefits eligibility.

### Funding the Trust

For an inter-vivos [trust](../t/trust.md) to be effective, it must be properly funded. This means that the [grantor](../g/grantor.md) must transfer ownership of their assets into the [trust](../t/trust.md). This can involve additional administrative steps and costs.

## Use Cases in Estate Planning

### Planning for Incapacity

An inter-vivos [trust](../t/trust.md) can be an effective tool for planning for the possibility of the [grantor](../g/grantor.md)'s incapacity. By designating a successor [trustee](../t/trustee.md), the [grantor](../g/grantor.md) ensures that their assets [will](../w/will.md) be managed according to their wishes if they become unable to do so themselves.

### Blended Families

An inter-vivos [trust](../t/trust.md) can help address the unique [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md) challenges faced by blended families. The [grantor](../g/grantor.md) can specify how assets [will](../w/will.md) be distributed among children from different marriages, ensuring that their wishes are carried out while avoiding potential conflicts and misunderstandings.

### Privacy Concerns

For individuals who [value](../v/value.md) privacy, an inter-vivos [trust](../t/trust.md) can provide a level of confidentiality that is not possible with a [will](../w/will.md). The [trust](../t/trust.md) agreement is not a public document, allowing the details of the [grantor](../g/grantor.md)'s [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md) to remain private.

### Special Needs Planning

An inter-vivos [trust](../t/trust.md) can be used to provide for a [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md) with special needs without jeopardizing their eligibility for public benefits. A special needs [trust](../t/trust.md) or supplemental needs [trust](../t/trust.md) can be established within an inter-vivos [trust](../t/trust.md) to provide for the [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md)'s needs while preserving their benefits.

### Charitable Giving

Inter-vivos trusts can be used to facilitate charitable giving. A Charitable Remainder [Trust](../t/trust.md) (CRT) allows the [grantor](../g/grantor.md) to receive [income](../i/income.md) from the [trust](../t/trust.md) during their lifetime, with the remainder going to a designated charity. This can provide both tax benefits and a way to support charitable causes.

## Conclusion

An inter-vivos [trust](../t/trust.md) is a versatile and powerful tool in [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md). It allows individuals to manage and protect their assets during their lifetime and beyond, providing benefits such as avoiding [probate](../p/probate.md), ensuring continuity of management, and [offering](../o/offering.md) potential tax advantages. However, the complexity and costs associated with establishing and maintaining an inter-vivos [trust](../t/trust.md), as well as the potential impact on control and public benefits, necessitate careful consideration and professional [guidance](../g/guidance.md). By understanding the key components, benefits, and potential drawbacks, individuals can make informed decisions about whether an inter-vivos [trust](../t/trust.md) is the right choice for their [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md) needs.

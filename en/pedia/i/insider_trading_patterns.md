# Insider Trading Patterns

Insider trading refers to the buying or selling of a publicly traded company’s stock by individuals with access to non-public information about the company. Insiders include major shareholders, executives, directors, and any other individual or entity that obtains non-public information regarding the company. When done lawfully, insider trading is legitimate; however, illegal insider trading involves the abuse of this privileged access to confidential information for personal gain, leading to severe penalties and criminal charges.

## Introduction to Insider Trading

Insider trading first gained recognition during the early 20th century, as markets began to formalize. Over the decades, various regulatory frameworks have been established to detect and deter illicit insider trading activities. The primary regulatory body in the United States overseeing insider trading is the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

## Legal Insider Trading

Not all insider trading is illegal. Legal insider trading occurs when corporate insiders—officers, directors, and employees—buy and sell stock in their own companies. These transactions must be reported to the SEC, which ensures transparency and fairness. Insiders are required to file a Form 4 within two business days of a transaction.

### Types of Legal Insider Trading

1. **Planned Trading Programs (Rule 10b5-1 Plans)**: These are pre-determined trading plans allowed by the SEC, which enable insiders to sell a predetermined number of shares at regular intervals.

2. **Closed Periods**: These are specific time periods during which insiders cannot trade their company’s stock to prevent conflicts of interest.

3. **Open Market Purchases**: Insiders can buy stock on the open market as long as they comply with the SEC regulations.

## Illegal Insider Trading

Illegal insider trading occurs when insiders trade based on non-public, material information. This kind of trading is detrimental to market integrity as it unfairly advantages insiders over regular investors. The SEC has stringent rules to combat illegal insider trading, incorporating surveillance and advanced analytics for detection.

### Examples of Illegal Insider Trading

1. **High-profile Cases**: Several high-profile cases have made headlines, including those involving prominent figures such as Martha Stewart and Raj Rajaratnam, showcasing the severe ramifications of illegal insider trading.
2. **Tipping**: Passing non-public information to another individual (tipping) who then makes a trade also constitutes illegal insider trading.

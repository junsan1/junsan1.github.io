# Issued Shares

Issued shares represent the total number of shares that a company has ever issued (allocated) to its shareholders. This quantity includes shares held by shareholders and restricted shares held by the company’s officers and insiders. The number of issued shares is a crucial metric in the world of finance and investing, often contrasted with outstanding shares and treasury shares. Understanding issued shares is integral to comprehending the capitalization structure of a company and making informed investment decisions. 

## Concept of Issued Shares 

Issued shares are the portions of company ownership that have been distributed to shareholders. These shares can be either common or preferred shares:

- **Common Shares**: Common shares usually carry voting power and represent an equity stake in the company. These shareholders benefit from dividends and capital appreciation, though they rank behind preferred shareholders in priority during liquidation.
- **Preferred Shares**: Preferred shares offer no voting rights but provide preferential treatment in dividend distribution and asset liquidation.

Once a company decides to issue shares, they can no longer reclaim these shares into their unissued share pool. However, they can buy them back into their treasury.

## Relevance in the Market

The number of issued shares is essential information for several key reasons:

- **Market Capitalization**: It aids in calculating a company’s market capital (Market Cap = Number of Issued Shares x Share Price).
- **Earnings Per Share (EPS)**: EPS is computed using either the total number of issued shares or the total shares outstanding, indicating a company's profitability.
- **Share Dilution**: When a company issues additional shares, existing shareholders might experience dilution, reducing their percentage ownership in the company.
- **Voting Power**: Shareholders’ voting power often correlates with the number of common shares owned, affecting corporate governance.

## How Issued Shares Work

### Initial Public Offering (IPO)

- **Initial Distribution**: When a company goes public, it performs an Initial Public Offering (IPO). During an IPO, the company determines the volume of issued shares and sets a price per share.
  
- **Allocation**: These shares are then sold to institutional and retail investors. The money raised from this process is used for various corporate purposes, such as expanding operations or paying off debt.

### Post-IPO

- **Secondary Offerings**: After the IPO, companies may issue additional shares through secondary offerings to raise more capital. This process increases the total number of issued shares.

- **Stock Splits**: Companies might also perform stock splits, increasing the number of shares while dividing the share price, keeping market capitalization balanced.

### Buybacks and Treasury Stock

- **Share Buybacks**: Companies often buy back their shares from the marketplace. These shares turn into treasury stock and are not considered in earnings per share calculations. Share buybacks reduce the number of issued (and outstanding) shares, often boosting the value of remaining shares.
- **Reissuance**: Treasury shares can be reissued to investors for diverse purposes, such as raising additional capital, employee stock options, or shareholder dividends.

## Legal and Regulatory Aspects

Several laws and regulations govern the issuance and number of shares a company can distribute. These include:

- **Corporate Charter**: A company’s corporate charter defines the authorized share capital, limiting the maximum issued shares possible.
- **Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)**: In the U.S., regulatory bodies like the SEC oversee public offerings and additional share issuances to ensure compliance with securities laws.

## Case Studies

### Tesla, Inc. (https://www.tesla.com/)

Tesla, Inc. provides an insightful case study about issued shares. Tesla ran an IPO on June 29, 2010, offering 13.3 million shares at $17 each. Since then, Tesla has issued more shares several times, both through direct offerings and employee stock options, significantly increasing its total issued shares volume over the years. These strategic moves raised capital for their aggressive growth and expansion plans.

### Apple Inc. (https://www.apple.com/)

Apple Inc. is another prime example. The tech giant has performed several stock splits throughout its history, notably a 7-for-1 stock split in June 2014 and a 4-for-1 stock split in August 2020. These actions increased issued shares, democratizing investment by making shares more affordable to the average investor while preserving the company’s market cap.

## Conclusion

In summary, issued shares embody a fundamental element of a corporation's equity structure, reflecting the ownership distributed to shareholders. They are instrumental in determining market capitalization, investor returns, and impact shareholder voting power. Through initial and secondary offerings, stock splits, and share buybacks, companies strategically manage the volume of issued shares to meet their financial and strategic objectives. Comprehending issued shares and their implications is pivotal for investors, analysts, and anyone involved in corporate finance.

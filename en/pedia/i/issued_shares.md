# Issued Shares

Issued [shares](../s/shares.md) represent the total number of [shares](../s/shares.md) that a company has ever issued (allocated) to its shareholders. This quantity includes [shares](../s/shares.md) held by shareholders and restricted [shares](../s/shares.md) held by the company’s officers and insiders. The number of issued [shares](../s/shares.md) is a crucial metric in the world of [finance](../f/finance.md) and [investing](../i/investing.md), often contrasted with outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md) and treasury [shares](../s/shares.md). Understanding issued [shares](../s/shares.md) is integral to comprehending the [capitalization](../c/capitalization.md) structure of a company and making informed investment decisions. 

## Concept of Issued Shares 

Issued [shares](../s/shares.md) are the portions of company ownership that have been distributed to shareholders. These [shares](../s/shares.md) can be either common or preferred [shares](../s/shares.md):

- **Common [Shares](../s/shares.md)**: Common [shares](../s/shares.md) usually carry voting power and represent an [equity](../e/equity.md) stake in the company. These shareholders benefit from dividends and [capital](../c/capital.md) appreciation, though they rank behind preferred shareholders in priority during [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md).
- **Preferred [Shares](../s/shares.md)**: Preferred [shares](../s/shares.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) no voting rights but provide preferential treatment in [dividend](../d/dividend.md) [distribution](../d/distribution.md) and [asset](../a/asset.md) [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md).

Once a company decides to [issue](../i/issue.md) [shares](../s/shares.md), they can no longer reclaim these [shares](../s/shares.md) into their unissued share pool. However, they can buy them back into their treasury.

## Relevance in the Market

The number of issued [shares](../s/shares.md) is essential information for several key reasons:

- **[Market Capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md)**: It aids in calculating a company’s [market](../m/market.md) [capital](../c/capital.md) ([Market](../m/market.md) Cap = Number of Issued [Shares](../s/shares.md) x Share Price).
- **[Earnings](../e/earnings.md) Per Share (EPS)**: EPS is computed using either the total number of issued [shares](../s/shares.md) or the total [shares](../s/shares.md) outstanding, indicating a company's profitability.
- **Share [Dilution](../d/dilution.md)**: When a company issues additional [shares](../s/shares.md), existing shareholders might experience [dilution](../d/dilution.md), reducing their percentage ownership in the company.
- **Voting Power**: Shareholders’ voting power often correlates with the number of common [shares](../s/shares.md) owned, affecting [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md).

## How Issued Shares Work

### Initial Public Offering (IPO)

- **Initial [Distribution](../d/distribution.md)**: When a company goes public, it performs an Initial Public [Offering](../o/offering.md) (IPO). During an IPO, the company determines the [volume](../v/volume.md) of issued [shares](../s/shares.md) and sets a price per share.
  
- **Allocation**: These [shares](../s/shares.md) are then sold to institutional and retail investors. The [money](../m/money.md) raised from this process is used for various corporate purposes, such as expanding operations or paying off [debt](../d/debt.md).

### Post-IPO

- **Secondary Offerings**: After the IPO, companies may [issue](../i/issue.md) additional [shares](../s/shares.md) through secondary offerings to raise more [capital](../c/capital.md). This process increases the total number of issued [shares](../s/shares.md).

- **Stock Splits**: Companies might also perform stock splits, increasing the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) while dividing the share price, keeping [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) balanced.

### Buybacks and Treasury Stock

- **[Share Buybacks](../s/share_buybacks.md)**: Companies often buy back their [shares](../s/shares.md) from the marketplace. These [shares](../s/shares.md) turn into treasury stock and are not considered in [earnings](../e/earnings.md) per share calculations. [Share buybacks](../s/share_buybacks.md) reduce the number of issued (and outstanding) [shares](../s/shares.md), often boosting the [value](../v/value.md) of remaining [shares](../s/shares.md).
- **Reissuance**: Treasury [shares](../s/shares.md) can be reissued to investors for diverse purposes, such as raising additional [capital](../c/capital.md), employee stock [options](../o/options.md), or [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) dividends.

## Legal and Regulatory Aspects

Several laws and regulations govern the issuance and number of [shares](../s/shares.md) a company can distribute. These include:

- **[Corporate Charter](../c/corporate_charter.md)**: A company’s [corporate charter](../c/corporate_charter.md) defines the authorized share [capital](../c/capital.md), limiting the maximum issued [shares](../s/shares.md) possible.
- **Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC)**: In the U.S., regulatory bodies like the SEC oversee public offerings and additional share issuances to ensure compliance with securities laws.

## Case Studies

### Tesla, Inc. (https://www.tesla.com/)

Tesla, Inc. provides an insightful case study about issued [shares](../s/shares.md). Tesla ran an IPO on June 29, 2010, [offering](../o/offering.md) 13.3 million [shares](../s/shares.md) at $17 each. Since then, Tesla has issued more [shares](../s/shares.md) several times, both through direct offerings and employee stock [options](../o/options.md), significantly increasing its total issued [shares](../s/shares.md) [volume](../v/volume.md) over the years. These strategic moves raised [capital](../c/capital.md) for their aggressive growth and [expansion](../e/expansion.md) plans.

### Apple Inc. (https://www.apple.com/)

Apple Inc. is another prime example. The tech giant has performed several stock splits throughout its history, notably a 7-for-1 [stock split](../s/stock_split.md) in June 2014 and a 4-for-1 [stock split](../s/stock_split.md) in August 2020. These actions increased issued [shares](../s/shares.md), democratizing investment by making [shares](../s/shares.md) more affordable to the average [investor](../i/investor.md) while preserving the company’s [market](../m/market.md) cap.

## Conclusion

In summary, issued [shares](../s/shares.md) embody a fundamental element of a [corporation](../c/corporation.md)'s [equity](../e/equity.md) structure, reflecting the ownership distributed to shareholders. They are instrumental in determining [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md), [investor](../i/investor.md) returns, and impact [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) voting power. Through initial and secondary offerings, stock splits, and [share buybacks](../s/share_buybacks.md), companies strategically manage the [volume](../v/volume.md) of issued [shares](../s/shares.md) to meet their financial and strategic objectives. Comprehending issued [shares](../s/shares.md) and their implications is pivotal for investors, analysts, and anyone involved in [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md).

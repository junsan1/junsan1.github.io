# Impaired Asset

## Introduction to Impaired Assets

An impaired [asset](../a/asset.md) is a company [asset](../a/asset.md) that has a [market value](../m/market_value.md) less than the [value](../v/value.md) [listed](../l/listed.md) on the company’s [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md). [Impairment](../i/impairment.md) occurs when one or more events cause the carrying amount ([book value](../b/book_value.md)) of an [asset](../a/asset.md) to exceed its recoverable amount. Essentially, an impaired [asset](../a/asset.md) is worth less than it is officially represented to be in [accounting](../a/accounting.md) records. This situation necessitates a [write-down](../w/write-down.md) to reflect the [asset](../a/asset.md)’s decrease in [value](../v/value.md) accurately.

[Asset](../a/asset.md) [impairment](../i/impairment.md) can significantly affect a company’s [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) and requires rigorous testing, evaluation, and record-keeping to ensure faithful representation of the company's actual financial situation.

## Causes of Asset Impairment

Several factors can lead to [asset](../a/asset.md) [impairment](../i/impairment.md). The main causes include:

1. **Economic Downturns**: During economic recessions, the [market value](../m/market_value.md) of assets such as [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), machinery, and equipment can significantly decrease.
 
2. **Technological Obsolescence**: Advances in technology can render existing equipment or software obsolete, leading to [impairment](../i/impairment.md). 

3. **Physical Damage**: Assets that suffer physical damage, such as in a natural disaster, can see their [value](../v/value.md) plummet.

4. **Legal or Regulatory Changes**: New laws or regulations might impair the [utility](../u/utility.md) or profitability of certain assets.

5. **Poor Management or Operational Issues**: Mismanagement can lead to underutilization or reduced [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) of assets, thereby impairing them.

6. **[Market](../m/market.md) Changes**: Shifts in [market](../m/market.md) [demand](../d/demand.md) or [supply](../s/supply.md) can negatively impact the [value](../v/value.md) of an [asset](../a/asset.md). For example, a drop in [demand](../d/demand.md) for a product may reduce the [value](../v/value.md) of the equipment used to produce it.

## How to Test for Asset Impairment

Testing for [impairment](../i/impairment.md) is a methodical process that comprises several steps. The primary international [accounting](../a/accounting.md) standards guiding [impairment](../i/impairment.md) tests are the International [Accounting](../a/accounting.md) Standards (IAS) 36.

### Step-by-Step Process for Testing Impairment:

### 1. **Identify Scope for Testing**

    Initially, identify the assets to be tested for [impairment](../i/impairment.md). Not all assets need to be tested every reporting period.

### 2. **Review Indicators of Impairment**

   Indicators could include a significant decline in [market value](../m/market_value.md), changes in the technological, [market](../m/market.md), economic, or legal environment, or internal evidence indicating an [asset](../a/asset.md)'s performance does not meet expectations.

### 3. **Estimate Recoverable Amount**

   The recoverable amount is the higher of an [asset](../a/asset.md)'s [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) less costs of disposal (net selling price) and its [value](../v/value.md) in use.

   - **[Fair Value](../f/fair_value.md) Less Costs of Disposal**: This is the amount obtainable from the [sale](../s/sale.md) of an [asset](../a/asset.md) minus the costs directly attributable to the [sale](../s/sale.md).
   
   - **[Value](../v/value.md) in Use**: This is the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of future cash flows expected to be derived from an [asset](../a/asset.md).

### 4. **Compare Carrying Amount and Recoverable Amount**

   If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, the [asset](../a/asset.md) is considered impaired.

### 5. **Calculate Impairment Loss**

   Calculate the [impairment](../i/impairment.md) loss as the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount.

### 6. **Write Down to Recoverable Amount**

   The recognized [impairment](../i/impairment.md) loss should be written down against the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s carrying amount on the company's [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md).

### 7. **Disclose Impairments in Financial Statements**

   Disclosures should include the amount of [impairment](../i/impairment.md) loss recognized, the events leading to the recognition, and an explanation of how the recoverable amount was determined.

## How To Record Impairment Loss

Proper recording of [impairment](../i/impairment.md) loss in [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) encompasses [multiple](../m/multiple.md) steps, helping ensure compliance with [accounting principles](../a/accounting_principles.md).

### Journal Entries to Record Impairment:

1. **Initial Recording**:

    The [impairment](../i/impairment.md) loss is recorded by debiting an [impairment](../i/impairment.md) loss account and crediting the [asset](../a/asset.md) account.

    ```markdown
    [Impairment](../i/impairment.md) Loss    XXX
         [Accumulated Depreciation](../a/accumulated_depreciation.md)      XXX
    ```

    This entry reduces the carrying amount of the [asset](../a/asset.md).

2. **Presentation in [Financial Statements](../f/financial_statements.md)**:

    The [impairment](../i/impairment.md) loss is presented in the [income statement](../i/income_statement.md), typically under operating expenses.

3. **[Disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) Details**:

    [Financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) should provide detailed [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) about the impaired [asset](../a/asset.md), including the amount of loss, reasons for [impairment](../i/impairment.md), and method of determining the recoverable amount.

## Examples of Asset Impairment

1. **[Goodwill Impairment](../g/goodwill_impairment.md)**: [Goodwill impairment](../g/goodwill_impairment.md) occurs when the acquired [business](../b/business.md) does not generate expected cash flows. Many companies in the retail sector, like J.C. Penney, have reported significant [goodwill](../g/goodwill.md) impairments during [restructuring](../r/restructuring.md) phases.

2. **[Inventory](../i/inventory.md) [Impairment](../i/impairment.md)**: A technology company holding [inventory](../i/inventory.md) of electronics that quickly become obsolete may need to impair the [inventory](../i/inventory.md) if its [market value](../m/market_value.md) declines below its cost.

3. **Investment [Impairment](../i/impairment.md)**: With fluctuating [market](../m/market.md) conditions, companies like investment firms might need to impair investments if they suffer significant losses.

4. **[Real Estate](../r/real_estate.md) [Impairment](../i/impairment.md)**: A [commercial real estate](../c/commercial_real_estate.md) company might face [impairment](../i/impairment.md) tests regularly due to [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) in property values.

## Impairment under IFRS and GAAP

Both International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Generally Accepted [Accounting Principles](../a/accounting_principles.md) (GAAP) provide [guidance](../g/guidance.md) on [asset](../a/asset.md) [impairment](../i/impairment.md), though there are differences.

### Under IFRS (IAS 36):

- Assets are tested for [impairment](../i/impairment.md) when there is an indication of [impairment](../i/impairment.md).
- [Goodwill](../g/goodwill.md) and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually.
- The recoverable amount is the higher of [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) less costs of disposal and [value](../v/value.md) in use.

### Under GAAP (ASC 360-10 and ASC 350):

- Long-lived assets are reviewed for [impairment](../i/impairment.md) when changes in circumstances indicate a possible [impairment](../i/impairment.md).
- [Goodwill](../g/goodwill.md) is tested annually.
- The recoverable amount is determined using the undiscounted [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) method.

### Differences Between IFRS and GAAP:

- **Testing Frequency**: IFRS requires an annual test for certain assets, while GAAP primarily requires a test based on indications of [impairment](../i/impairment.md).
- **Measurement of Recoverable Amount**: IFRS relies on the higher of the [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) or [value](../v/value.md) in use, while GAAP uses undiscounted cash flows for initial recognition.

## Real-World Implications

[Impairment](../i/impairment.md) of assets has tangible consequences for businesses, affecting their [financial health](../f/financial_health.md), stock prices, and [stakeholder](../s/stakeholder.md) perception. Leading companies such as General Electric and Deutsche [Bank](../b/bank.md) have had significant impairments that impacted their [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md).

- **General Electric**: Faced a massive [goodwill impairment](../g/goodwill_impairment.md) charge in 2018, leading to a considerable reduction in their stock price.
- **Deutsche [Bank](../b/bank.md)**: Reported substantial impairments on [goodwill](../g/goodwill.md) and other intangible assets due to operational [restructuring](../r/restructuring.md).

[General Electric](https://www.ge.com) has detailed on their official site how impairments have been handled historically in their [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md). Similarly, [Deutsche Bank](https://www.db.com) provides insights into the methodology behind their [impairment](../i/impairment.md) assessments.

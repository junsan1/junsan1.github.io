# Intertemporal Choice

Intertemporal choice is a concept that originates from [economics](../e/economics.md) and psychology. It refers to the decisions that individuals make which involve [trade](../t/trade.md)-offs among costs and benefits occurring at different times. These decisions can [range](../r/range.md) from everyday financial choices like saving [money](../m/money.md) for future use, to broader life decisions such as [investing](../i/investing.md) in education or health. Intertemporal choice has significant implications for various economic theories and applications, including [retirement planning](../r/retirement_planning.md), consumption patterns, and policy making.

The concept is rooted in the notion that people [value](../v/value.md) rewards disbursed across different periods differently. For example, a person might prefer to receive $100 today rather than $110 in a month, reflecting a preference for immediate rewards over greater future rewards. This behavior can be explained through various theoretical frameworks and models, such as the Discounted [Utility](../u/utility.md) Model, hyperbolic [discounting](../d/discounting.md), and quasi-hyperbolic [discounting](../d/discounting.md).

## Discounted Utility Model

The Discounted [Utility](../u/utility.md) Model (DU) proposed by Paul Samuelson in 1937 is one of the foundational models used to describe intertemporal choice. According to this model, the [value](../v/value.md) of future [utility](../u/utility.md) decreases in proportion to its delay. The model envisages [utility](../u/utility.md) over time as follows:

\[ DU = \sum_{t=0}^{T} \frac{U_t}{(1 + \[rho](../r/rho.md))^t} \]

where \(U_t\) is the [utility](../u/utility.md) at time \(t\), \(T\) is the [time horizon](../t/time_horizon.md), and \(\[rho](../r/rho.md)\) is the [discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md).

The model assumes a consistent [discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md) over time and posits that individuals rationally evaluate the [trade](../t/trade.md)-offs between present and future [utility](../u/utility.md) based on this constant rate. While the DU model provides a useful framework, empirical evidence suggests that actual human behavior often deviates from the assumptions of constant [discounting](../d/discounting.md), introducing the need for alternative models.

## Hyperbolic Discounting

Hyperbolic [discounting](../d/discounting.md) is an alternative model that better captures observed inconsistencies in intertemporal choices. Unlike the DU model, which assumes exponential [discounting](../d/discounting.md), hyperbolic [discounting](../d/discounting.md) assumes that the [discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md) decreases over time. This can be represented mathematically as:

\[ V = \frac{V_0}{1 + kt} \]

where \(V_0\) is the [present value](../p/present_value.md), \(t\) is the delay, and \(k\) is the hyperbolic [discounting](../d/discounting.md) rate.

Hyperbolic [discounting](../d/discounting.md) accounts for the preference reversals that occur when comparing short-term to long-term delays. For example, an individual may prefer $100 today over $110 in a month, but prefer $110 in a year over $100 in 11 months, even though both situations involve a one-month delay.

## Quasi-Hyperbolic Discounting

Quasi-hyperbolic [discounting](../d/discounting.md), introduced by Laibson (1997), integrates aspects of both exponential and hyperbolic [discounting](../d/discounting.md). It modifies the DU model to better reflect the tendency of individuals to strongly prefer immediate rewards. The model is expressed as:

\[ V = V_0 + \[beta](../b/beta.md) \sum_{t=1}^{T} \frac{V_t}{(1 + \[rho](../r/rho.md))^t} \]

where \(\[beta](../b/beta.md)\) represents the present-bias [factor](../f/factor.md) (0 < \(\[beta](../b/beta.md)\) < 1).

This model incorporates a short-term [discount](../d/discount.md) [factor](../f/factor.md) that declines more steeply for immediate time periods while converging to the exponential [discounting](../d/discounting.md) model for longer time horizons, thereby capturing both the present bias and the long-term planning behavior.

## Behavioral Aspects of Intertemporal Choice

Intertemporal choice is influenced by psychological and behavioral factors that challenge the traditional economic assumptions of rationality and consistency. [Cognitive biases](../c/cognitive_biases_in_trading.md), emotions, and individual differences have significant effects on how individuals make intertemporal choices.

One key behavioral aspect is *present bias*, where individuals disproportionately prioritize immediate rewards over future benefits. This bias often leads to procrastination, under-saving for retirement, and other behaviors detrimental to long-term [welfare](../w/welfare.md).

Another crucial [factor](../f/factor.md) is *time inconsistency*, where preferences change over time in ways that are not predictable by exponential [discounting](../d/discounting.md) models. This is particularly evident in cases of addiction or other habitual behaviors, where short-term impulses override long-term plans.

## Applications in Finance

Intertemporal choice has profound implications for financial behavior and decision making. Here are some key applications:

### Savings and Retirement Planning

Understanding intertemporal choice helps explain why individuals often save less for retirement than would be optimal. Present bias and hyperbolic [discounting](../d/discounting.md) lead to undervaluation of future benefits, resulting in insufficient long-term savings. Financial planners and policymakers may use insights from intertemporal choice to design interventions, such as automatic enrollment in retirement plans and employer matching contributions, to promote better savings behavior.

### Consumption Smoothing

Consumption smoothing refers to the practice of optimizing consumption over time to maintain a stable [standard of living](../s/standard_of_living.md). Intertemporal choice models help explain how individuals allocate resources throughout their [life cycle](../l/life_cycle.md) in response to changing [income](../i/income.md) and needs. By modeling preferences and [discount](../d/discount.md) rates, economists can predict saving and borrowing behaviors, thereby informing effective fiscal policies and financial products.

### Investment Decisions

Intertemporal choice plays a critical role in investment decisions, where individuals must balance immediate risks and returns against long-term growth potentials. Understanding how people [discount](../d/discount.md) future returns can help financial advisors craft portfolios that align with clients' time preferences and [risk profiles](../r/risk_profiles.md).

## Policy Implications

Insights into intertemporal choice can inform policies aimed at improving public [welfare](../w/welfare.md). For instance, understanding how people [value](../v/value.md) future health can guide interventions in public health, such as promoting preventive care and vaccination programs. In environmental policy, models of intertemporal choice help assess the effectiveness of incentives for sustainable practices.

### Public Health

By recognizing the present bias in health-related decisions, policymakers can design programs that make long-term health benefits more salient and accessible. For example, providing immediate rewards for healthy behaviors or making future costs (e.g., penalties for unhealthy choices) more immediate can encourage better health practices.

### Environmental Sustainability

Intertemporal choice influences behaviors around resource use and environmental conservation. Policies that address the undervaluation of long-term environmental benefits, such as carbon pricing or subsidies for renewable energy, can encourage sustainable practices. Behavioral nudges, such as framing environmental actions in terms of immediate benefits (e.g., lower energy bills), can also enhance compliance and support for environmental initiatives.

## Conclusion

Intertemporal choice is a multifaceted concept that integrates economic theory, psychology, and behavioral science to explain how individuals make [trade](../t/trade.md)-offs over time. By understanding the various models and behavioral influences that shape intertemporal decisions, we can better predict financial behaviors, design effective policies, and enhance individual and societal [welfare](../w/welfare.md).

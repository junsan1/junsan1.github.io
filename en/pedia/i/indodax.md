Indodax provides a secure and user-friendly venue for users to buy and sell a wide variety of cryptocurrencies. It is an essential player in the cryptocurrency market for both Indonesian citizens and other global users, with over 5 million registered members as of 2023.

The platform supports trading of various cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and a large number of altcoins.

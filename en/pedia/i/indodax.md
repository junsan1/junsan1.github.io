Indodax is the largest and most comprehensive digital [asset](../a/asset.md) [exchange](../e/exchange.md) based in Indonesia. Originally known as [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md).co.id, the platform rebranded to Indodax (Indonesia Digital [Asset](../a/asset.md) [Exchange](../e/exchange.md)) in March 2018. Indodax provides a secure and user-friendly venue for users to buy and sell a [wide variety](../w/wide_variety.md) of cryptocurrencies. It is an essential player in the cryptocurrency [market](../m/market.md) for both Indonesian citizens and other global users, with over 5 million registered members as of 2023.

The platform supports trading of various cryptocurrencies including [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) (BTC), [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) (ETH), [Ripple](../r/ripple.md) (XRP), and a large number of altcoins. Indodax also facilitates trading with the Indonesian Rupiah (IDR), making it easier for local users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies using their native [currency](../c/currency.md).

## Platform Features

### Security Measures
[Security](../s/security.md) is a primary concern for any digital [asset](../a/asset.md) [exchange](../e/exchange.md). Indodax implements advanced [security](../s/security.md) measures such as two-[factor](../f/factor.md) authentication (2FA), encrypted communication, and cold storage for the majority of its digital assets.

### FIAT-to-Crypto and Crypto-to-Crypto Trading
One of the key features of Indodax is the ability to [trade](../t/trade.md) directly between Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) and various cryptocurrencies.

In addition to FIAT-to-crypto trading pairs, Indodax also supports numerous crypto-to-crypto trading pairs.

### Liquidity

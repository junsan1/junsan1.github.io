## Algorithmic Trading Strategies

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) encompasses a variety of strategies aimed at optimizing trade execution and maximizing profits. Key strategies include:

### 1. **Market Making**:
[Market making algorithms](../m/market_making_algorithms.md) place both buy and sell orders to profit from the [bid-ask spread](../b/bid-ask_spread.md). These algorithms constantly update quotes and manage inventory to provide liquidity and minimize risk.

### 2. **Trend Following**:
Trend-following algorithms identify and capitalize on market momentum by initiating trades in the direction of the prevailing trend. These strategies often utilize [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) such as moving averages and [momentum oscillators](../m/momentum_oscillators.md).

### 3. **Statistical Arbitrage**:
Statistical [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) exploits price inefficiencies between related financial instruments. These algorithms leverage statistical models to identify temporary divergences and execute trades to capture [mean reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md).

### 4. **Mean Reversion**:
[Mean reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md) strategies assume that asset prices will revert to their historical averages. Algorithms identify overbought or oversold conditions and place trades to profit from price corrections.

### 5. **Event-Driven**:
Event-driven algorithms react to market-moving events such as [earnings announcements](../e/earnings_announcements.md), economic data releases, or geopolitical developments. These algorithms analyze news feeds and market data in real-time to execute trades based on predicted market impact.

## Technology and Infrastructure

# Index Options

### Introduction
[Index](../i/index.md) [options](../o/options.md) are financial [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a basket of [stocks](../s/stock.md) represented by a specific [index](../i/index.md) at a predetermined price before or on a specified [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md). Unlike stock [options](../o/options.md) which are based on individual assets, [index](../i/index.md) [options](../o/options.md) are based on an entire [index](../i/index.md) such as the S&P 500, [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md)-100, or the Dow Jones Industrial Average. These instruments are widely used for hedging, [speculation](../s/speculation.md), and [portfolio management](../p/portfolio_management.md).

### Types of Index Options
There are two primary types of [index](../i/index.md) [options](../o/options.md):

1. **Call [Options](../o/options.md):** These give the holder the right to buy the [index](../i/index.md) at a specified [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).
2. **[Put Options](../p/put_options.md):** These give the holder the right to sell the [index](../i/index.md) at a specified [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).

### Major Index Options
Here are some of the most commonly traded [index](../i/index.md) [options](../o/options.md):

1. **S&P 500 [Index](../i/index.md) [Options](../o/options.md) (SPX):** These [options](../o/options.md) are based on the S&P 500 [index](../i/index.md), which consists of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the U.S.
2. **[NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md)-100 [Index](../i/index.md) [Options](../o/options.md) (NDX):** These [options](../o/options.md) are based on the [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md)-100 [index](../i/index.md), which includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies [listed](../l/listed.md) on the [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md) stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md).
3. **Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) [Options](../o/options.md) (DJX):** These are [options](../o/options.md) on the DJIA, an [index](../i/index.md) representing 30 large, publicly-owned companies based in the U.S.

### Pricing and Valuation
The [valuation](../v/valuation.md) of [index](../i/index.md) [options](../o/options.md) is driven by several factors, primarily:

1. **Spot [Index](../i/index.md) Level:** The current level of the [index](../i/index.md).
2. **[Strike Price](../s/strike_price.md):** The price at which the option can be exercised.
3. **Time to Expiration:** The remaining time until the [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md).
4. **[Volatility](../v/volatility.md):** The expected [volatility](../v/volatility.md) of the [index](../i/index.md) prices.
5. **[Risk](../r/risk.md)-Free [Interest Rate](../i/interest_rate.md):** The current [risk](../r/risk.md)-free [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md), typically the [yield](../y/yield.md) on government bonds.
6. **Dividends:** Expected dividends from the [index](../i/index.md) components.

The [Black-Scholes model](../b/black-scholes_model.md) and the Binomial model are commonly used to price [index](../i/index.md) [options](../o/options.md).

### Settlement of Index Options
[Index](../i/index.md) [options](../o/options.md) are typically cash-settled, which means that upon expiration, the difference between the [index](../i/index.md) price and the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) is paid in cash. The settlement can be:

1. **European-style:** Exercisable only at expiration.
2. **American-style:** Exercisable at any point before expiration.

### Popular Strategies
Traders use various strategies to [profit](../p/profit.md) from or [hedge](../h/hedge.md) using [index](../i/index.md) [options](../o/options.md), including:

1. **Covered Calls:** Holding the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) and selling a [call option](../c/call_option.md).
2. **Protective Puts:** Holding the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) and buying a [put option](../p/put.md).
3. **Straddles:** Buying both a call and a put at the same [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) and expiration.
4. **[Spreads](../s/spreads.md):** Simultaneously buying and selling [options](../o/options.md) of the same type with different strike prices or expiration dates.

# Inflation-Linked Bonds

[Inflation](../i/inflation.md)-linked bonds (ILBs), also known as [inflation](../i/inflation.md)-indexed bonds or real [return](../r/return.md) bonds, are a type of government or corporate [debt security](../d/debt_security.md) that provides investors with protection against [inflation](../i/inflation.md). Unlike traditional bonds, where the [interest](../i/interest.md) payments (coupons) and [principal](../p/principal.md) are fixed and may lose [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) over time due to [inflation](../i/inflation.md), ILBs are structured so that their payments adjust for [inflation](../i/inflation.md), which can preserve the real [value](../v/value.md) of an [investor](../i/investor.md)'s [capital](../c/capital.md).

## Types of Inflation-Linked Bonds

### Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)
In the United States, the most well-known [inflation](../i/inflation.md)-linked bonds are Treasury [Inflation-Protected Securities](../i/inflation-protected_securities.md) (TIPS). TIPS are issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and are indexed to the Consumer Price [Index](../i/index.md) (CPI), which measures [inflation](../i/inflation.md). Full details of TIPS can be found on the [U.S. Treasury's website](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/tips/res_tips.htm).

### UK Index-Linked Gilts
In the United Kingdom, [inflation](../i/inflation.md)-linked bonds are known as [Index](../i/index.md)-Linked [Gilts](../g/gilts.md). These bonds are issued by the UK [Debt](../d/debt.md) Management Office (DMO) and are linked to the Retail Price [Index](../i/index.md) (RPI). You can access more information about [Index](../i/index.md)-Linked [Gilts](../g/gilts.md) on the [UK DMO website](https://www.dmo.gov.uk/).

### Euro Inflation-Linked Bonds
Within the [Eurozone](../e/eurozone.md), numerous countries [issue](../i/issue.md) [inflation](../i/inflation.md)-linked bonds, and they are generally indexed to the Harmonized [Index](../i/index.md) of Consumer Prices (HICP). For example, the French government issues [Obligations](../o/obligation.md) Assimilables du Trésor (OATi), which can be explored further on the [Agence France Trésor website](https://www.aft.gouv.fr/en).

## Mechanics of Inflation-Linked Bonds

### Principal Adjustment
The [principal](../p/principal.md) amount of an ILB is adjusted periodically to reflect changes in the price [index](../i/index.md) it is linked to. For instance, if the CPI or RPI increases, the [principal](../p/principal.md) amount of the [bond](../b/bond.md) [will](../w/will.md) increase proportionally. Conversely, if there is [deflation](../d/deflation.md), the [principal](../p/principal.md) amount [will](../w/will.md) decrease. However, many ILBs come with a [deflation](../d/deflation.md) floor ensuring that the [principal](../p/principal.md) does not fall below its original [value](../v/value.md).

### Coupon Payments
The coupon [payment](../p/payment.md) of an ILB is typically calculated based on the adjusted [principal](../p/principal.md). Therefore, as the [principal](../p/principal.md) increases with [inflation](../i/inflation.md), the [interest](../i/interest.md) payments also increase, providing a [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

### Maturity Value
Upon [maturity](../m/maturity.md), the [bondholder](../b/bondholder.md) receives the higher of the [original face](../o/original_face.md) [value](../v/value.md) or the [inflation](../i/inflation.md)-adjusted [principal](../p/principal.md). This feature ensures that the real [value](../v/value.md) of the [bondholder](../b/bondholder.md)'s investment is preserved even in the event of [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

## Benefits of Investing in Inflation-Linked Bonds

### Inflation Protection
The primary benefit of ILBs is the protection they [offer](../o/offer.md) against [inflation](../i/inflation.md). For investors concerned about the eroding effect of [inflation](../i/inflation.md) on [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md), ILBs provide a mechanism to maintain real [value](../v/value.md) over time.

### Diversification
ILBs can provide [diversification](../d/diversification.md) within a fixed-[income](../i/income.md) portfolio. Because their returns are linked to [inflation](../i/inflation.md), they may perform differently from traditional bonds, whose returns are more directly impacted by changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

### Government Backing
Most [inflation](../i/inflation.md)-linked bonds are issued by sovereign governments and carry the [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) associated with the issuing country. For instance, TIPS are backed by the full faith and [credit](../c/credit.md) of the U.S. government, making them a low-[risk](../r/risk.md) investment.

## Risks Associated with Inflation-Linked Bonds

### Interest Rate Risk
ILBs are not immune to [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md). Rising [interest](../i/interest.md) rates typically lead to falling [bond](../b/bond.md) prices. However, because the [principal](../p/principal.md) is adjusted for [inflation](../i/inflation.md), the price [volatility](../v/volatility.md) of ILBs may be lower compared to [nominal](../n/nominal.md) bonds.

### Inflation Risk
Although ILBs are designed to protect against [inflation](../i/inflation.md), there is still a [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with the method of measuring [inflation](../i/inflation.md). If the [index](../i/index.md) used to adjust the ILB does not accurately reflect the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s experience of [inflation](../i/inflation.md), the protection might be inadequate.

### Tax Considerations
In some jurisdictions, the [inflation](../i/inflation.md) adjustments to the [principal](../p/principal.md) of an ILB can be taxable, even though the [investor](../i/investor.md) does not receive the adjustment amount until the [bond](../b/bond.md) matures. This can result in a higher tax burden compared to [nominal](../n/nominal.md) bonds.

## Notable Issuers of Inflation-Linked Bonds

### U.S. Department of the Treasury
The U.S. Department of the Treasury is the primary [issuer](../i/issuer.md) of TIPS. Investors can buy TIPS directly from the Treasury through the [TreasuryDirect website](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/).

### UK Debt Management Office
The UK DMO manages the issuance of [Index](../i/index.md)-Linked [Gilts](../g/gilts.md). Detailed information can be found on the [DMO website](https://www.dmo.gov.uk/).

### Agence France Trésor
Agence France Trésor is responsible for the issuance of French [inflation](../i/inflation.md)-linked bonds, including OATi. Their resources are available on their official [website](https://www.aft.gouv.fr/).

## Investing in Inflation-Linked Bonds

### Primary Market
Investors can acquire ILBs directly from the government through auctions. This is often done via platforms like TreasuryDirect in the U.S. or through national Investment Saving Accounts (ISAs) in other countries.

### Secondary Market
ILBs can also be purchased on the [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md) through brokers or financial institutions. [Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) in the [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md) can vary depending on the specific [bond](../b/bond.md) and the [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

### Mutual Funds and ETFs
Investors can [gain](../g/gain.md) exposure to ILBs through mutual funds or [exchange](../e/exchange.md)-traded funds (ETFs) that specialize in [inflation](../i/inflation.md)-linked securities. These funds provide a diversified portfolio of ILBs, which can reduce individual [bond](../b/bond.md) [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Consideration of Inflation Projections
Before [investing](../i/investing.md) in ILBs, investors should consider [inflation](../i/inflation.md) projections and how they align with their investment goals. For instance, if low [inflation](../i/inflation.md) is expected, [nominal](../n/nominal.md) bonds might [offer](../o/offer.md) better returns. However, if high [inflation](../i/inflation.md) is anticipated, ILBs could provide superior protection.

## Tips for Investors

### Understand the Index
It's crucial to understand the [index](../i/index.md) your ILB is linked to. Different countries use different indices (CPI, RPI, HICP), and the choice of [index](../i/index.md) can impact the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s performance.

### Monitor Inflation Trends
Keeping an eye on [inflation](../i/inflation.md) trends can help investors decide when to invest in ILBs. Rising [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rates make ILBs more valuable, while falling [inflation](../i/inflation.md) might decrease their attractiveness.

### Consider Tax Implications
Investors should be mindful of the tax implications of ILBs. Consulting with a tax advisor can provide better insights into how [taxation](../t/taxation.md) on [principal](../p/principal.md) adjustments and [interest](../i/interest.md) payments [will](../w/will.md) affect overall returns.

### Diversify
While ILBs [offer](../o/offer.md) [inflation](../i/inflation.md) protection, they should be part of a diversified [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md). Including a mix of traditional bonds, ILBs, equities, and other [asset](../a/asset.md) classes can help manage risks and enhance returns.

## Conclusion

[Inflation](../i/inflation.md)-Linked Bonds [offer](../o/offer.md) a unique investment opportunity for those looking to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against [inflation](../i/inflation.md). By providing returns that adjust with [inflation](../i/inflation.md), ILBs help preserve the [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) of an [investor](../i/investor.md)'s [capital](../c/capital.md). However, like any investment, they come with their own set of risks and considerations. Understanding the mechanics of these bonds, the benefits they [offer](../o/offer.md), and the risks they entail is crucial for making informed investment decisions. Whether purchased directly or through financial instruments like mutual funds and ETFs, ILBs can play a crucial role in a well-rounded investment portfolio.

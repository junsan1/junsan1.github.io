# Investment Management

Investment management is a comprehensive term referring to the professional management of various securities (such as [shares](../s/shares.md), bonds, and other assets) and other assets (e.g., [real estate](../r/real_estate.md)) to meet specified investment goals for the benefit of investors. These investors may be institutions ([insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies, pension funds, corporations, charities, educational establishments, etc.) or private investors (both directly via investment contracts and more commonly via collective investment schemes like mutual funds or [exchange](../e/exchange.md)-traded funds).

## Key Concepts in Investment Management

### Portfolio Management

[Portfolio management](../p/par.md) is the heart of investment management. A [portfolio manager](../p/portfolio_manager.md)'s job is to assemble and manage a collection of investments that meet the long-term financial goals and [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) of the client. This involves deciding on [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md), selecting individual securities, and ongoing monitoring of the portfolio.

**[Asset Allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md):**
[Asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) involves dividing an investment portfolio among different [asset](../a/asset.md) categories, such as [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, and cash. Each [asset class](../a/asset_class.md) has different levels of [return](../r/return.md) and [risk](../r/risk.md), so the allocation [will](../w/will.md) depend on the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md), investment goals, and investment time frame.

**[Security Selection](../s/security_selection.md):**
[Security selection](../s/security_selection.md) is the process of choosing individual securities within a certain [asset class](../a/asset_class.md). This process involves both quantitative methods (e.g., financial models, algorithms) and [qualitative analysis](../q/qualitative_analysis.md) (e.g., the companyâ€™s [business](../b/business.md) model, management quality).

### Risk Management

[Risk management](../r/risk_management.md) in investment management is the process of understanding, analyzing, and addressing potential risks to ensure that investment goals are achieved with the minimized potential losses. [Risk management](../r/risk_management.md) strategies may include [diversification](../d/diversification.md), hedging, and [portfolio rebalancing](../p/portfolio_rebalancing.md).

**[Diversification](../d/diversification.md):**
[Diversification](../d/diversification.md) is a [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) technique that mixes a [wide variety](../w/wide_variety.md) of investments within a portfolio. The rationale behind this technique is that a diversified portfolio [will](../w/will.md), on average, [yield](../y/yield.md) higher returns and pose a lower [risk](../r/risk.md) than any individual investment found within the portfolio.

**Hedging:**
Hedging is an investment designed to reduce the [risk](../r/risk.md) of adverse price movements in an [asset](../a/asset.md). Typically, a [hedge](../h/hedge.md) consists of taking an offsetting position in a related [security](../s/security.md), such as a [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md).

### Quantitative Investment Management

Quantitative investment management involves using [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md) and algorithms to make investment decisions. These models attempt to understand [market](../m/market.md) behavior and predict stock price movements. This approach often includes:

**High-Frequency Trading (HFT):**
A type of [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) characterized by high speeds, high [turnover](../t/turnover.md) rates, and high [order](../o/order.md)-to-[trade](../t/trade.md) ratios. HFT uses sophisticated algorithms to exploit trading inefficiencies that exist for very short durations.

**[Factor](../f/factor.md)-Based [Investing](../i/investing.md):**
An [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) that uses quantifiable characteristics (factors) to explain differences in stock returns. Factors like [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md), [value](../v/value.md) indicators, and [momentum](../m/momentum.md) are commonly used in [quantitative models](../q/quantitative_models.md).

### Performance Measurement

Performance measurement is crucial to assess whether investment goals are being met. Key [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md) include:

**[Absolute Return](../a/absolute_return.md):**
The [return](../r/return.md) that an [asset](../a/asset.md) achieves over a certain period of time. It's measured as the percentage [gain](../g/gain.md) or loss and does not consider the [risk](../r/risk.md) taken.

**Relative [Return](../r/return.md):**
The [return](../r/return.md) of an investment compared to the [return](../r/return.md) of a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) or [market index](../m/market_index.md). This is often used to gauge [fund manager](../f/fund_manager.md) performance.

**[Risk](../r/risk.md)-Adjusted Returns:**
Returns that have been adjusted for the [risk](../r/risk.md) taken. Common [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted metrics are the [Sharpe ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md), [Treynor ratio](../t/treynor_ratio.md), and [alpha](../a/alpha.md).

### Ethical and Responsible Investing

Ethical and responsible investment involves integrating personal values or societal concerns into investment decision-making. This includes investments in companies that adhere to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria.

**Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG):**
[Investing](../i/investing.md) based on how well a company performs concerning environmental protection, [social responsibility](../s/social_responsibility.md), and governance. Investors might avoid companies with poor labor practices or environmental records while seeking companies that have positive impacts.

**[Impact Investing](../i/impact_investing.md):**
[Impact investing](../i/impact_investing.md) involves making investments with the intention to generate social or environmental impact alongside a financial [return](../r/return.md). One well-known example is [microfinance](../m/microfinance.md), which aims to provide financial services to underserved markets.

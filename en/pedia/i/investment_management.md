# Investment Management

Investment management is a comprehensive term referring to the professional management of various securities (such as shares, bonds, and other assets) and other assets (e.g., real estate) to meet specified investment goals for the benefit of investors. These investors may be institutions (insurance companies, pension funds, corporations, charities, educational establishments, etc.) or private investors (both directly via investment contracts and more commonly via collective investment schemes like mutual funds or exchange-traded funds).

## Key Concepts in Investment Management

### Portfolio Management

Portfolio management is the heart of investment management. A portfolio manager's job is to assemble and manage a collection of investments that meet the long-term financial goals and risk tolerance of the client. This involves deciding on asset allocation, selecting individual securities, and ongoing monitoring of the portfolio.

**Asset Allocation:**
Asset allocation involves dividing an investment portfolio among different asset categories, such as stocks, bonds, and cash. Each asset class has different levels of return and risk, so the allocation will depend on the investor's risk tolerance, investment goals, and investment time frame.

**Security Selection:**
Security selection is the process of choosing individual securities within a certain asset class. This process involves both quantitative methods (e.g., financial models, algorithms) and qualitative analysis (e.g., the companyâ€™s business model, management quality).

### Risk Management

Risk management in investment management is the process of understanding, analyzing, and addressing potential risks to ensure that investment goals are achieved with the minimized potential losses. Risk management strategies may include diversification, hedging, and portfolio rebalancing.

**Diversification:**
Diversification is a risk management technique that mixes a wide variety of investments within a portfolio. The rationale behind this technique is that a diversified portfolio will, on average, yield higher returns and pose a lower risk than any individual investment found within the portfolio.

**Hedging:**
Hedging is an investment designed to reduce the risk of adverse price movements in an asset. Typically, a hedge consists of taking an offsetting position in a related security, such as a futures contract.

### Quantitative Investment Management

Quantitative investment management involves using mathematical models and algorithms to make investment decisions. These models attempt to understand market behavior and predict stock price movements. This approach often includes:

**High-Frequency Trading (HFT):**
A type of algorithmic trading characterized by high speeds, high turnover rates, and high order-to-trade ratios. HFT uses sophisticated algorithms to exploit trading inefficiencies that exist for very short durations.

**Factor-Based Investing:**
An investment strategy that uses quantifiable characteristics (factors) to explain differences in stock returns. Factors like market capitalization, value indicators, and momentum are commonly used in quantitative models.

### Performance Measurement

Performance measurement is crucial to assess whether investment goals are being met. Key performance metrics include:

**Absolute Return:**
The return that an asset achieves over a certain period of time. It's measured as the percentage gain or loss and does not consider the risk taken.

**Relative Return:**
The return of an investment compared to the return of a benchmark or market index. This is often used to gauge fund manager performance.

**Risk-Adjusted Returns:**
Returns that have been adjusted for the risk taken. Common risk-adjusted metrics are the Sharpe ratio, Treynor ratio, and alpha.

### Ethical and Responsible Investing

Ethical and responsible investment involves integrating personal values or societal concerns into investment decision-making. This includes investments in companies that adhere to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria.

**Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG):**
Investing based on how well a company performs concerning environmental protection, social responsibility, and governance. Investors might avoid companies with poor labor practices or environmental records while seeking companies that have positive impacts.

**Impact Investing:**
Impact investing involves making investments with the intention to generate social or environmental impact alongside a financial return. One well-known example is microfinance, which aims to provide financial services to underserved markets.

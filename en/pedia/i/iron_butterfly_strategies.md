# Iron Butterfly Strategies

## Introduction
The [Iron Butterfly](../i/iron_butterfly.md), often referred to simply as the "Iron Fly," is a popular [options](../o/options.md) [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) used by traders to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on a narrow [range](../r/range.md) in the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). This strategy is a combination of a [bull put spread](../b/bull_put_spread.md) and a [bear call spread](../b/bear_call_spread.md). The [Iron Butterfly](../i/iron_butterfly.md) is a [market](../m/market.md)-[neutral](../n/neutral.md) strategy, meaning it can be profitable in scenarios where the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock does not move significantly.

## Components of an Iron Butterfly
An [Iron Butterfly](../i/iron_butterfly.md) strategy consists of four [options](../o/options.md):
1. Buy one out-of-the-[money](../m/money.md) put (lower [strike price](../s/strike_price.md)).
2. Sell one at-the-[money](../m/money.md) put (middle [strike price](../s/strike_price.md)).
3. Sell one at-the-[money](../m/money.md) call (middle [strike price](../s/strike_price.md)).
4. Buy one out-of-the-[money](../m/money.md) call (higher [strike price](../s/strike_price.md)).

The at-the-[money](../m/money.md) (ATM) put and call [options](../o/options.md) are at the same [strike price](../s/strike_price.md), which is typically close to the current price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). These middle strike [options](../o/options.md) are the core of the [Iron Butterfly](../i/iron_butterfly.md), as they define the [range](../r/range.md) within which the strategy profits.

## Construction of an Iron Butterfly
To construct an [Iron Butterfly](../i/iron_butterfly.md), follow these steps:
1. **Select the [Underlying Asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)**: Choose the stock or [index](../i/index_instrument.md) you believe [will](../w/will.md) not exhibit large price movements during the [options](../o/options.md)' lifespan.
2. **Determine the [Expiration Date](../e/expiration_date.md)**: Pick an [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md) for the [options](../o/options.md) contracts based on your forecast for the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).
3. **Choose the Middle [Strike Price](../s/strike_price.md)**: Select the at-the-[money](../m/money.md) [strike price](../s/strike_price.md), which is close to the current [market price](../m/market_price.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).
4. **Establish the Wing Width**: Decide on the strike prices for the [out-of-the-money options](../o/out-of-the-money_options.md) (both call and put) that [will](../w/will.md) form the "wings" of the butterfly.

For example, if a stock is trading at $50:
- Buy one 45 put (out-of-the-[money](../m/money.md) put).
- Sell one 50 put (at-the-[money](../m/money.md) put).
- Sell one 50 call (at-the-[money](../m/money.md) call).
- Buy one 55 call (out-of-the-[money](../m/money.md) call).

## Risk and Reward Profile
- **Maximum [Profit](../p/profit.md)**: Occurs when the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price is at the middle strike (i.e., the at-the-[money](../m/money.md) strike) at expiration. The [profit](../p/profit.md) is limited to the net [credit](../c/credit.md) received when establishing the [Iron Butterfly](../i/iron_butterfly.md).
- **Maximum Loss**: Occurs when the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)â€™s price at expiration is below the lower [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of the put or above the higher [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of the call. The loss is limited to the difference between the lower/higher strikes and the middle strike minus the net [credit](../c/credit.md) received.
  
The breakeven points for the [Iron Butterfly](../i/iron_butterfly.md) are calculated as follows:
- Lower Breakeven: Middle [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) - Net [credit](../c/credit.md) received.
- Upper Breakeven: Middle [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) + Net [credit](../c/credit.md) received.

## Example
Consider an [Iron Butterfly](../i/iron_butterfly.md) with the following [options](../o/options.md):
- Buy 1 XYZ Dec 45 Put at $1
- Sell 1 XYZ Dec 50 Put at $3
- Sell 1 XYZ Dec 50 Call at $3
- Buy 1 XYZ Dec 55 Call at $1

The net [credit](../c/credit.md) received is ($3 + $3) - ($1 + $1) = $4.

- **Maximum [Profit](../p/profit.md)**: Achieved if XYZ closes at $50 at expiration. [Profit](../p/profit.md) = $4.
- **Maximum Loss**: Occurs below $45 or above $55. Loss = ($5 - $4) = $1.

## Adjustments and Variations
Sometimes traders need to adjust their [Iron Butterfly](../i/iron_butterfly.md) positions to manage [risk](../r/risk.md) or enhance profitability. Possible adjustments include:
- **Rolling**: Moving the entire position to a different expiration or strike prices.
- **Unwinding**: Closing one or more legs of the [Iron Butterfly](../i/iron_butterfly.md) to convert it into a different strategy, such as a [vertical spread](../v/vertical_spread.md) or an [Iron Condor](../i/iron_condor.md).

## Iron Butterfly vs. Iron Condor
Both the [Iron Butterfly](../i/iron_butterfly.md) and [Iron Condor](../i/iron_condor.md) strategies are similar; however, there are key differences:
- **[Iron Butterfly](../i/iron_butterfly.md)**: Uses at-the-[money](../m/money.md) [options](../o/options.md) for the short strikes, resulting in a higher net [credit](../c/credit.md) but narrower [profit](../p/profit.md) [range](../r/range.md).
- **[Iron Condor](../i/iron_condor.md)**: Utilizes [out-of-the-money options](../o/out-of-the-money_options.md) for the short strikes, yielding a lower net [credit](../c/credit.md) but a wider [profit](../p/profit.md) [range](../r/range.md).

## Tax Implications
The [Iron Butterfly](../i/iron_butterfly.md) strategy may have tax implications, as option trading can be subject to short-term [capital gains tax](../c/capital_gains_tax.md) rules in most jurisdictions. It is crucial for traders to consult with tax professionals to understand the specific tax impacts on their trading activities.

## Conclusion

By understanding the components, construction, [risk](../r/risk.md) and reward profiles, and potential adjustments, traders can effectively utilize this strategy to enhance their trading portfolios. However, as with any [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md), it comes with inherent risks and requires thorough analysis and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md).

# Investment Product

An investment product is a financial product that individuals and institutions purchase to increase their wealth through appreciation, interest, or income payments. Investment products come in various forms, each with its own characteristics, benefits, risks, and intended purposes. This detailed guide will explore different types of investment products, providing an overview and insight into their structures, how they work, and their typical user base.

## Equities (Stocks)

Equities, commonly referred to as stocks, represent ownership in a company. When an investor buys a company's stock, they essentially purchase a small part of the firm. Equities are one of the most popular investment products due to their potential for high returns via capital appreciation and dividends.

# Investment Product

An investment product is a financial product that individuals and institutions purchase to increase their [wealth](../w/wealth.md) through appreciation, [interest](../i/interest.md), or [income](../i/income.md) payments. Investment products come in various forms, each with its own characteristics, benefits, risks, and intended purposes. This detailed guide [will](../w/will.md) explore different types of investment products, providing an overview and insight into their structures, how they work, and their typical user base.

## Equities (Stocks)

Equities, commonly referred to as [stocks](../s/stock.md), represent ownership in a company. When an [investor](../i/investor.md) buys a company's stock, they essentially purchase a small part of the [firm](../f/firm.md). Equities are one of the most popular investment products due to their potential for high returns via [capital](../c/capital.md) appreciation and dividends.

### How They Work

[Stocks](../s/stock.md) are traded on stock exchanges like the New York Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (NYSE) or [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md). Investors can buy [shares](../s/shares.md) through brokerage accounts. The price of a stock fluctuates based on factors such as company performance, [market](../m/market.md) conditions, and [investor](../i/investor.md) sentiment.

### Advantages

- **[Capital](../c/capital.md) Appreciation**: Potential for significant price increases over time.
- **Dividends**: Regular [income](../i/income.md) in the form of [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payments.
- **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)**: [Stocks](../s/stock.md) can be easily sold and converted into cash.

### Risks

- **[Market Risk](../m/market_risk.md)**: [Stocks](../s/stock.md) are subject to [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and can lead to loss of [capital](../c/capital.md).
- **Company-Specific [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: Poor performance or management can negatively impact stock [value](../v/value.md).

### Typical Investors

- **Individual Investors**: Both short-term traders and long-term investors.
- **Institutional Investors**: [Hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds, pension funds, and mutual funds.

## Bonds

Bonds are fixed-[income](../i/income.md) securities issued by corporations, municipalities, or governments to raise [capital](../c/capital.md). They promise to pay back the [principal](../p/principal.md) along with [interest](../i/interest.md) at specified intervals.

### How They Work

Investors purchase bonds, effectively lending [money](../m/money.md) to the [issuer](../i/issuer.md). In [return](../r/return.md), they receive periodic [interest](../i/interest.md) payments and the [return](../r/return.md) of the [bond](../b/bond.md)â€™s [face value](../f/face_value.md) upon [maturity](../m/maturity.md).

### Advantages

- **[Fixed Income](../f/fixed_income.md)**: Predictable and regular [interest](../i/interest.md) payments.
- **Lower [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: Generally considered safer than [stocks](../s/stock.md).
- **Diverse [Options](../o/options.md)**: Government bonds, corporate bonds, [municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md), etc.

### Risks

- **[Credit Risk](../c/credit_risk.md)**: The [issuer](../i/issuer.md) may [default](../d/default.md) on payments.
- **[Interest Rate Risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md)**: Rising [interest](../i/interest.md) rates can decrease [bond](../b/bond.md) prices.
- **[Inflation](../i/inflation.md) [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: [Inflation](../i/inflation.md) can erode the [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) of fixed payments.

### Typical Investors

- **[Risk-Averse](../r/risk-averse.md) Individuals**: Investors looking for stable [income](../i/income.md).
- **Institutions**: Pension funds, [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies, and mutual funds.

## Mutual Funds

Mutual funds pool [money](../m/money.md) from [multiple](../m/multiple.md) investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, or other securities.

### How They Work

A professional [fund manager](../f/fund_manager.md) oversees a [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md) and makes investment decisions on behalf of the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s investors. Mutual funds may focus on specific sectors, geographies, or [asset](../a/asset.md) types.

### Advantages

- **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: Spread investments across various assets to manage [risk](../r/risk.md).

- **Retirement Accounts**: Like 401(k)s and IRAs.

## Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)

### How They Work

Investors buy [shares](../s/shares.md) of an ETF through brokerage accounts. ETFs employ various strategies, including passive ([index](../i/index.md)-tracking) and [active management](../a/active_management.md).

### Advantages

- **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)**: Can be bought and sold like [stocks](../s/stock.md).
- **Lower Costs**: Generally have lower fees than mutual funds.
- **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: [Offer](../o/offer.md) broad [market exposure](../m/market_exposure.md).

### Risks

### How They Work

[Options](../o/options.md) contracts can be classified as calls (the right to buy) or puts (the right to sell). They are used for hedging, [speculation](../s/speculation.md), or [income](../i/income.md) generation.

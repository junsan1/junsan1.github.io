# International Depository Receipt (IDR)

## Introduction
An International [Depository](../d/depository.md) Receipt (IDR) is a [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) used to facilitate the trading of [shares](../s/shares.md) of foreign companies on domestic stock exchanges. Through this mechanism, investors can buy [shares](../s/shares.md) of a company that is based in another country without dealing with the complexities of [foreign exchange](../f/foreign_exchange.md) regulations or the difficulties of cross-border transactions.

IDRs are issued by [depository](../d/depository.md) banks and represent a specific number of [shares](../s/shares.md) in a foreign company that is held in [trust](../t/trust.md). Essentially, they serve as [negotiable](../n/negotiable.md) certificates that denote ownership of a given number of [shares](../s/shares.md) in a foreign company. The concept is similar to American [Depository](../d/depository.md) [Receipts](../r/receipt.md) (ADRs) or Global [Depository](../d/depository.md) [Receipts](../r/receipt.md) (GDRs), but whereas ADRs are specifically for the U.S. [market](../m/market.md), and GDRs are for [multiple](../m/multiple.md) markets, IDRs can apply more broadly to any international [market](../m/market.md).

## Mechanism of IDR

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Selection of Foreign Company**: A [depository](../d/depository.md) [bank](../b/bank.md) selects a foreign company whose [shares](../s/shares.md) [will](../w/will.md) be represented by IDRs.
2. **Purchase and Custody**: The [depository](../d/depository.md) [bank](../b/bank.md) purchases a bulk amount of the foreign company's [shares](../s/shares.md) and holds them in a [custodial account](../c/custodial_account.md).
3. **Issuance of IDRs**: The [bank](../b/bank.md) then issues IDRs corresponding to the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [shares](../s/shares.md). The ratio may not be one-to-one; each IDR could represent a fraction or [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [shares](../s/shares.md) of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock.
4. **Trading**: These IDRs are then [listed](../l/listed.md) and traded on local stock exchanges, making them accessible to domestic investors.
5. **Conversion and [Redemption](../r/redemption.md)**: Investors can convert IDRs back into the original [shares](../s/shares.md) by presenting them to the [depository](../d/depository.md) [bank](../b/bank.md), which [will](../w/will.md) then deliver the corresponding number of foreign [shares](../s/shares.md).

## Benefits of IDRs

### For Investors
- **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: Offers the opportunity to invest in foreign companies without engaging in foreign transactions directly.
- **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)**: IDRs provide an easy way to [trade](../t/trade.md) in the equities of foreign companies through a familiar domestic [exchange](../e/exchange.md).
- **[Dividend](../d/dividend.md)**: Similar to regular [shares](../s/shares.md), IDRs fetch dividends which are usually converted into local [currency](../c/currency.md) by the [depository](../d/depository.md) [bank](../b/bank.md) before [distribution](../d/distribution.md).

### For Companies
- **Access to [Capital](../c/capital.md)**: Allows foreign companies to tap into the [capital markets](../c/capital_markets.md) of another country, raising funds without needing a local listing.
- **[Market](../m/market.md) [Expansion](../e/expansion.md)**: Enhances the [visibility](../v/visibility.md) and presence of the company in international markets.
- **[Investor](../i/investor.md) Base Broadening**: Attracts a wider [investor](../i/investor.md) base, thereby enhancing the potential for stock [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).

## Risks and Challenges

### Exchange Rate Risk
The dividends and [capital](../c/capital.md) gains from an IDR are subject to [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) fluctuations between the domestic [currency](../c/currency.md) and the [currency](../c/currency.md) of the [home](../h/home.md) country of the foreign [shares](../s/shares.md).

### Regulatory Risk
Investors are exposed to the regulatory framework and changes in both the domestic country and the foreign company's [home](../h/home.md) country, which can affect the performance and returns of IDRs.

### Liquidity Risk
While IDRs are meant to enhance [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), there can be periods when trading [volume](../v/volume.md) is low, affecting the ability to quickly buy or sell these instruments.

## Real-World Examples of IDR Usage

One of the most notable examples of IDRs is Infosys, an Indian [multinational corporation](../m/multinational_corporation.md) that has utilized IDRs to [gain](../g/gain.md) a presence in [multiple](../m/multiple.md) international markets. 

### Infosys IDRs
Infosys Limited, [listed](../l/listed.md) on the New York Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (NYSE) in the form of American [Depository](../d/depository.md) [Shares](../s/shares.md) (ADS), have equivalent International [Depository](../d/depository.md) [Receipts](../r/receipt.md) for investors in other countries looking to diversify into Indian [stocks](../s/stock.md) without the direct complexity of Indian [stock market](../s/stock_market.md) regulations.

### Case Study: SBI's IDRs
State [Bank](../b/bank.md) of India (SBI), another major Indian banking institution, launched its IDRs on the London Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md), aimed at attracting UK investors looking to invest in [robust](../r/robust.md) Indian financial institutions.

## Conclusion
International [Depository](../d/depository.md) [Receipts](../r/receipt.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) a valuable mechanism for investors seeking to diversify their portfolios with foreign equities while mitigating the hurdles associated with direct international investment. They also provide foreign companies a streamlined route to access domestic [capital markets](../c/capital_markets.md), thereby enhancing [capital](../c/capital.md) raising capabilities and [visibility](../v/visibility.md). Despite the evident advantages, potential risks such as [currency](../c/currency.md) fluctuations, regulatory changes, and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) constraints should be carefully considered.

The IDR [market](../m/market.md) continues to evolve with the dynamic global financial landscape, paving the way for increased international investments and cross-border financial activities.

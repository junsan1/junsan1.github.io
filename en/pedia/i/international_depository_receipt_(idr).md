# International Depository Receipt (IDR)

## Introduction
An International Depository Receipt (IDR) is a financial instrument used to facilitate the trading of shares of foreign companies on domestic stock exchanges. Through this mechanism, investors can buy shares of a company that is based in another country without dealing with the complexities of foreign exchange regulations or the difficulties of cross-border transactions.

IDRs are issued by depository banks and represent a specific number of shares in a foreign company that is held in trust. Essentially, they serve as negotiable certificates that denote ownership of a given number of shares in a foreign company. The concept is similar to American Depository Receipts (ADRs) or Global Depository Receipts (GDRs), but whereas ADRs are specifically for the U.S. market, and GDRs are for multiple markets, IDRs can apply more broadly to any international market.

## Mechanism of IDR

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Selection of Foreign Company**: A depository bank selects a foreign company whose shares will be represented by IDRs.
2. **Purchase and Custody**: The depository bank purchases a bulk amount of the foreign company's shares and holds them in a custodial account.
3. **Issuance of IDRs**: The bank then issues IDRs corresponding to the underlying shares. The ratio may not be one-to-one; each IDR could represent a fraction or multiple shares of the underlying stock.
4. **Trading**: These IDRs are then listed and traded on local stock exchanges, making them accessible to domestic investors.
5. **Conversion and Redemption**: Investors can convert IDRs back into the original shares by presenting them to the depository bank, which will then deliver the corresponding number of foreign shares.

## Benefits of IDRs

### For Investors
- **Diversification**: Offers the opportunity to invest in foreign companies without engaging in foreign transactions directly.
- **Liquidity**: IDRs provide an easy way to trade in the equities of foreign companies through a familiar domestic exchange.
- **Dividend**: Similar to regular shares, IDRs fetch dividends which are usually converted into local currency by the depository bank before distribution.

### For Companies
- **Access to Capital**: Allows foreign companies to tap into the capital markets of another country, raising funds without needing a local listing.
- **Market Expansion**: Enhances the visibility and presence of the company in international markets.
- **Investor Base Broadening**: Attracts a wider investor base, thereby enhancing the potential for stock liquidity.

## Risks and Challenges

### Exchange Rate Risk
The dividends and capital gains from an IDR are subject to exchange rate fluctuations between the domestic currency and the currency of the home country of the foreign shares.

### Regulatory Risk
Investors are exposed to the regulatory framework and changes in both the domestic country and the foreign company's home country, which can affect the performance and returns of IDRs.

### Liquidity Risk
While IDRs are meant to enhance liquidity, there can be periods when trading volume is low, affecting the ability to quickly buy or sell these instruments.

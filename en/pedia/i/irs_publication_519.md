# IRS Publication 519

IRS Publication 519, also known as the "U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens," is an informational and instructional document issued by the Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Service (IRS) of the United States. This publication provides important tax information for non-U.S. citizens and residents, commonly referred to as "aliens," who are subject to U.S. tax laws. It aims to help aliens understand their tax [obligations](../o/obligation.md), methodologies for determining resident status, and the intricacies of tax treaties between the U.S. and other countries to avoid [double taxation](../d/double_taxation.md). Below is a detailed description of the key components and topics covered in IRS Publication 519.

## Introduction to IRS Publication 519

The IRS Publication 519 begins with an introduction to the basic concepts of U.S. tax law as it pertains to aliens. The IRS categorizes individuals into two broad categories for tax purposes: resident aliens and nonresident aliens. The distinction between these two classifications is important as it determines the extent of tax [obligations](../o/obligation.md) an individual has in the U.S.

## The Concept of Alien Status

### Resident Alien

A [resident alien](../r/resident_alien.md) is an individual who meets either the "[Green Card](../g/green_card.md) Test" or the "Substantial Presence Test" for a given tax year. 

1. **[Green Card](../g/green_card.md) Test**: An individual is considered a [resident alien](../r/resident_alien.md) if they are a Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR) of the U.S. according to immigration laws. This status is evidenced by holding an alien registration card (commonly known as a [green card](../g/green_card.md)).

2. **Substantial Presence Test**: This test takes into account the number of days an individual is physically present in the U.S. over a three-year period. To meet this test, an individual must be present in the U.S. for at least 31 days during the current year and 183 days over the past three years, using a specific formula to calculate the total.

### Nonresident Alien

An individual who does not meet either the [Green Card](../g/green_card.md) Test or the Substantial Presence Test is considered a [nonresident alien](../n/nonresident_alien.md). Nonresident aliens are typically taxed only on their U.S.-sourced [income](../i/income.md) and not on their [worldwide income](../w/worldwide_income.md).

## Dual-Status Taxpayer

Publication 519 also covers the unique situation of "dual-status taxpayers." These are individuals who are both a [resident alien](../r/resident_alien.md) and a [nonresident alien](../n/nonresident_alien.md) during different parts of the same tax year. Dual-status taxpayers have unique filing requirements and need to file a dual-status [return](../r/return.md) to accurately report their [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md) for the periods they were resident and nonresident aliens.

## Tax Treaties

The guide provides information on tax treaties between the U.S. and other countries. These treaties are designed to avoid [double taxation](../d/double_taxation.md) and prevent [tax evasion](../t/tax_evasion.md). Such treaties can significantly affect the tax liabilities of aliens residing in the U.S. Under these treaties, reduced tax rates or exemptions can be applied to specific types of [income](../i/income.md), such as pensions, dividends, [interest](../i/interest.md), and royalties. It's essential for aliens to understand any applicable [tax treaty](../t/tax_treaty.md) benefits that may reduce their U.S. tax burden.

## Income Subject to Tax

### Resident Aliens

Resident aliens are subject to U.S. [income tax](../i/income_tax.md) on their [worldwide income](../w/worldwide_income.md), meaning they must report all [income](../i/income.md) from any source, both inside and outside of the U.S.

### Nonresident Aliens

Nonresident aliens generally report only their U.S. source [income](../i/income.md). This includes:

1. **Effectively Connected [Income](../i/income.md) (ECI)**: This is [income](../i/income.md) that is effectively connected with the conduct of a [trade](../t/trade.md) or [business](../b/business.md) in the U.S. ECI is taxed at the same graduated tax rates that apply to U.S. citizens and resident aliens.

2. **Non-Effectively Connected [Income](../i/income.md) (NECI)**: This includes all other U.S.-source [income](../i/income.md) like [interest](../i/interest.md), dividends, rents, and royalties. NECI is generally subject to a flat 30% [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md), unless a [tax treaty](../t/tax_treaty.md) specifies a lower rate.

## Types of Income

IRS Publication 519 goes into detail about different types of [income](../i/income.md) and their tax treatments. These include:

1. **Wages, Salaries, and Tips**: [Income](../i/income.md) earned from employment in the U.S.
2. **Dividends and [Interest](../i/interest.md)**: [Income](../i/income.md) from investments, both from U.S. and foreign sources.
3. **Rental [Income](../i/income.md)**: [Income](../i/income.md) from renting out property located in the U.S.
4. **[Capital](../c/capital.md) Gains**: Profits from the [sale](../s/sale.md) of property or investments.
5. **Pensions and Annuities**: Retirement [income](../i/income.md).
6. **Scholarships and Fellowships**: Special rules apply to educational grants.

## Deductions and Credits

The publication provides [guidance](../g/guidance.md) on various deductions and credits available to aliens, which can lower [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md) and [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md).

1. **[Standard Deduction](../s/standard_deduction.md)**: Generally only available to resident aliens.
2. **Itemized Deductions**: Including medical expenses, [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [interest](../i/interest.md), and charitable contributions.
3. **Tax Credits**: Such as the [Earned Income](../e/earned_income.md) [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md) (EITC), [Child Tax Credit](../c/child_tax_credit.md) (CTC), and education credits. Availability of these credits can vary based on alien status and individual circumstances.

## Tax Withholding and Payments

### Resident Aliens

Resident aliens have tax [withholding](../w/withholding.md) on their wages similar to U.S. citizens. They may also have to make estimated tax payments if they expect to owe tax of $1,000 or more when the [return](../r/return.md) is filed.

### Nonresident Aliens

Nonresident aliens must have tax withheld on certain types of U.S.-source [income](../i/income.md). They may also need to make estimated tax payments in many instances.

## Filing Status and Requirements

### Resident Aliens

- File Form 1040, 1040A, or 1040EZ.

### Nonresident Aliens

- File Form 1040NR or 1040NR-EZ.

### Dual-Status

- Special rules apply, and specific forms must be filed to accurately reflect resident and nonresident [income](../i/income.md).

## Social Security and Medicare Taxes

### Resident Aliens

- Subject to [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) and Medicare [taxes](../t/taxes.md) on wages.

### Nonresident Aliens

- May be exempt depending on visa type and any applicable tax treaties.

## Foreign Tax Credit

Resident aliens may be eligible to claim a [foreign tax credit](../f/foreign_tax_credit.md) for [taxes](../t/taxes.md) paid to a foreign government on foreign-sourced [income](../i/income.md), helping to mitigate [double taxation](../d/double_taxation.md).

## Other Considerations

### Reporting Foreign Accounts

- FBAR (FinCEN Form 114): Required for individuals with foreign financial accounts exceeding $10,000.
- FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act): Additional reporting requirements under Form 8938.

### Tax Identification Numbers

- **SSN ([Social Security](../s/social_security.md) Number)**: Required for individuals eligible to work in the U.S.
- **ITIN (Individual [Taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) Identification Number)**: Used by nonresident and resident aliens who are not eligible for SSNs.

## Conclusion

IRS Publication 519 is an essential resource for aliens navigating the complexities of the U.S. tax system. By understanding the distinctions between resident and nonresident status, the types of [income](../i/income.md) subject to U.S. [taxation](../t/taxation.md), and the applicable deductions, credits, and treaties, aliens can ensure compliance with U.S. tax laws and optimize their tax situation.

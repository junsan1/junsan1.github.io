# IRS Publication 527

**IRS Publication 527** serves as a comprehensive guideline provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of the United States for individuals who own and rent residential properties. This publication is particularly important for landlords and property owners as it elaborates on the tax implications associated with rental income, allowable deductions, record-keeping requirements, and various aspects related to rental property transactions. Below, we delve into the key components and details outlined in Publication 527.

## Rental Income

### Definition and Examples

Rental income is defined as any payment received for the use or occupation of property. This encompasses various forms of payment including:

- **Regular Rent Payments:** Monthly or annual payments received from tenants.
- **Advance Rent Payments:** Any rent payment received before the period it covers, considered income in the year received.
- **Security Deposits:** Generally not included in income if intended to be returned to the tenant. However, if kept for violations of a lease agreement, it becomes income.
- **Property or Services:** Any non-cash compensation received in lieu of normal rental payments.

### Special Cases

- **Lease with Option to Buy:** Payments received under an arrangement where the tenant may eventually purchase the property.
- **Part Interest in Rental Property:** In cases where only a part of a property is rented, income should be proportional to the part rented.

## Rental Expenses

### Deductible Expenses

Landlords can deduct ordinary and necessary expenses required to successfully manage, conserve, and maintain the rental property. Common deductible expenses include:

- **Advertising:** Costs for promoting available rental properties.
- **Maintenance and Repairs:** Routine maintenance efforts and repairs necessary to keep the property in good condition.
- **Utilities:** Costs of services such as electricity, water, and gas if paid for by the landlord.
- **Insurance Premiums:** Insurance for rental property protection.
- **Mortgage Interest:** Interest payments on loans used to purchase rental property.
- **Property tax:** Taxes assessed on the property and paid by the landlord.
- **Depreciation:** Allows landlords to recover the cost of income-producing property through yearly deductions.

### Non-Deductible Expenses

Some expenses are not deductible. These include:

- Improvements: Costs that add value or substantially prolong the property's useful life (added to property basis for depreciation purposes).
- Personal expenses: Expenses related to the personal use of the property when it's not rented out.

## Depreciation

Depreciation represents the wear and tear or obsolescence of a rental property over time. Landlords can deduct a portion of the propertyâ€™s basis each year, reflecting this decline in value. 

### Depreciable Basis

The initial basis of the property includes the price paid for the property plus certain costs like legal fees and transfer taxes. Improvements that add value or extend the life of the property can be added to the basis for depreciation.

### Depreciation Methods

- **Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS):** The most common method, using specific rules depending on the property type and the date it was placed in service.
- **Straight-Line Depreciation:** Certain properties may also use the straightforward approach of equal yearly deductions.

## Recordkeeping

Maintaining accurate and comprehensive records is essential for managing rental property tax returns:

- **Income Records:** Documentation of all received payments, security deposits, and advance rents.
- **Expense Records:** Receipts, invoices, and proof for all deductible expenses.
- **Depreciation Schedules:** Records of property basis, depreciation methods, deduction amounts, and useful life details.

## Special Situations

### Property Changed to Rental Use

When personal-use property is converted to rental use, its basis for depreciation is the lesser of the property's adjusted basis or the fair market value at the time of conversion.

### Rental Real Estate Activities and Passive Activity Limits

Most rental activities are considered passive activities and are generally subject to passive activity loss limitations. Exceptions may apply if the taxpayer meets certain qualifications, such as being a real estate professional.

### Vacation Homes

Particular rules apply to properties used personally and rented out for part of the year. Deductions may need to be prorated based on the proportion of rental use versus personal use.

## Compliance and Reporting

### Reporting Rental Income

Landlords report rental income on Schedule E (Form 1040), and assess allowable deductions. This ensures all rental-related financial activities are properly documented and reported for tax purposes.

### Filing Deadlines and Extensions

Rental income must be reported annually with personal tax returns, typically due on April 15th. Extensions can be requested if more time is needed.

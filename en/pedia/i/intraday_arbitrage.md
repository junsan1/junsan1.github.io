# Intraday Arbitrage

Intraday [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) is a trading strategy that seeks to take advantage of temporary price discrepancies between identical or similar financial instruments within the same trading day. This trading strategy is based on the principle of "efficient markets," which posits that similar assets should have equivalent prices at any instant. When this condition is not met, opportunities for [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) arise.

### Types of Intraday Arbitrage

1. **Intra-Market [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**: This involves exploiting price differences between identical or similar financial instruments within a single market or exchange. For example, a trader might find a discrepancy between the prices of a stock and its corresponding options.

2. **Inter-Market [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**: Involves taking advantage of price differences between identical or similar financial instruments across different markets or exchanges. For instance, a stock may trade at different prices on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the London Stock Exchange (LSE).

3. **Triangular [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**: This is a strategy typically used in the foreign exchange (Forex) market. It involves converting one currency to another, then to another, and finally back to the original currency in a manner that locks in a risk-free profit due to price discrepancies.

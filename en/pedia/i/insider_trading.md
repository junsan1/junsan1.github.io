# Insider Trading

Insider trading refers to the act of buying or selling a publicly traded company's stock by someone who has non-public, material information about that stock. Insider trading can be either illegal or legal depending on when the insider makes the [trade](../t/trade.md). It is considered illegal when the material information is still non-public, and this form of insider trading carries severe penalties, including both civil and criminal sanctions.

## Definition and Legal Background

### Material Non-Public Information (MNPI)
Material non-public information is information that could affect a company's stock price and has not yet been made available to the general public. Examples include [earnings](../e/earnings.md) reports, news of a pending [merger](../m/merger.md) or [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md), or any significant corporate event. Trading based on this information before it is released to the public is considered illegal.

### Legal Trading
Legal insider trading occurs when corporate insiders—executives, directors, and employees—buy or sell stock in their own companies but report their trades to the relevant financial authorities. These trades must be reported within a prescribed time frame to maintain [transparency](../t/transparency.md) for the general public and other investors.

### Regulations and Enforcement
Several bodies regulate insider trading to ensure [market](../m/market.md) fairness, including the United States Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC). The SEC enforces strict rules to prevent illegal insider trading and protect investors from unfair [market](../m/market.md) disadvantages. Other global regulatory bodies include the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).

## History of Insider Trading

The concept of insider trading dates back to the early 20th century, but it wasn't until the [Securities Exchange Act of 1934](../s/securities_exchange_act_of_1934.md) in the United States that formal regulation was introduced. The act provided the SEC with the power to investigate and discipline individuals involved in insider trading.

### Landmark Cases
One famous case is that of Ivan Boesky, a [Wall Street](../w/wall_street.md) stock [trader](../t/trader.md) who was implicated in the 1986 insider trading scandal. Another notable case is that of Martha Stewart, who was convicted in 2004 for insider trading related to her [sale](../s/sale.md) of [shares](../s/shares.md) in ImClone Systems.

## Risks and Consequences

### Legal Risks
Insider trading carries significant legal risks, including fines, disgorgement ([repayment](../r/repayment.md) of ill-gotten gains), and imprisonment. For example, individuals convicted of insider trading can face up to 20 years in prison in the United States.

### Reputational Risks
Beyond legal consequences, individuals and companies involved in insider trading can face severe reputational damage. This loss of [trust](../t/trust.md) can result in declining stock prices, loss of [business](../b/business.md) relationships, and significant financial loss.

### Market Impact
Insider trading can distort [market efficiency](../m/market_efficiency.md) and fairness, leading to a lack of confidence among retail investors. This erodes the integrity of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and can result in reduced participation, ultimately affecting [market](../m/market.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and stability.

## Detection and Prevention

### Monitoring and Surveillance
Financial regulators and exchanges employ sophisticated monitoring systems to detect [unusual trading patterns](../u/unusual_trading_patterns.md) that may indicate insider trading. These systems analyze vast amounts of trading data for anomalies that could signify the use of non-public information.

### Whistleblowing Programs
Many jurisdictions have implemented whistleblowing programs that provide incentives for individuals to report insider trading activities. The SEC’s [Whistleblower](../w/whistleblower.md) Program, for example, offers monetary rewards for information leading to successful enforcement actions.

### Compliance Programs
Corporations often have [robust](../r/robust.md) compliance programs to prevent insider trading. These programs include training for employees, regular audits, and policies on information sharing within the company.

## Ethical Considerations

### Fiduciary Responsibilities
Corporate insiders have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of their shareholders. Trading based on non-public information can be seen as a breach of this duty, as it puts insiders' interests above those of the general public.

### Market Integrity
Maintaining the integrity of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) is crucial for ensuring [investor](../i/investor.md) confidence. Ethical behavior by corporate insiders helps sustain [trust](../t/trust.md) in the fairness and functioning of these markets.

## Famous Cases and Their Impact

### Ivan Boesky
Ivan Boesky was a prominent figure in one of the largest insider trading scandals of the 1980s. His activities led to a significant crackdown on insider trading, resulting in stricter regulations and heightened awareness of the [issue](../i/issue.md).

### Martha Stewart
The case of Martha Stewart, who was convicted in 2004 for her involvement in an insider trading scandal related to ImClone Systems, drew extensive media attention. Her conviction underscored the legal and reputational consequences of insider trading, even for well-known public figures.

## Conclusion

Insider trading remains a significant concern in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), attracting scrutiny from regulators, corporations, and investors. While legal insider trading is a legitimate activity that promotes [transparency](../t/transparency.md), illegal insider trading undermines [market](../m/market.md) integrity and fairness. Continuous efforts by regulatory bodies, [robust](../r/robust.md) compliance programs, and ethical behavior by corporate insiders are essential to combating this [issue](../i/issue.md) and maintaining the [trust](../t/trust.md) and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

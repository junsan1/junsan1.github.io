# Inverse ETF

An inverse [exchange](../e/exchange.md)-traded [fund](../f/fund.md) (ETF), also referred to as a "short ETF" or "bear ETF," is a type of ETF that aims to deliver the opposite [return](../r/return.md) of a particular [index](../i/index.md) or [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for a single day. This [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) is popular among traders and investors who seek to [profit](../p/profit.md) from declining markets or to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) other positions in their portfolios. Unlike traditional ETFs that are designed to track and replicate the performance of an [index](../i/index.md) like the S&P 500, an inverse ETF aims to move in the opposite direction. Therefore, if the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [index](../i/index.md) decreases in [value](../v/value.md), the inverse ETF should increase in [value](../v/value.md), and vice versa.

## Mechanism of Inverse ETFs

[Inverse ETFs](../i/inverse_etfs.md) achieve their objective by using a variety of [financial derivatives](../f/financial_derivatives.md), including [options](../o/options.md), [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md), and short sales. These complex financial instruments enable the inverse ETF to mimic the opposite performance of the target [index](../i/index.md) on a daily [basis](../b/basis.md). Here’s a closer look at these mechanisms:

### Short Selling

[Short selling](../s/short_selling.md) involves borrowing [shares](../s/shares.md) of a [security](../s/security.md) and selling them on the [open market](../o/open_market.md) with the intention of buying them back later at a lower price. [Inverse ETFs](../i/inverse_etfs.md) employ [short selling](../s/short_selling.md) as one of the strategies to achieve their inverse performance. If the price of the target [index](../i/index.md) drops, the short-sold [shares](../s/shares.md) can be bought back at a lower price, resulting in a [profit](../p/profit.md) that contributes to the increase in the ETF's [value](../v/value.md).

### Use of Derivatives

[Derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) such as [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md), [options](../o/options.md), and swaps are frequently employed to amplify the effects of the inverse exposure. [Futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md), for example, are agreements to buy or sell an [asset](../a/asset.md) at a future date for a predetermined price. By entering into short [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md), an inverse ETF can [gain](../g/gain.md) from a decline in the price of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [index](../i/index.md).

### Leverage

Some [inverse ETFs](../i/inverse_etfs.md) are leveraged, meaning they seek to deliver a [multiple](../m/multiple.md) (e.g., -2x or -3x) of the daily inverse [return](../r/return.md) of the target [index](../i/index.md). Leveraged [inverse ETFs](../i/inverse_etfs.md) use a combination of [debt](../d/debt.md) and [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) to achieve these amplified returns, which magnifies both gains and losses.

## Benefits of Inverse ETFs

[Inverse ETFs](../i/inverse_etfs.md) provide several advantages for investors seeking to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) their portfolios or [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on [market](../m/market.md) downturns:

### Portfolio Hedging

[Inverse ETFs](../i/inverse_etfs.md) are commonly used as a hedging tool. Investors holding long positions in equities can buy [inverse ETFs](../i/inverse_etfs.md) to protect against potential losses during [market](../m/market.md) downturns. If the [equity market](../e/equity_market.md) declines, the gains from the inverse ETF can [offset](../o/offset.md) some or all of the losses in the portfolio.

### Tactical Asset Allocation

Traders often use [inverse ETFs](../i/inverse_etfs.md) for short-term tactical adjustments in their [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md), especially during periods of high [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) or bearish sentiment. Since [inverse ETFs](../i/inverse_etfs.md) can be bought and sold like traditional [stocks](../s/stock.md), they [offer](../o/offer.md) a convenient way to [gain](../g/gain.md) exposure to short [market](../m/market.md) positions without the complexities of individual [short selling](../s/short_selling.md).

### Liquidity

[Inverse ETFs](../i/inverse_etfs.md) are [listed](../l/listed.md) on major stock exchanges, providing high [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md). Investors can easily buy and sell [shares](../s/shares.md) throughout the trading day at [market](../m/market.md) prices, unlike mutual funds that are typically priced at the end of the trading day.

## Risks Associated with Inverse ETFs

While [inverse ETFs](../i/inverse_etfs.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) opportunities for [profit](../p/profit.md) in declining markets, they also come with significant risks:

### Daily Rebalancing and Compounding

[Inverse ETFs](../i/inverse_etfs.md) are designed to provide their inverse [return](../r/return.md) on a daily [basis](../b/basis.md). Because of this daily objective, the performance of an inverse ETF can deviate significantly from the inverse performance of the target [index](../i/index.md) over longer periods. This is due to the effects of daily [compounding](../c/compounding.md), especially in volatile markets. As such, [inverse ETFs](../i/inverse_etfs.md) are generally not recommended for long-term holding.

### Leverage Risk

Leveraged [inverse ETFs](../i/inverse_etfs.md) amplify the risks associated with both [leverage](../l/leverage.md) and [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md). While these funds can provide higher returns in a declining [market](../m/market.md), they can also lead to substantial losses if the [market](../m/market.md) moves against the [investor](../i/investor.md)’s position.

### Market Risks

[Inverse ETFs](../i/inverse_etfs.md) are subject to the same [market](../m/market.md) risks as other investment products. Factors such as geopolitical events, economic data, and [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) can impact the performance of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [index](../i/index.md) and thus the inverse ETF.

### Derivative Risks

The use of [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) such as [options](../o/options.md) and [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) adds an additional layer of [risk](../r/risk.md). These contracts are often more volatile than the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) securities and carry risks of their own, including [counterparty risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md) and [liquidity risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md).

## Tax Considerations

Investors should be aware of the tax implications of trading [inverse ETFs](../i/inverse_etfs.md). Because these funds often engage in [short-term trading](../s/short-term_trading.md) and use complex [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), they may generate significant short-term [capital](../c/capital.md) gains, which are taxed at a higher rate than long-term [capital](../c/capital.md) gains. Additionally, frequent trading within these funds can lead to high [turnover](../t/turnover.md) rates and subsequent tax liabilities.

## Prominent Inverse ETFs

There are numerous [inverse ETFs](../i/inverse_etfs.md) available in the [market](../m/market.md), each targeting different indices and sectors. Here are a few prominent examples:

### ProShares Short S&P 500 (SH)

ProShares Short S&P 500 seeks to provide -1x the daily performance of the S&P 500. This ETF is one of the most popular [inverse ETFs](../i/inverse_etfs.md) and is often used by investors looking to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against declines in the broader U.S. [stock market](../s/stock_market.md).

## Conclusion

[Inverse ETFs](../i/inverse_etfs.md) are powerful financial instruments that [offer](../o/offer.md) investors and traders the ability to [profit](../p/profit.md) from declining markets or to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) their portfolios against downturns. By employing strategies such as [short selling](../s/short_selling.md) and the use of [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), these ETFs can deliver inverse returns that are useful in various tactical and [hedging strategies](../h/hedging_strategies.md). However, they also come with a set of unique risks, particularly due to daily [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md), [leverage](../l/leverage.md), and the complexities involved in [derivative](../d/derivative.md) instruments. Investors considering [inverse ETFs](../i/inverse_etfs.md) should conduct thorough research and possibly consult financial advisors to assess whether these tools align with their investment objectives and [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md).

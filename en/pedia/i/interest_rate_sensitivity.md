# Interest Rate Sensitivity

[Interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) sensitivity refers to a [security](../s/security.md)'s [volatility](../v/volatility.md) relative to movements in prevailing [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. This concept is particularly significant in the [bond market](../b/bond_market.md), where the prices of securities are inversely related to [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. When [interest](../i/interest.md) rates rise, [bond](../b/bond.md) prices typically fall, and vice versa. Understanding [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) sensitivity can help investors make strategic decisions to mitigate risks and optimize returns. This document delves into the technical aspects of [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) sensitivity, its measurement, and its effects on various financial instruments.

## Concepts in Interest Rate Sensitivity

### Duration and Convexity
Key terms in [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) sensitivity include [duration](../d/duration.md) and [convexity](../c/convexity.md), both of which measure [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md).

#### Duration
[Duration](../d/duration.md) is a measure of the sensitivity of the price of a [bond](../b/bond.md) to a change in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, typically expressed in years. It estimates the [percentage change](../p/percentage_change.md) in the price of a [bond](../b/bond.md) for a 1% change in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

- **[Macaulay Duration](../m/macaulay_duration.md)**: The [weighted average](../w/weighted_average.md) time to receive the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s cash flows.
- **[Modified Duration](../m/modified_duration.md)**: This adjusts the [Macaulay Duration](../m/macaulay_duration.md) for changes in [yield](../y/yield.md), providing a more accurate measure of a [bond](../b/bond.md)'s [price sensitivity](../p/price_sensitivity.md) to rate changes.

#### Convexity
[Convexity](../c/convexity.md) further refines the approximation provided by [duration](../d/duration.md). It describes how the [duration](../d/duration.md) of a [bond](../b/bond.md) changes as the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) changes, representing the curvature in the relationship between [bond](../b/bond.md) prices and yields. Bonds with higher [convexity](../c/convexity.md) are less affected by [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) fluctuations, [offering](../o/offering.md) an additional layer of [risk](../r/risk.md) assessment.

## Mathematical Models

### Yield to Maturity (YTM)
[Yield to Maturity](../y/yield_to_maturity.md) is the [total return](../t/total_return.md) anticipated on a [bond](../b/bond.md) if held until it matures. YTM is considered a long-term [bond yield](../b/bond_yield.md) expressed as an annual rate. It is the internal [rate of return](../r/rate_of_return.md) (IRR) of the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s cash flows.

### Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)
DCF analysis is used to estimate the attractiveness of an investment opportunity by [discounting](../d/discounting.md) future cash flows to [present value](../p/present_value.md) using the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md).

## Interest Rate Sensitivity in Different Securities

### Fixed-Rate Bonds
Fixed-rate bonds are susceptible to [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) fluctuations. Their prices decrease when [interest](../i/interest.md) rates rise because the fixed [interest](../i/interest.md) payments from these bonds become less attractive compared to new bonds issued at higher rates.

### Floating-Rate Bonds
Floating-rate bonds, or floaters, [offer](../o/offer.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) payments that revise periodically based on a [reference rate](../r/reference_rate.md). These bonds typically exhibit lower [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) sensitivity since their payments adjust in response to [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) changes.

### Equities
While equities are not as directly influenced by [interest](../i/interest.md) rates as bonds, they can still exhibit sensitivity. For example, high-[dividend](../d/dividend.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) might lose appeal when rates rise as investors shift to newly issued bonds with better returns.

## Measuring Interest Rate Sensitivity

### Beta
In equities, a stock's [beta](../b/beta.md) measures its sensitivity to the [market](../m/market.md), but in [fixed income](../f/fixed_income.md), the [beta](../b/beta.md) of a [bond](../b/bond.md) or [bond](../b/bond.md) portfolio against a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [index](../i/index.md) can elucidate its [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) sensitivity.

### Key Rate Duration (KRD)
KRD measures the sensitivity of bonds to [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) changes at specific [maturity](../m/maturity.md) points on the [yield curve](../y/yield_curve.md), allowing for pinpointing certain segments of the curve that might impact the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s price the most.

## Practical Applications

### Portfolio Management
Portfolio managers use [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) sensitivity to balance expected returns against [risk](../r/risk.md) exposure. Diversified portfolios might blend [duration](../d/duration.md)- and [convexity](../c/convexity.md)-focused strategies to optimize performance under varying [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) environments.

### Hedging
Investors can [hedge](../h/hedge.md) [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md) through [derivative](../d/derivative.md) instruments such as [interest rate swaps](../i/interest_rate_swaps.md) or [options](../o/options.md). By locking in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, investors mitigate the [risk](../r/risk.md) of adverse rate movements.

### Algorithmic Trading
In [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), predefined rules and models adjust [bond](../b/bond.md) portfolios in response to [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) shifts. These models may use historical data to predict changes and set [trading signals](../t/trading_signals.md).

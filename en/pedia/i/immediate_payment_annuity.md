# Immediate Payment Annuity

An Immediate [Payment](../p/payment.md) Annuity, often referred to as a Single [Premium](../p/premium.md) Immediate Annuity (SPIA), is a financial product designed to provide a stream of [income](../i/income.md) payments to the [annuitant](../a/annuitant.md), commencing almost immediately after a lump sum of [money](../m/money.md) is paid to an [insurance](../i/insurance.md) company. This type of annuity is popular among retirees looking for a reliable source of [income](../i/income.md) to cover their living expenses in retirement. Here's a detailed exploration of the Immediate [Payment](../p/payment.md) Annuity, including its features, benefits, drawbacks, and companies that [offer](../o/offer.md) these products.

## Key Features of Immediate Payment Annuities

### 1. Lump-Sum Payment
The [annuitant](../a/annuitant.md) makes a single, [lump-sum payment](../l/lump-sum_payment.md) to the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) company. This sum is usually derived from retirement savings or other sources of accumulated [wealth](../w/wealth.md).

### 2. Immediate Income Stream
Unlike deferred annuities, which begin payouts at a future date, Immediate [Payment](../p/payment.md) Annuities start paying [income](../i/income.md) typically within one month, but no longer than 12 months after the initial [premium](../p/premium.md) is paid.

### 3. Fixed or Variable Payments
The [income](../i/income.md) payments can be fixed, meaning they remain the same throughout the [annuitant](../a/annuitant.md)’s life, or variable, adjusting based on investment performance or other factors.

### 4. Lifetime or Fixed Period
Payments can be structured to last for the lifetime of the [annuitant](../a/annuitant.md), for a specified number of years, or for a combination of these [options](../o/options.md) (e.g., lifetime with a guaranteed term).

### 5. Payout Options
There are several [payout](../p/payout.md) [options](../o/options.md) available, including:
- **Life Only:** Payments cease upon the death of the [annuitant](../a/annuitant.md).
- **Life with Period Certain:** Guarantees payments for a specified period, even if the [annuitant](../a/annuitant.md) dies.
- **[Joint](../j/joint.md) and Survivor:** Provides payments for the lifetimes of two individuals, usually a couple.

## Benefits of Immediate Payment Annuities

### 1. Income Certainty
Immediate [Payment](../p/payment.md) Annuities provide a predictable and stable [income](../i/income.md) stream, making [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md) in retirement simpler.

### 2. Longevity Risk Mitigation
By providing [income](../i/income.md) for life, Immediate [Payment](../p/payment.md) Annuities help mitigate the [risk](../r/risk.md) of outliving one's savings, often referred to as longevity [risk](../r/risk.md).

### 3. Simplified Financial Management
For retirees, the regular [income](../i/income.md) provided by an Immediate [Payment](../p/payment.md) Annuity reduces the need to manage investments actively.

### 4. Potential Tax Benefits
In many jurisdictions, a portion of each [payment](../p/payment.md) is considered a [return](../r/return.md) of [principal](../p/principal.md) and is not subject to [income tax](../i/income_tax.md), especially beneficial for [tax planning](../t/tax_planning.md).

## Drawbacks of Immediate Payment Annuities

### 1. Lack of Liquidity
Once the lump sum is paid, it generally cannot be accessed for other needs, which can be a major drawback if unexpected expenses arise.

### 2. Inflation Risk
If the annuity does not include an [inflation](../i/inflation.md) adjustment feature, the [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) of the [fixed income](../f/fixed_income.md) stream may decline over time due to [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

### 3. Opportunity Cost
The lump sum used to purchase an annuity is no longer available for investment elsewhere, potentially leading to missed opportunities for higher returns.

### 4. Death Before Breakeven
If the [annuitant](../a/annuitant.md) dies shortly after payments begin and did not select a period certain or survivor benefit, the total payments received may be less than the initial [premium](../p/premium.md) paid.

## Considerations Before Purchasing

### 1. Financial Stability of the Issuer
It's crucial to assess the financial strength and [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) of the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) company issuing the annuity, as the promise of [income](../i/income.md) depends on the company’s ability to fulfill its [obligations](../o/obligation.md).

### 2. Fee Structure
Understanding the [fee](../f/fee.md) structure, including administrative fees and commissions, is essential as these can impact the total [income](../i/income.md) received.

### 3. Inflation Protection
Opt for annuities that [offer](../o/offer.md) [inflation](../i/inflation.md)-adjusted payments if concerned about maintaining [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) over time.

### 4. Surrender Charges
Some annuities may include surrender charges or penalties for early [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md), which need to be clearly understood.

# Interbank Rate

## Introduction
Interbank rates play a vital role in the global [financial system](../f/financial_system.md); they represent the rates of [interest](../i/interest.md) charged on short-term loans between banks. These rates are pivotal for managing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) within the banking sector and have wider implications for various financial instruments and [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md).

## Key Concepts

### Definition
The interbank rate, also known as the interbank lending rate, is the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) at which banks lend to each other, typically on an overnight [basis](../b/basis.md). These rates are not directly accessible to individual consumers but significantly influence borrowing and savings rates in the broader [economy](../e/economy.md).

### Importance
The interbank rate is crucial for several reasons:
- It helps maintain [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) in the banking system.
- It serves as a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for other [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, including those for mortgages, savings accounts, and loans.
- It reflects the health of the banking sector and overall [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md).
- It influences [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) and central banks' decisions regarding [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

## Types of Interbank Rates

### LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate)
LIBOR historically was one of the most used globally and served as a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for an array of financial instruments. It represented the rates at which major global banks borrowed from one another. However, due to various scandals and manipulations, LIBOR is being phased out and replaced.

### SONIA (Sterling Overnight Index Average)
SONIA is an [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for sterling-denominated [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) and other financial contracts. It measures the average of overnight [interest](../i/interest.md) rates paid by banks in the sterling [market](../m/market.md).

### EONIA (Euro Overnight Index Average)
EONIA represents the overnight [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) for the [eurozone](../e/eurozone.md). It's calculated as a [weighted average](../w/weighted_average.md) of all overnight unsecured lending transactions in the [interbank market](../i/interbank_market.md) by a panel of contributing banks.

### Federal Funds Rate
In the United States, the [Federal Funds Rate](../f/federal_funds_rate.md) is the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) at which [depository](../d/depository.md) institutions [trade](../t/trade.md) [federal funds](../f/federal_funds.md) with each other overnight. It is a key tool of [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) implemented by the Federal Reserve.

### Euribor (Euro Interbank Offered Rate)
Euribor rates are calculated as the average [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) at which a panel of European banks lend to one another. It serves as a [reference rate](../r/reference_rate.md) for various financial products in the [eurozone](../e/eurozone.md).

### TIBOR (Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate)
TIBOR serves as Japan's interbank lending rate [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md). It reflects the [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md) and interbank lending practices in the Japanese [market](../m/market.md).

### Other Notable Rates
- SHIBOR (Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate)
- HIBOR (Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate)
- SIBOR (Singapore Interbank Offered Rate)

## Calculation Methods

### Quoted vs Effective Rates
- Quoted Interbank Rate: The advertised rate between banks, often involving verbal or written agreements.
- Effective Interbank Rate: The actual rate realized in transactions, which can vary from the quoted rate due to various factors like [risk premium](../r/risk_premium.md) and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).

### Contributing Banks
For most interbank rates, a panel of contributor banks provides data based on their lending activities or estimations. This data is then aggregated, eliminating outliers, to compute an average rate.

### Calculation Process
1. Collection of Data: Banks submit their [interest](../i/interest.md) rates daily.
2. Filtering: Outlying rates may be excluded to avoid distortions.
3. Averaging: The remaining rates are averaged to produce the daily rate.

## Historical Evolution
- The concept of interbank rates has evolved with [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). 
- LIBOR began in the 1980s and became the predominant [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md).
- Post-Global [Financial Crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) reforms emphasized creating more transparent and reliable benchmarks, leading to new rates like SONIA and SOFR (Secured Overnight [Financing](../f/financing.md) Rate).

## Regulatory and Compliance Aspects

### Oversight
Different interbank rates are overseen by various regulatory bodies:
- LIBOR was overseen by the ICE [Benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) Administration.
- Euribor is regulated by the European [Money](../m/money.md) Markets Institute (EMMI).
- [Federal Funds Rate](../f/federal_funds_rate.md) is administered by the Federal Reserve.

### Scandals and Reforms
The LIBOR manipulation scandal highlighted vulnerabilities and led to major reforms, emphasizing the need for reliable and transparent benchmarks. These reforms include:
- Enhanced oversight and governance.
- Transitioning to new benchmarks like SOFR.
- Reducing reliance on theoretical estimates in favor of [transaction](../t/transaction.md)-based data.

## Applications in Financial Markets

### Loans and Mortgages
- Many adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) and personal loans are directly tied to interbank rates.
- Changes in interbank rates quickly influence the rates consumers pay on their loans.

### Derivatives
- [Derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) like [interest rate swaps](../i/interest_rate_swaps.md), [futures](../f/futures.md), and [options](../o/options.md) often rely on interbank rates as benchmarks.
- Accurate benchmarks are crucial for pricing these financial instruments.

### Bonds and Fixed-Income Securities
- Corporate bonds and government securities often use interbank rates for setting coupon rates.
- A rise or fall in interbank rates can affect [bond](../b/bond.md) yields and prices.

## Impact on Monetary Policy
Central banks monitor interbank rates as part of their [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) toolkit. Adjustments to policy rates, such as the [Federal Funds Rate](../f/federal_funds_rate.md) or the European Central [Bank](../b/bank.md)'s main refinancing operations rate, directly influence interbank rates, which in turn affect the broader [economy](../e/economy.md).

### Transmission Mechanism
1. **Policy Rate Change**: Central [bank](../b/bank.md) alters the policy rate.
2. **Interbank Rate Adjustments**: Banks adjust their interbank lending rates accordingly.
3. **Impact on Banking Sector**: Changes flow through to [loan](../l/loan.md) and [deposit](../d/deposit.md) rates.
4. **Economic Influence**: The broader [economy](../e/economy.md) feels the effects through changes in [credit](../c/credit.md) availability and cost of borrowing.

## Case Studies and Examples

### Global Financial Crisis (2008-2009)
- During the crisis, interbank lending froze, and rates spiked.
- Central banks had to intervene massively with [liquidity provision](../l/liquidity_provision.md) and rate cuts.

### LIBOR Scandal
- Major banks were found to have manipulated LIBOR submissions to [profit](../p/profit.md) from trades.
- Resulted in billions in fines and a significant overhaul of the interbank rate setting process.

### Covid-19 Pandemic
- Central banks acted quickly to keep interbank rates low to support economies.
- Both traditional rate cuts and unconventional measures, like [asset](../a/asset.md) purchase programs, were used.

## Conclusions
Interbank rates are essential for the functioning of the global [financial system](../f/financial_system.md). They serve as benchmarks for various financial products, influence [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md), and are indicators of economic health. Understanding the dynamics of interbank rates is crucial for financial professionals, regulators, and policymakers.

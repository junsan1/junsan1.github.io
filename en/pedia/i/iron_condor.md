# Iron Condor

An Iron Condor is an advanced [options](../o/options.md) strategy used by traders to limit [risk](../r/risk.md) and generate steady [income](../i/income.md). This strategy involves simultaneously holding both a call spread and a put spread, with all [options](../o/options.md) having the same [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md) but different strike prices. The goal of this strategy is to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on low [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and make a [profit](../p/profit.md) from the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) trading within a specific [range](../r/range.md).

## Components of an Iron Condor

An Iron Condor consists of four [options](../o/options.md):

1. **Sell a [call option](../c/call_option.md) at a higher [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) (C1)**
2. **Buy a [call option](../c/call_option.md) at an even higher [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) (C2)**
3. **Sell a [put option](../p/put.md) at a lower [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) (P1)**
4. **Buy a [put option](../p/put.md) at an even lower [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) (P2)**

The structure generally looks like this:

- Buy Put (P2) - Lower Strike
- Sell Put (P1) - Lower Middle Strike
- Sell Call (C1) - Upper Middle Strike
- Buy Call (C2) - Upper Strike

## Example

To illustrate, let's assume an [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock is trading at $100. An Iron Condor might look like this:

- Buy 1 Put with [Strike Price](../s/strike_price.md) $95 (P2)
- Sell 1 Put with [Strike Price](../s/strike_price.md) $100 (P1)
- Sell 1 Call with [Strike Price](../s/strike_price.md) $105 (C1)
- Buy 1 Call with [Strike Price](../s/strike_price.md) $110 (C2)

This creates a zone of profitability between the $100 and $105 strike prices.

## Risk and Reward

### Maximum Profit

The maximum [profit](../p/profit.md) occurs when the stock price is between the middle strike prices at expiration ($100 - $105 in our example). The [profit](../p/profit.md) can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Max Profit} = \text{[Net Premium](../n/net_premium.md) Received} \]

### Maximum Loss

The maximum loss occurs when the stock price is outside the bought option strikes ($95 or $110 in our example). The loss can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Max Loss} = \text{Widest Spread} - \text{[Net Premium](../n/net_premium.md) Received} \]

### Breakeven Points

An Iron Condor has two breakeven points:

1. Upper breakeven: \$105 ([short call](../s/short_call.md) strike) + [net premium](../n/net_premium.md)
2. Lower breakeven: \$100 ([short put](../s/short_put.md) strike) - [net premium](../n/net_premium.md)

## Advantages of Iron Condor

1. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: The strategy caps both the potential [profit](../p/profit.md) and potential loss, helping traders to manage [risk](../r/risk.md) effectively.
2. **Steady [Income](../i/income.md)**: It's designed to generate consistent [income](../i/income.md) in a low-[volatility](../v/volatility.md) environment.
3. **Flexibility**: Suitable for various [market](../m/market.md) conditions and can be adjusted for higher or lower [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md).

## Disadvantages of Iron Condor

1. **Limited [Profit](../p/profit.md) Potential**: The strategy's capped potential [profit](../p/profit.md) may not be attractive to all investors.
2. **Complexity**: Requires a good understanding of [options](../o/options.md) trading and effective management of [multiple](../m/multiple.md) positions.
3. **[Volatility Risk](../v/volatility_risk.md)**: High [volatility](../v/volatility.md) can lead to losses if the stock price moves outside the profitable [range](../r/range.md).

## Ideal Market Conditions

The Iron Condor thrives in low-[volatility](../v/volatility.md) environments where the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) is expected to [trade](../t/trade.md) within a narrow [range](../r/range.md). [Market](../m/market.md) conditions favorable for this strategy include:

1. **Low [Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: Implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md) should be low for optimal entry point.
2. **Stable [Market](../m/market.md)**: The [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) should not experience abrupt price changes.

## Adjustments and Exit Strategies

### Adjustments

If the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) price threatens to breach the profitable [range](../r/range.md), traders can:

1. **Close the Entire Position**: Limit losses by closing all four [options](../o/options.md).
2. **Roll the [Spreads](../s/spreads.md)**: Adjust strike prices by rolling the [options](../o/options.md) further out in time.
3. **Add Additional Positions**: Counteract adverse movements by adding complementary positions.

### Exit Strategies

1. **[Hold](../h/hold.md) to Expiration**: Allow the [options](../o/options.md) to expire if they're within the profitable [range](../r/range.md).
2. **Close Early**: If the [trade](../t/trade.md) is profitable, exit early for a partial [gain](../g/gain.md).
3. **[Stop-Loss Orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md)**: Predefine exit points to limit losses and manage [trade](../t/trade.md) outcomes.

One should evaluate the Iron Condor against personal [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md), trading goals, and current [market](../m/market.md) conditions. It requires active monitoring and adjustments to stay profitable.

## Conclusion

The Iron Condor strategy provides a balanced approach to [options](../o/options.md) trading by combining two [spreads](../s/spreads.md) that cap both potential gains and losses. While complex, itâ€™s a favored method among traders looking for steady [income](../i/income.md) in low-[volatility](../v/volatility.md) markets. Proper [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) and a thorough understanding of [market](../m/market.md) conditions are essential for successful Iron Condor trading.

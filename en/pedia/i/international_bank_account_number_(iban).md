# International Bank Account Number (IBAN)

The International [Bank](../b/bank.md) [Account Number](../a/account_number.md) (IBAN) is an internationally standardized system for identifying [bank](../b/bank.md) accounts across national borders. Its primary purpose is to make cross-border payments more efficient and safer. The IBAN was initially developed to facilitate payments within the [European Union](../e/european_union_(eu).md), but it has since been adopted by other countries and regions around the world. This document provides a detailed explanation of what an IBAN is, its structure, the global adoption status, benefits, and how it compares to other international [payment](../p/payment.md) identifiers.

## What is an IBAN?

An IBAN is a unique code that identifies a specific [bank](../b/bank.md) account at a specific financial institution in a specific country. It is designed to simplify and speed up international [bank](../b/bank.md) transactions by providing a uniform format that can be easily validated and processed by banks and other financial institutions.

## Structure of an IBAN

An IBAN consists of up to 34 alphanumeric characters, which include the following components:

1. **Country Code**: The first two letters represent the country in which the [bank](../b/bank.md) account is held. This code is based on the ISO 3166-1 [alpha](../a/alpha.md)-2 standard. For example, "GB" for the United Kingdom, "DE" for Germany, or "FR" for France.
   
2. **[Check](../c/check.md) Digits**: The next two digits provide a method for validating the IBAN to prevent errors in transcription. These digits are calculated using the MOD-97-10 algorithm.
   
3. **Basic [Bank](../b/bank.md) [Account Number](../a/account_number.md) (BBAN)**: The remaining characters form the Basic [Bank](../b/bank.md) [Account Number](../a/account_number.md), which varies in length and format from one country to another. The BBAN includes the [bank](../b/bank.md) code, branch code, and the [account number](../a/account_number.md) itself.

### Example of an IBAN

An IBAN for a [bank](../b/bank.md) account in Germany might look like this:
```
DE89 3704 0044 0532 0130 00
```

Here, "DE" stands for Germany, "89" is the [check](../c/check.md) digits, and "3704 0044 0532 0130 00" is the BBAN.

## Global Adoption

The use of IBANs has been mandated by the [European Union](../e/european_union_(eu).md) for all cross-border transactions within the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA). Many other countries around the world have also adopted the system to facilitate international transactions. Some of the regions and countries that have adopted IBAN include:

- [European Union](../e/european_union_(eu).md) (27 member states)
- European [Free Trade](../f/free_trade.md) Association (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland)
- Other countries (Albania, Algeria, Andorra, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Costa Rica, Georgia, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Mauritania, Mauritius, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, Pakistan, Palestine, Qatar, San Marino, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Tunisia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates)

As of the knowledge cutoff date in October 2021, around 70 countries have adopted the IBAN system.

## Benefits of Using IBAN

The use of IBAN provides several benefits for international financial transactions:

1. **[Efficiency](../e/efficiency.md)**: By standardizing the format of [bank](../b/bank.md) account numbers, IBAN reduces the time and effort required to process international transactions.
2. **Error Reduction**: The [check](../c/check.md) digits help prevent errors in data entry, ensuring that funds are transferred to the correct account.
3. **Cost Reduction**: Faster processing times and reduced error rates help lower the costs associated with international payments.
4. **Improved Automation**: The consistent format allows for greater automation of [payment](../p/payment.md) processing systems, further enhancing [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and reducing human intervention.

## How IBAN Compares to Other Payment Identifiers

IBAN is just one of several systems designed to facilitate international payments. Here are some common alternatives:

- **SWIFT/BIC Code**: The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) assigns [Business](../b/business.md) Identifier Codes (BICs) to financial institutions. These codes are used alongside IBANs for international transfers.
  
- **ABA Routing Number**: Used primarily within the United States, the American Bankers Association (ABA) routing number identifies financial institutions but is not standardized for international use.

- **CHIPS UID**: The [Clearing House](../c/clearing_house.md) Interbank Payments System (CHIPS) Universal Identifier (UID) is used in the US for large-[value](../v/value.md) payments, often within the same country.

While IBAN provides a more standardized format across borders, SWIFT/BIC codes and other identifiers are still commonly used in conjunction with IBAN to ensure accurate routing of international payments.

### Example of How IBAN Works

Consider an example of an international [payment](../p/payment.md) from a [bank](../b/bank.md) in France to a [bank](../b/bank.md) in Germany.

1. The sender's [bank](../b/bank.md) in France [will](../w/will.md) request the IBAN of the recipient's account in Germany.
2. The sender's [bank](../b/bank.md) [will](../w/will.md) verify the validity of the IBAN using the [check](../c/check.md) digits.
3. Once verified, the sender's [bank](../b/bank.md) [will](../w/will.md) initiate the transfer using the SWIFT network, including both the IBAN of the recipient and the SWIFT/BIC code of the recipient's [bank](../b/bank.md).
4. The recipient's [bank](../b/bank.md) in Germany [will](../w/will.md) receive the [payment](../p/payment.md) instruction and [credit](../c/credit.md) the specified account based on the IBAN.

This process ensures that the [payment](../p/payment.md) is directed accurately and efficiently to the intended recipient.

## Conclusion

The International [Bank](../b/bank.md) [Account Number](../a/account_number.md) (IBAN) is a crucial component of modern international banking, providing a standardized and reliable method for identifying [bank](../b/bank.md) accounts across national borders. Its adoption has significantly improved the [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md), accuracy, and cost-effectiveness of cross-border financial transactions. As global [commerce](../c/commerce.md) continues to expand, the use of IBAN [will](../w/will.md) likely become even more widespread, further enhancing the ease of international payments.

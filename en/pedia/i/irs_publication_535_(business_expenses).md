# IRS Publication 535

## Introduction
IRS Publication 535, entitled "[Business](../b/business.md) Expenses," is a comprehensive document provided by the Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Service that guides [business](../b/business.md) owners, self-employed individuals, and other taxpayers through the complex landscape of [business](../b/business.md)-related expenditures that can be deducted from [gross income](../g/gross_income.md) to reduce the [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md) of a [business](../b/business.md). The publication is a pivotal resource, covering various types of expenses that can be deductible, the limitations on these deductions, and the necessary record-keeping practices required to substantiate claims.

## Types of Deductible Business Expenses
[Business](../b/business.md) expenses must be both ordinary and necessary to qualify for deductions. An "ordinary" [expense](../e/expense.md) is one that is common and accepted in the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md)'s [trade](../t/trade.md) or [business](../b/business.md). A "necessary" [expense](../e/expense.md) is one that is helpful and appropriate for the [business](../b/business.md). 

### Common Business Expenses
1. **Advertising**: Costs related to advertising and [marketing](../m/marketing.md) are generally deductible. This includes expenditures on print ads, mailings, online advertising, radio spots, and more.
2. **Car and Truck Expenses**: Costs for vehicles used in [business](../b/business.md), such as fuel, repairs, and leasing, can often be deducted. The IRS offers a standard mileage rate method and an actual [expense](../e/expense.md) method for this calculation.

# Intrinsic Value Models

[Intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) models are [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md) tools used in [finance](../f/finance.md) to determine the [value](../v/value.md) of an [asset](../a/asset.md), typically a [security](../s/security.md) like [stocks](../s/stock.md) or bonds. These models aim to estimate the true or "intrinsic" [value](../v/value.md) of the [asset](../a/asset.md), independent of its [market price](../m/market_price.md). The [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) is derived through various forms of fundamental data analysis, including but not limited to [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md), dividends, [earnings](../e/earnings.md) growth, and [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

Understanding the [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) is crucial for investors seeking to identify underpriced or overpriced securities. The disparity between the [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) of a [security](../s/security.md) and its current [market price](../m/market_price.md) generally directs investment decisions. For instance, if the [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) of a stock is higher than its [market price](../m/market_price.md), the stock is considered [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md), presenting a potential buy opportunity. On the contrary, if the [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) is lower than the [market price](../m/market_price.md), the stock is [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md), indicating a possible sell.

### Types of Intrinsic Value Models

#### Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model

One of the most renowned [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) models is the Discounted [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md) (DCF) model. The DCF model calculates the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of a company's estimated future cash flows. The formula involves estimating the future cash flows of the company and [discounting](../d/discounting.md) them back to their [present value](../p/present_value.md) using an appropriate [discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md), usually the company's [weighted average](../w/weighted_average.md) [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md) (WACC).

Computation Steps:
1. **Estimate Future Free Cash Flows (FCF)**: Project future cash flows over a period, typically 5 to 10 years.
2. **Determine the Terminal [Value](../v/value.md) (TV)**: Estimate the company's [value](../v/value.md) at the end of the projection period.
3. **[Discount](../d/discount.md) Future Cash Flows and Terminal [Value](../v/value.md)**: Apply the WACC to [discount](../d/discount.md) the projected cash flows and terminal [value](../v/value.md) to the [present value](../p/present_value.md).
4. **Sum of Present Values (PV)**: Add the discounted cash flows and terminal [value](../v/value.md) to arrive at the total [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) of the company.

\[ \text{DCF} = \sum \frac{FCF_t}{(1 + WACC)^t} + \frac{TV}{(1 + WACC)^n} \]

Where \( t \) is the time period, and \( n \) represents the last period in the projection horizon.

#### Dividend Discount Model (DDM)

The [Dividend](../d/dividend.md) [Discount](../d/discount.md) Model (DDM) is another popular [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) model. It is predominantly used for companies that pay regular dividends. The DDM estimates the [value](../v/value.md) of a stock based on the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of its expected future dividends.

Computation Steps:
1. **Forecast Dividends**: Estimate the dividends that the company [will](../w/will.md) pay in the future.
2. **[Discount](../d/discount.md) to [Present Value](../p/present_value.md)**: Apply a [discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md), typically the required [rate of return](../r/rate_of_return.md), to [discount](../d/discount.md) the future dividends back to their [present value](../p/present_value.md).

The basic formula for the [Gordon Growth Model](../g/gordon_growth_model.md), a simple form of DDM, is:

\[ P_0 = \frac{D_0 (1+g)}{r - g} \]

Where \( P_0 \) is the current stock price, \( D_0 \) is the current [dividend](../d/dividend.md), \( g \) is the growth rate of dividends, and \( r \) is the required [rate of return](../r/rate_of_return.md).

#### Residual Income Model (RIM)

The [Residual Income](../r/residual_income.md) Model (RIM) values a company based on the concept of [residual income](../r/residual_income.md), which is the [income](../i/income.md) left over after [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for a mandatory [return](../r/return.md) on [capital](../c/capital.md). It is particularly useful for companies that do not pay dividends or generate negative cash flows.

Computation Steps:
1. **Calculate [Residual Income](../r/residual_income.md)**: Subtract the [equity](../e/equity.md) charge (the required [return](../r/return.md) on [equity](../e/equity.md)) from the net [income](../i/income.md).
2. **[Discount](../d/discount.md) to [Present Value](../p/present_value.md)**: [Discount](../d/discount.md) the future residual incomes to their [present value](../p/present_value.md) using the required [return](../r/return.md) on [equity](../e/equity.md).

[Residual Income](../r/residual_income.md) is computed as:

\[ RI_t = NI_t - r_e \times B_{t-1} \]

Where \( NI_t \) is the net [income](../i/income.md) for period \( t \), \( r_e \) is the [cost of equity](../c/cost_of_equity.md), and \( B_{t-1} \) is the [book value](../b/book_value.md) of [equity](../e/equity.md) at the start of period \( t \).

### Applications of Intrinsic Value Models

#### Stock Valuation

[Intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) models are widely used in the [valuation](../v/valuation.md) of [stocks](../s/stock.md). Investors and analysts rely on these models to derive the fair price of a stock and make informed buy or sell decisions. For example, if an [investor](../i/investor.md) uses the DCF model and determines that the [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) of a stock is $150, but the current [market price](../m/market_price.md) is $120, the stock is considered [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md), prompting a buy recommendation.

#### Corporate Finance

In [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md), [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) models are essential tools for [capital budgeting](../c/capital_budgeting.md) and investment decisions. Companies use these models to evaluate the feasibility of new projects, mergers, and acquisitions. The models help in assessing whether the expected benefits of a project or [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) outweigh its costs.

#### Strategic Planning and Decision Making

Corporate executives and boards of directors use [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) models for strategic planning and making critical [business](../b/business.md) decisions. By understanding the [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) of their company's divisions or potential acquisitions, executives can make informed choices that align with long-term [value](../v/value.md) creation.

### Case Studies and Practical Examples

#### Case Study: Google's Acquisition of YouTube

In 2006, Google acquired YouTube for $1.65 billion. To justify this [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md), Google's financial analysts likely used [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) models such as DCF to evaluate YouTube's future cash flows and growth potential. The strategic fit, [market](../m/market.md) potential, and synergy benefits were also taken into account, leading to the conclusion that YouTube's [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) justified the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) price.

#### Practical Example: Valuation of Apple Inc.

Consider an [investor](../i/investor.md) attempting to determine the [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) of Apple Inc. using the DCF model. The steps involved would include:

1. **Estimating Future Cash Flows**: Projecting Apple's free cash flows for the next 10 years based on historical performance and [market](../m/market.md) expectations.
2. **Calculating Terminal [Value](../v/value.md)**: Estimating Appleâ€™s [value](../v/value.md) at the end of the projection period using a [perpetuity](../p/perpetuity.md) growth model.
3. **[Discounting](../d/discounting.md) Cash Flows**: Applying Apple's WACC to [discount](../d/discount.md) future cash flows and the terminal [value](../v/value.md) to [present value](../p/present_value.md).
4. **Summing Present Values**: Adding the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of projected cash flows and the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of the terminal [value](../v/value.md) to arrive at Apple's [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md).

### Challenges and Limitations

While [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) models are powerful tools, they come with several challenges and limitations:

#### Data Accuracy

The accuracy of [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) models heavily depends on the reliability and precision of the input data. Inaccurate [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md), forecast errors, or incorrect assumptions can lead to significant deviations in the estimated [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md).

#### Subjectivity in Assumptions

[Intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) models require several assumptions, such as [discount](../d/discount.md) rates, [growth rates](../g/growth_rates_in_trading.md), and future cash flows. These assumptions are subjective and can vary widely among analysts, leading to different [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) estimates for the same [asset](../a/asset.md).

#### Market Volatility

[Financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) are volatile, and [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) models may not adequately capture sudden changes in [market](../m/market.md) conditions, regulatory environments, or macroeconomic factors. As a result, the [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) estimate might not reflect real-time [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md).

#### Model Complexity

Some [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) models, like DCF, involve complex calculations that require deep financial knowledge and expertise. This complexity can make these models challenging to apply, especially for retail investors or those with limited financial backgrounds.

### Conclusion

[Intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) models are indispensable tools in the arsenal of investors, financial analysts, and corporate executives. By focusing on fundamental data and long-term prospects, these models provide a [robust](../r/robust.md) framework for evaluating the true worth of an [asset](../a/asset.md), independent of its current [market price](../m/market_price.md). Despite their challenges and limitations, [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) models continue to play a vital role in investment [valuation](../v/valuation.md), [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md), and strategic decision-making.

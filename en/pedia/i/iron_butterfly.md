# Iron Butterfly

The Iron Butterfly is a popular options trading strategy that involves the use of multiple options trades to create a "wings" structure, which limits both risk and reward. The primary goal of this strategy is to benefit from low volatility by capturing a net premium, while having strictly defined risk parameters. Below, we explore the Iron Butterfly strategy in detail, including its construction, profit and loss potential, breakeven points, and practical use cases.

## Construction of an Iron Butterfly

An Iron Butterfly is constructed using four options with the same expiration date but three different strike prices. The strategy involves:

1. **Buying one out-of-the-money put option (lower strike price)**
2. **Selling one at-the-money put option (middle strike price)**
3. **Selling one at-the-money call option (middle strike price)**
4. **Buying one out-of-the-money call option (higher strike price)**

The middle strike price, where both the put and call options are sold, is typically the current market price of the underlying asset. The out-of-the-money put and call options are purchased to form the wings of the butterfly. The resulting structure appears as follows:

- Long one lower strike put
- Short one middle strike put
- Short one middle strike call
- Long one higher strike call

## Example of Iron Butterfly

Consider a stock trading at $100. Here’s how an Iron Butterfly might be constructed:

- Buy 1 put with a strike price of $95 (out-of-the-money put)
- Sell 1 put with a strike price of $100 (at-the-money put)
- Sell 1 call with a strike price of $100 (at-the-money call)
- Buy 1 call with a strike price of $105 (out-of-the-money call)

## Profit and Loss Potential

The Iron Butterfly's profit and loss profile are both capped. This means that there is a maximum amount you can gain and a maximum amount you can lose. 

### Maximum Profit

The maximum profit is achieved when the underlying asset closes exactly at the middle strike price at expiration. The profit is calculated as:

\( \text{Max Profit} = \text{Net Premium Received} \)

The Net Premium Received is the total premium collected from selling the middle strike call and put, minus the premium paid for buying the out-of-the-money call and [put options](../p/put_options.md).

### Maximum Loss

The maximum loss occurs if the underlying asset’s price moves significantly away from the middle strike price at expiration. The loss is calculated as:

\( \text{Max Loss} = \text{Difference in Strike Prices} - \text{Net Premium Received} \)

In our example:

- Difference in Strike Prices = $105 - $100 = $5 (or $500 per options contract, considering each contract represents 100 shares)

If the Net Premium Received was $2, the Max Loss is:

- \( \text{Max Loss} = $5 - $2 = $3 \text{ (or $300 per options contract)} \)

### Breakeven Points

There are two breakeven points for an Iron Butterfly strategy. They can be calculated as follows:

- Lower Breakeven Point = Middle Strike Price - Net Premium Received
- Upper Breakeven Point = Middle Strike Price + Net Premium Received

In our example:

- Lower Breakeven Point = $100 - $2 = $98
- Upper Breakeven Point = $100 + $2 = $102

## Practical Use Cases

The Iron Butterfly is primarily used in markets where the trader expects low volatility and believes the underlying asset's price will remain close to the current price till expiration. Here are several scenarios where the Iron Butterfly can be beneficial:

- **Earnings Season**: Traders might use Iron Butterflies during earnings season when they predict a company’s stock will not experience major price shifts despite reporting earnings.
- **Historical Price Stability**: If an asset has shown a history of trading within a narrow range, an Iron Butterfly might be employed to capitalize on this lack of movement.
- **Volatility Compression**: In scenarios where traders expect a decrease in implied volatility, selling options (like in Iron Butterfly) can be profitable since options' prices tend to fall with decreasing volatility.

## Risks and Considerations

While the Iron Butterfly offers defined risk, several considerations must be kept in mind:

- **Assignment Risk**: Early assignment of short options positions can occur, especially for American options. This can complicate the strategy and lead to unexpected outcomes.
- **Liquidity Concerns**: Maintaining liquidity is crucial when using an Iron Butterfly to enable easy exit before expiration if needed. Illiquid options can result in wider bid-ask spreads and unexpected slippage.
- **Transaction Costs**: With four legs in the strategy, transaction costs including commissions and fees can be significant, reducing the net premium received.

## Advanced Strategies and Modifications

Professional traders often tweak the Iron Butterfly to suit specific market conditions or risk tolerance levels. Some common modifications include:

- **[Iron Condor](../i/iron_condor.md)**: Similar to Iron Butterfly but with different middle strike prices for sold options, providing a wider range of profitability.
- **Broken Wing Butterfly**: Adjusting strike prices to create asymmetry where one wing is further out-of-the-money than the other, modifying risk and reward profiles.

## Conclusion

The Iron Butterfly is a strategic approach for options traders who anticipate minimal movement in the underlying asset’s price. By understanding its construction, profit/loss dynamics, and breakeven points, traders can implement this strategy effectively to take advantage of periods of low volatility while maintaining controlled risk exposure. However, it requires meticulous planning, risk assessment, and an understanding of the underlying mechanics to be used successfully.

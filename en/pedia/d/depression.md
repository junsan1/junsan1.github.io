# Depression

Depression is one of the most common mental health disorders, affecting millions of people worldwide. It's a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of [interest](../i/interest.md). It can interfere with a person's daily functioning and lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems. In this article, we [will](../w/will.md) explore what depression is, its symptoms, causes, diagnosis, treatment [options](../o/options.md), and ways to cope.

## What is Depression?

Depression, also known as major depressive disorder (MDD), is a medical condition that negatively affects how you feel, think, and act. Unlike regular sadness or grief, depression is a prolonged state that does not simply go away with time. It's essential to recognize that depression is not a sign of weakness, and it's not something you can "snap out" of by trying harder. It is a serious condition that requires professional treatment.

## Symptoms of Depression

Depression symptoms can vary from person to person, but there are some common emotional and physical signs to watch for:

### Emotional Symptoms
- Persistent sad or “empty” mood
- Feelings of hopelessness or pessimism
- Irritability or frustration, even over small matters
- Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness
- Loss of [interest](../i/interest.md) or pleasure in hobbies and activities
- Difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions
- Thoughts of death or suicide, or suicide attempts

### Physical Symptoms
- Fatigue or decreased energy
- Insomnia, early-morning awakening, or sleeping too much
- Changes in appetite – weight loss or [gain](../g/gain.md) unrelated to dieting
- Aches, pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems without a clear physical cause that do not ease even with treatment

## Causes of Depression

Depression can result from a combination of genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors. Common causes include:

### Genetic Factors
Depression can run in families, indicating a hereditary component. If you have family members with depression, you may be at higher [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Biological Factors
Changes in brain chemistry, structure, and function can contribute to depression. Neurotransmitters like serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine play a significant role in mood regulation.

### Environmental Factors
Life events such as trauma, loss of a loved one, a difficult relationship, or any stressful situation can trigger depression. Economic factors like [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) or [poverty](../p/poverty.md) can also contribute.

### Psychological Factors
People with low self-esteem, who are easily overwhelmed by stress, or who have a generally pessimistic outlook on life may be more prone to depression.

## Diagnosis of Depression

To diagnose depression, a healthcare professional, typically a psychologist or psychiatrist, [will](../w/will.md) conduct a thorough evaluation. This may include:

- **Clinical Interview:** Discussing your symptoms, medical history, and family history.
- **Questionnaires:** Utilizing standardized questionnaires to assess the severity of your depression.
- **Physical Exam:** Conducting a physical exam to rule out other medical conditions that might be causing depressive symptoms.
- **Diagnostic Criteria:** Comparing symptoms against the criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) published by the American Psychiatric Association.

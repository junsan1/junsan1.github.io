# Deferred Profit Sharing Plan (DPSP)

A Deferred [Profit](../p/profit.md) Sharing Plan (DPSP) is a type of employer-sponsored retirement plan that allows employees to share in the profits of the company. The contributions to a DPSP are typically made by the employer, and the plan is designed to provide employees with a financial incentive to remain with the company and contribute to its success. DPSPs are more prevalent in Canada, though similar concepts exist in other regions under different names.

### Key Features of DPSP

#### Employer Contributions
One of the defining characteristics of a DPSP is that it is funded entirely by the employer. Contributions are made from the company's profits and allocated to employees’ accounts based on a predetermined formula. This formula can be based on several factors, such as the employee's salary or length of service.

#### Vesting Period
DPSPs often include a [vesting](../v/vesting.md) period, which is a timeframe that employees must work for the company before they [gain](../g/gain.md) full ownership of their DPSP benefits. Until employees are [fully vested](../f/fully_vested.md), their benefits may be forfeited if they leave the company. [Vesting](../v/vesting.md) periods vary by plan and can [range](../r/range.md) from immediate [vesting](../v/vesting.md) to several years.

#### Tax-Deferred Growth
In a DPSP, contributions and investment [earnings](../e/earnings.md) grow on a [tax-deferred](../t/tax_deferred.md) [basis](../b/basis.md). This means that employees do not pay [taxes](../t/taxes.md) on the contributions or the investment gains until they withdraw funds, typically during retirement when they might be in a lower tax bracket.

#### Investment Choices
Employers often provide a [range](../r/range.md) of investment [options](../o/options.md) within a DPSP, allowing employees to choose how their funds are invested. Common [options](../o/options.md) include various mutual funds, [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, and other financial instruments. Some employers may [offer](../o/offer.md) professional [investment management](../i/investment_management.md) services to help employees make informed decisions.

#### Withdrawal Rules
Withdrawals from a DPSP are usually permitted under specific conditions, such as retirement, [termination of employment](../t/termination_of_employment.md), or reaching a certain age. Early withdrawals might be subject to penalties and [taxes](../t/taxes.md), depending on the terms of the plan and local regulations.

### Advantages of DPSP

#### Encourages Employee Loyalty
By [tying](../t/tying.md) a portion of employees’ retirement savings to the company's performance, DPSPs incentivize employees to remain with the company longer and contribute to its profitability. The [vesting](../v/vesting.md) period further enhances this loyalty by ensuring that employees must stay for a certain period to fully benefit from the plan.

#### Tax Advantages
DPSPs [offer](../o/offer.md) significant tax benefits. Contributions made by the employer are tax-deductible, reducing the company's [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md). For employees, [taxes](../t/taxes.md) on contributions and investment gains are deferred until [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md), which can result in substantial tax savings and [compounding](../c/compounding.md) growth over time.

#### Employee Motivation
Linking a portion of employee compensation to company profitability can increase motivation and [productivity](../p/productivity.md). Employees may feel more invested in the success of the company, knowing that it directly impacts their financial future.

#### Retirement Security
DPSPs contribute to an employee's overall retirement savings, providing an additional source of [income](../i/income.md) in retirement alongside other savings and government benefits.

### Disadvantages of DPSP

#### Potential for Uneven Contributions
Since contributions are based on company profits, they can vary significantly from year to year. In profitable years, contributions may be substantial, while in less profitable years, contributions might be minimal or nonexistent, leading to [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) in [retirement planning](../r/retirement_planning.md).

#### Vesting Risk
Employees who leave the company before they are [fully vested](../f/fully_vested.md) may lose some or all of their DPSP benefits. This [risk](../r/risk.md) can be a significant downside for employees who are not planning to stay with the company for the long term.

#### Limited Control
While employees can often choose their investments within a DPSP, their overall control is limited compared to other retirement accounts where they might have more direct control over contributions and investment decisions.

### Regulations and Compliance

#### Canadian Regulations
In Canada, DPSPs are governed by the [Income Tax](../i/income_tax.md) Act and must comply with various regulations to maintain their [tax-advantaged](../t/tax-advantaged.md) status. For example, there are limits on the amount of contributions that can be made to the plan and specific rules on [vesting](../v/vesting.md) and withdrawals.

#### Reporting Requirements
Employers must adhere to strict reporting requirements, including filing annual information returns with the Canada [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Agency (CRA) and providing employees with statements detailing their DPSP benefits.

#### Legal and Fiduciary Responsibilities
Employers that [offer](../o/offer.md) a DPSP assume significant legal and fiduciary responsibilities. They must act in the best interests of their employees, ensuring that the plan is managed prudently and in compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.

### Implementation and Management

#### Setting Up a DPSP
To set up a DPSP, an employer must draft a plan document that outlines the terms and conditions of the plan, including the contribution formula, [vesting](../v/vesting.md) schedule, investment [options](../o/options.md), and [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) rules. The plan document must be approved by the CRA to ensure it complies with all regulatory requirements.

#### Communication and Education
Effective communication and education are crucial for a successful DPSP. Employers must ensure that employees understand how the plan works, the benefits it provides, and the investment [options](../o/options.md) available. Regular updates and educational sessions can help employees make informed decisions about their DPSP investments.

#### Monitoring and Review
Ongoing monitoring and review of the DPSP are essential to ensure it remains compliant with regulations and continues to meet the needs of both the employer and employees. Employers should periodically review the plan's performance, make necessary adjustments, and consider employee feedback to improve the plan.

### Notable Companies Offering DPSPs

Several notable companies [offer](../o/offer.md) DPSPs as part of their employee benefits package. These companies recognize the [value](../v/value.md) of DPSPs in attracting and retaining top talent, motivating employees, and providing a secure retirement future. Examples include:

### Conclusion

Deferred [Profit](../p/profit.md) Sharing Plans (DPSPs) [offer](../o/offer.md) a compelling way for employers to share their success with employees while providing [tax-advantaged](../t/tax-advantaged.md) retirement savings. The structure of DPSPs encourages employee loyalty, enhances motivation, and contributes to long-term financial [security](../s/security.md). However, potential disadvantages such as variable contributions and [vesting](../v/vesting.md) risks require careful consideration. Employers implementing DPSPs must ensure compliance with regulations, provide clear communication and education, and regularly review the plan to maintain its effectiveness and alignment with company goals.

# Dubai Financial Market (DFM)

The Dubai Financial Market (DFM) is one of the leading financial markets in the Middle East, specifically based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Established on March 26, 2000, DFM operates as a secondary market for trading securities issued by public joint stock companies, bonds issued by the federal government or any of the local governments and public sector institutions in the country, investment units issued by local investment funds, and any other financial instruments, local or foreign, which are accepted by the market.

## Overview and Structure

### Establishment and Ownership

The Dubai Financial Market was inaugurated by the decree of Mohammad Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai, to facilitate the trading of securities and attract investments. It was established to offer traders, both local and international, opportunities to invest in the United Arab Emiratesâ€™ burgeoning economy. Initially, DFM was a government entity, but it later went public with its own shares listed on the exchange. Now, both institutional and individual investors can trade in a variety of securities on the platform.

### Market Segments

DFM operates multiple market segments, including:

1. **Equity Market**: This segment includes trading shares of public joint stock companies. Companies listed on the DFM are typically categorized based on sectors such as real estate, banking, insurance, telecommunications, transportation, and others.
   
2. **Debt Market**: This includes the trading of bonds and sukuk (Islamic bonds) issued by corporations, the federal government, or local public sector institutions. 

3. **ETF Market**: Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in various sectors are also traded on the DFM, providing investors with diversified risk.

4. **Derivatives Market**: Launched later as a move to diversify its offerings, the derivatives market includes futures and options.

### Trading Procedures

DFM operates in line with international practices with a fully automated electronic trading system. The trading process is divided into several stages:

1. **Pre-Trading Session**: Order entry but no matching occurs.
   
2. **Opening Auction**: Orders are matched and it determines the opening prices for securities.
   
3. **Continuous Trading**: Regular trading takes place during this session.
   
4. **Post-Trading Session**: Includes a closing auction to determine the closing price of the securities, followed by a session where closing prices are confirmed and official reports are generated.
   
5. **Settlement and Clearing**: The settlement process in DFM follows a "T+2" cycle, meaning the transaction is settled two business days after the trade date.

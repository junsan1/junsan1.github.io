# Double Taxation

Double [taxation](../t/taxation.md) is a tax principle referring to [income](../i/income.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) paid twice on the same source of [earned income](../e/earned_income.md). It most commonly occurs when [income](../i/income.md) is taxed at both the corporate level and personal level. Double [taxation](../t/taxation.md) can also happen in international [trade](../t/trade.md) or investment when the same [income](../i/income.md) is taxed in two different jurisdictions. Various measures are used to mitigate double [taxation](../t/taxation.md), including tax treaties, tax credits, and exemptions.

## Types of Double Taxation

- **Corporate Double [Taxation](../t/taxation.md)**: Occurs when a [corporation](../c/corporation.md)'s [income](../i/income.md) is taxed first at the corporate level and then again at the [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) level when dividends are distributed.

- **International Double [Taxation](../t/taxation.md)**: Occurs when the same [income](../i/income.md) is taxed in two different countries, typically when a resident earns [income](../i/income.md) from a foreign source.

## Corporate Double Taxation

### Explanation

Corporate double [taxation](../t/taxation.md) is one of the most commonly encountered forms of double [taxation](../t/taxation.md). Here's how it works:

1. A [corporation](../c/corporation.md) earns [income](../i/income.md) and pays corporate [income tax](../i/income_tax.md) on that [income](../i/income.md).
2. The [after-tax income](../a/after-tax_income.md) is then distributed as dividends to shareholders.
3. Shareholders then pay [personal income](../p/personal_income.md) tax on the dividends they receive.

### Example

Imagine a [corporation](../c/corporation.md) that earns $100,000 in [profit](../p/profit.md). If the [corporate tax](../c/corporate_tax.md) rate is 30%, the [corporation](../c/corporation.md) pays $30,000 in [taxes](../t/taxes.md), leaving $70,000. If the [corporation](../c/corporation.md) distributes these $70,000 as dividends and the [personal income](../p/personal_income.md) [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md) on dividends is 25%, shareholders pay $17,500 in [taxes](../t/taxes.md). The total tax paid is $47,500, which is nearly 50% of the original [income](../i/income.md), exemplifying double [taxation](../t/taxation.md).

### Mitigation Measures

#### Tax Credits

One method to mitigate double [taxation](../t/taxation.md) is through tax credits, wherein the tax paid at the corporate level can be credited against the tax owed by shareholders. For example, if a [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) receives a $70,000 [dividend](../d/dividend.md) and has already been taxed $30,000 at the corporate level, they might only owe [taxes](../t/taxes.md) on the remaining $40,000.

#### Lower Dividend Tax Rates

Some jurisdictions [offer](../o/offer.md) lower tax rates on [dividend](../d/dividend.md) [income](../i/income.md) to mitigate the effects of double [taxation](../t/taxation.md). For example, in the United States, qualified dividends are taxed at a lower [capital gains tax](../c/capital_gains_tax.md) rate rather than the higher [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md) [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md).

#### Pass-Through Entities

Certain types of [business](../b/business.md) structures, such as S corporations and [Limited Liability](../l/limited_liability.md) Companies (LLCs), allow [income](../i/income.md) to "pass through" directly to owners or shareholders, thereby avoiding corporate-level [taxation](../t/taxation.md). This pass-through structure ensures that [income](../i/income.md) is only taxed at the personal level.

## International Double Taxation

International double [taxation](../t/taxation.md) occurs when the same [income](../i/income.md) is taxed by two different countries. This is especially complex due to the varying tax laws in different jurisdictions.

### Example

A U.S. resident working abroad may be subject to [income tax](../i/income_tax.md) in both the U.S. and the foreign country where they are employed. If the foreign country has a [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md) similar to the U.S., it could result in a significant portion of the individual's [earnings](../e/earnings.md) being taxed away.

### International Agreements and Treaties

#### Double Taxation Agreements (DTAs)

Many countries have entered into Double [Taxation](../t/taxation.md) Agreements (DTAs) to avoid taxing the same [income](../i/income.md) twice. These treaties stipulate which country has the right to tax certain types of [income](../i/income.md), and often provide methods to reduce or eliminate double [taxation](../t/taxation.md). For example:

- **Tax Credits**: The foreign tax paid can be credited against the domestic [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md).
- **Exemptions**: Some treaties provide exemptions from tax on particular types of [income](../i/income.md).
- **Reduced Rates**: Agreements to apply lower tax rates on specific [income](../i/income.md) categories like dividends, [interest](../i/interest.md), and royalties.

#### Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE)

In the United States, the [Foreign Earned Income Exclusion](../f/foreign_earned_income_exclusion.md) (FEIE) allows U.S. citizens living abroad to exclude a certain amount of their foreign-[earned income](../e/earned_income.md) from U.S. [taxation](../t/taxation.md), helping mitigate double [taxation](../t/taxation.md).

### Transfer Pricing

[Transfer pricing](../t/transfer_price.md) refers to the rules and methods for pricing transactions within and between enterprises under common ownership or control. It is significant in the international [taxation](../t/taxation.md) of multinational corporations. Incorrect [transfer pricing](../t/transfer_price.md) practices can lead to double [taxation](../t/taxation.md) if tax authorities in two countries adjust prices and both impose tax based on their adjustments.

### Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC) Rules

Controlled Foreign [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) (CFC) rules are part of anti-avoidance measures that aim to prevent companies from shifting [income](../i/income.md) to foreign subsidiaries in low-tax jurisdictions. These rules often result in the foreign subsidiary's [income](../i/income.md) being taxed in the [parent company](../p/parent_company.md)'s country, leading to potential double [taxation](../t/taxation.md) unless mitigated by credits or treaties.

## Impact on Businesses and Investment

Double [taxation](../t/taxation.md) can have significant implications for businesses and investors:

- **Investment Decisions**: Double [taxation](../t/taxation.md) can deter [foreign investment](../f/foreign_investment.md) and affect decisions regarding where to incorporate a [business](../b/business.md).
- **Compliance Costs**: Managing and complying with double [taxation](../t/taxation.md) can increase the administrative burden and costs for businesses.
- **[Profit Distribution](../p/profit_distribution.md)**: Double [taxation](../t/taxation.md) can lower the net returns for investors, affecting their investment strategies and portfolio allocation.

## Real-World Examples

### Google and Alphabet Inc.

Google's [parent company](../p/parent_company.md), Alphabet Inc., has faced double [taxation](../t/taxation.md) issues, especially concerning its international operations. To manage this, Alphabet employs various strategies, including the use of Double Irish and Dutch Sandwich tax structures. These strategies involve routing profits through various subsidiaries in different jurisdictions to minimize the overall [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md), although they can still encounter double [taxation](../t/taxation.md) due to varying national laws.

### Oracle Corporation

Oracle [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) has also dealt with double [taxation](../t/taxation.md) concerns, particularly regarding its overseas revenues. The company has structured its operations to take advantage of tax treaties and credits to mitigate double [taxation](../t/taxation.md) as effectively as possible. For more information on Oracle's approach to [taxation](../t/taxation.md), you can visit their [official site](https://www.oracle.com).

## Conclusion

Double [taxation](../t/taxation.md) is a complex [issue](../i/issue.md) affecting corporations and individuals in both domestic and international contexts. While measures like tax credits, exemptions, reduced rates, and international treaties [offer](../o/offer.md) some relief, navigating the intricacies of double [taxation](../t/taxation.md) requires careful planning and compliance. The impacts on investment decisions, corporate strategies, and global [business](../b/business.md) operations underscore the importance of understanding and managing double [taxation](../t/taxation.md) effectively.

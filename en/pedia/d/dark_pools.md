# Dark Pools

### Introduction
Dark pools are private financial forums or exchanges for trading securities. They allow investors, particularly institutional investors, to [trade](../t/trade.md) large blocks of [shares](../s/shares.md) without the transactions impacting the public markets until after the [trade](../t/trade.md) has been executed. This feature helps investors to avoid [market](../m/market.md) impact, which typically results in adverse price movements when significant trades are disclosed to the public [market](../m/market.md).

### Types of Dark Pools
1. **[Broker-Dealer](../b/broker-dealer.md) Owned Dark Pools**: These are operated by large [broker](../b/broker.md)-dealers like Barclays [Capital](../c/capital.md)'s LX [Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) Cross and [Credit](../c/credit.md) Suisse's CrossFinder. They [offer](../o/offer.md) their clients, often large institutional ones, a venue to execute trades with minimal [market](../m/market.md) impact.
2. **Agency [Broker](../b/broker.md) or [Exchange](../e/exchange.md)-Owned Dark Pools**: Examples include ITG's POSIT and Liquidnet. These are typically operated by specialized agencies or exchanges and cater to a broader set of participants.
3. **Electronic [Market Maker](../m/market_maker.md)-Owned Dark Pools**: Operated by high-frequency trading firms, such as those run by Virtu Financial. They also aim to [offer](../o/offer.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) but usually target high-frequency trades.

### How Dark Pools Work
Dark pools execute trades at prices determined by the midpoint of the national best [bid](../b/bid.md) and [offer](../o/offer.md) (NBBO), meaning the average of the highest [bid price](../b/bid_price.md) and the lowest [offer](../o/offer.md) price from across all exchanges. Orders placed in dark pools are not visible to the public, thus here are typical steps involved:
1. **Private [Negotiation](../n/negotiation.md)**: The buyer and seller agree on the amount of the [trade](../t/trade.md) and a price.
2. **[Order](../o/order.md) Submission**: The details of the [order](../o/order.md) are submitted to the [dark pool](../d/dark_pool.md).
3. **Matching**: The [dark pool](../d/dark_pool.md) matches the [order](../o/order.md) with a counter-[order](../o/order.md).
4. **[Execution](../e/execution.md)**: The [trade](../t/trade.md) is executed and reported to the relevant regulatory authorities but generally not included in the public [order book](../o/order_book.md) until after [execution](../e/execution.md).

### Advantages of Dark Pools
- **Reduced [Market](../m/market.md) Impact**: Large trades can move [market](../m/market.md) prices unfavorably if others see the trades being conducted. Dark pools mitigate this by hiding trades until they are complete.
- **Increased Anonymity**: Participants can place large orders without revealing their identity, reducing the [risk](../r/risk.md) of information [leakage](../l/leakage.md).
- **Potential for Better Pricing**: The midpoint pricing mechanism can sometimes [yield](../y/yield.md) better prices for large transactions.

### Disadvantages and Criticism
- **Lack of [Transparency](../t/transparency.md)**: Critics argue that dark pools contribute to a lack of [transparency](../t/transparency.md) in the markets, as significant trading [volume](../v/volume.md) occurs out of view.
- **[Price Discovery](../p/price_discovery.md) Impacts**: Since large trades happen away from public exchanges, it can hinder the proper [price discovery](../p/price_discovery.md) mechanism that relies on the [visibility](../v/visibility.md) of all trades.
- **Potential for Manipulation**: The opacity of dark pools can potentially be exploited for manipulative activities like [front-running](../f/front-running.md).

### Regulation
Dark pools have been subject to increasing scrutiny and regulatory measures in various jurisdictions:
- **United States**: The Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) has fined several operators for issues related to [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and the protection of client interests.
- **Europe**: [MiFID II](../m/mifid_ii.md), a legislative framework instituted by the [European Union](../e/european_union_(eu).md), places caps on the amount of trading that can occur in dark pools to ensure fair and transparent markets.

### Notable Dark Pools and Their Operators
1. **Barclays LX**: Operated by Barclays [Capital](../c/capital.md), this [dark pool](../d/dark_pool.md) has been a subject of regulatory scrutiny.
2. **[Credit](../c/credit.md) Suisse CrossFinder**: Managed by [Credit](../c/credit.md) Suisse, it is one of the largest and most active dark pools.
3. **ITG POSIT**: An agency [broker](../b/broker.md) [dark pool](../d/dark_pool.md) that allows participants to execute large trades anonymously.
4. **Liquidnet**: Known for its focus on institutional investors, [offering](../o/offering.md) a platform to [trade](../t/trade.md) large blocks without revealing the [trade](../t/trade.md) details to the [market](../m/market.md).

### Conclusion
Dark pools remain a significant yet controversial component of modern [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). While they [offer](../o/offer.md) distinct advantages in terms of reducing [market](../m/market.md) impact and preserving anonymity for large trades, their lack of [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and potential effects on [market](../m/market.md) mechanics are points of ongoing debate and regulation. As [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) continues to evolve, the role and regulation of dark pools are likely to remain dynamic and closely watched by [market](../m/market.md) participants and regulators alike.

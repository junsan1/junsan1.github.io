# Dark Pools

### Introduction
Dark pools are private financial forums or exchanges for trading securities. They allow investors, particularly institutional investors, to trade large blocks of shares without the transactions impacting the public markets until after the trade has been executed. This feature helps investors to avoid market impact, which typically results in adverse price movements when significant trades are disclosed to the public market.

### Types of Dark Pools
1. **Broker-Dealer Owned Dark Pools**: These are operated by large broker-dealers like Barclays Capital's LX Liquidity Cross and Credit Suisse's CrossFinder. They offer their clients, often large institutional ones, a venue to execute trades with minimal market impact.
2. **Agency Broker or Exchange-Owned Dark Pools**: Examples include ITG's POSIT and Liquidnet. These are typically operated by specialized agencies or exchanges and cater to a broader set of participants.
3. **Electronic Market Maker-Owned Dark Pools**: Operated by high-frequency trading firms, such as those run by Virtu Financial. They also aim to offer liquidity but usually target high-frequency trades.

### How Dark Pools Work
Dark pools execute trades at prices determined by the midpoint of the national best bid and offer (NBBO), meaning the average of the highest bid price and the lowest offer price from across all exchanges. Orders placed in dark pools are not visible to the public, thus here are typical steps involved:
1. **Private Negotiation**: The buyer and seller agree on the amount of the trade and a price.
2. **Order Submission**: The details of the order are submitted to the dark pool.
3. **Matching**: The dark pool matches the order with a counter-order.
4. **Execution**: The trade is executed and reported to the relevant regulatory authorities but generally not included in the public order book until after execution.

### Advantages of Dark Pools
- **Reduced Market Impact**: Large trades can move market prices unfavorably if others see the trades being conducted. Dark pools mitigate this by hiding trades until they are complete.
- **Increased Anonymity**: Participants can place large orders without revealing their identity, reducing the risk of information leakage.
- **Potential for Better Pricing**: The midpoint pricing mechanism can sometimes yield better prices for large transactions.

### Disadvantages and Criticism
- **Lack of Transparency**: Critics argue that dark pools contribute to a lack of transparency in the markets, as significant trading volume occurs out of view.
- **Price Discovery Impacts**: Since large trades happen away from public exchanges, it can hinder the proper price discovery mechanism that relies on the visibility of all trades.
- **Potential for Manipulation**: The opacity of dark pools can potentially be exploited for manipulative activities like [front-running](../f/front-running.md).

### Regulation
Dark pools have been subject to increasing scrutiny and regulatory measures in various jurisdictions:
- **United States**: The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has fined several operators for issues related to transparency and the protection of client interests.
- **Europe**: MiFID II, a legislative framework instituted by the European Union, places caps on the amount of trading that can occur in dark pools to ensure fair and transparent markets.

### Conclusion
Dark pools remain a significant yet controversial component of modern financial markets. While they offer distinct advantages in terms of reducing market impact and preserving anonymity for large trades, their lack of transparency and potential effects on market mechanics are points of ongoing debate and regulation.

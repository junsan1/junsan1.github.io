# Discount Bond

A [discount](../d/discount.md) [bond](../b/bond.md), also known as a [zero-coupon bond](../z/zero-coupon_bond.md), is a type of [debt security](../d/debt_security.md) that is issued below its [face value](../f/face_value.md) and pays no [interest](../i/interest.md) (coupon) over its lifetime. Instead, investors realize a [gain](../g/gain.md) when the [bond](../b/bond.md) matures and they receive the [face value](../f/face_value.md). These bonds are prominent in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and [offer](../o/offer.md) unique characteristics beneficial for certain investment strategies, including those used in [quantitative finance](../q/quantitative_finance.md) and [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md).

## Introduction to Discount Bonds

[Discount](../d/discount.md) bonds are fundamentally different from traditional coupon-bearing bonds. In a coupon-bearing [bond](../b/bond.md), the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) makes periodic [interest](../i/interest.md) payments to the [bondholder](../b/bondholder.md). In contrast, [discount](../d/discount.md) bonds are sold at a price less than their [face value](../f/face_value.md) (or [par value](../p/par_value.md)), and no periodic [interest](../i/interest.md) payments are made. The [return](../r/return.md) to the [investor](../i/investor.md) is the difference between the purchase price and the amount received at [maturity](../m/maturity.md).

### Key Features of Discount Bonds

1. **Zero Coupon [Payment](../p/payment.md)**: These bonds do not make periodic [interest](../i/interest.md) payments. Instead, the [investor](../i/investor.md) receives a single [payment](../p/payment.md) at [maturity](../m/maturity.md), which includes the [interest](../i/interest.md) earned.
2. **Issued at a [Discount](../d/discount.md)**: They are sold at a price lower than their [par value](../p/par_value.md).
3. **[Maturity](../m/maturity.md) [Value](../v/value.md)**: At [maturity](../m/maturity.md), the [bondholder](../b/bondholder.md) is paid the [face value](../f/face_value.md).
4. **[Yield](../y/yield.md) Calculation**: The [yield to maturity](../y/yield_to_maturity.md) (YTM) is determined by the difference between the purchase price and the [face value](../f/face_value.md), spread over the time to [maturity](../m/maturity.md).

### Example of Discount Bonds
- **[U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) Bills (T-Bills)**: These are short-term securities issued by the U.S. government and typically have maturities of one year or less. T-Bills do not pay regular [interest](../i/interest.md) but are sold at a [discount](../d/discount.md) to their [face value](../f/face_value.md).

## Pricing of Discount Bonds

### Determining the Price

The price of a [discount](../d/discount.md) [bond](../b/bond.md) is determined by the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of its [maturity](../m/maturity.md) [value](../v/value.md). The equation used for pricing a [discount](../d/discount.md) [bond](../b/bond.md) is:

\[ P = \frac{F}{(1 + r)^n} \]

where:
- \( P \) is the price of the [bond](../b/bond.md),
- \( F \) is the [face value](../f/face_value.md) of the [bond](../b/bond.md),
- \( r \) is the [discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md) or [yield](../y/yield.md),
- \( n \) is the number of periods until [maturity](../m/maturity.md).

### Example Calculation

Consider a [discount](../d/discount.md) [bond](../b/bond.md) with a [face value](../f/face_value.md) of $1,000, a [discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md) of 5%, and a [maturity](../m/maturity.md) of 3 years:

\[ P = \frac{1000}{(1 + 0.05)^3} = \frac{1000}{1.157625} \approx 863.84 \]

So, the [bond](../b/bond.md) would be priced at approximately $863.84.

## Yield to Maturity (YTM)

The YTM of a [discount](../d/discount.md) [bond](../b/bond.md) is the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) that makes the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s future cash flows equal to the price of the [bond](../b/bond.md). Since there are no periodic [interest](../i/interest.md) payments, the YTM for a [discount](../d/discount.md) [bond](../b/bond.md) is calculated using:

\[ YTM = \left( \frac{F}{P} \right)^{\frac{1}{n}} - 1 \]

Using the previous example, if the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s price is $863.84, [face value](../f/face_value.md) is $1,000, and time to [maturity](../m/maturity.md) is 3 years:

\[ YTM = \left( \frac{1000}{863.84} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}} - 1 = 1.05 - 1 = 0.05 \text{ or } 5\% \]

## Applications in Algorithmic Trading

In [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), [discount](../d/discount.md) bonds can be used for various strategies, primarily in [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) and hedging. Algorithms are designed to exploit price discrepancies and [market](../m/market.md) inefficiencies. Here is how they can be applied:

### Arbitrage Strategies

1. **Cash and Carry [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**:
    - Involves buying the [discount](../d/discount.md) [bond](../b/bond.md) and holding it until [maturity](../m/maturity.md) while simultaneously entering into a [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) to sell the [bond](../b/bond.md)â€™s [face value](../f/face_value.md).
    - The price differential between the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s current price and the future price is exploited.

2. **Reverse Cash and Carry [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**:
    - Involves [short selling](../s/short_selling.md) the [bond](../b/bond.md) and [investing](../i/investing.md) the proceeds in a [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate until the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s [maturity](../m/maturity.md).

### Hedging Strategies

Algorithmic traders use [discount](../d/discount.md) bonds to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) risks, [currency](../c/currency.md) risks, and other financial risks. For instance:
- **[Interest Rate Risk Management](../i/interest_rate_risk_management.md)**:
    - [Discount](../d/discount.md) bonds can be included in a portfolio to adjust its [duration](../d/duration.md), thereby managing exposure to [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) movements.

### Liability-Driven Investment (LDI) Strategies

Pension funds and [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies use [discount](../d/discount.md) bonds to match their [long-term liabilities](../l/long-term_liabilities.md). By holding these bonds, they ensure that they have predictable future cash flows to meet their [obligations](../o/obligation.md).

## Key Players and Instruments

### Major Issuers
1. **Government Securities**:
    - Governments around the world [issue](../i/issue.md) [discount](../d/discount.md) bonds, such as T-Bills in the United States, to [finance](../f/finance.md) short-term needs.
  
2. **Corporations**:
    - Some corporations [issue](../i/issue.md) zero-coupon bonds to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) without the need for periodic [interest](../i/interest.md) payments.

### Major Traders and Platforms

1. **Trading Platforms**:
    - **[Bloomberg Terminal](../b/bloomberg_terminal.md) (https://www.[bloomberg](../b/bloomberg.md).com/professional/solution/[bloomberg](../b/bloomberg.md)-terminal/)**: Provides real-time data, news, analytics, and facilitates trading of [discount](../d/discount.md) bonds.
    - **Tradeweb (https://www.tradeweb.com/)**: An online platform for trading [fixed income securities](../f/fixed_income_securities.md), including [discount](../d/discount.md) bonds.

2. **[Investment Banks](../i/investment_bank_(ib).md) and Financial Institutions**:
    - Major financial institutions engage in trading and [market](../m/market.md)-making for [discount](../d/discount.md) bonds.
    - Examples include **Goldman Sachs (https://www.goldmansachs.com/)**, **J.P. Morgan (https://www.jpmorgan.com/)**, and **Morgan Stanley (https://www.morganstanley.com/)**.

## Risks and Considerations

### Interest Rate Risk

[Discount](../d/discount.md) bonds are highly sensitive to changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. An increase in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates [will](../w/will.md) result in a decrease in the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s price and vice versa. 

### Reinvestment Risk

Since [discount](../d/discount.md) bonds do not [offer](../o/offer.md) periodic [interest](../i/interest.md) payments, they do not pose [reinvestment risk](../r/reinvestment_risk.md) during their term. However, investors face [reinvestment risk](../r/reinvestment_risk.md) when the [bond](../b/bond.md) matures and they seek to reinvest the [principal](../p/principal.md) at prevailing rates.

### Credit Risk

Though it is generally low for government-issued bonds, for corporate [discount](../d/discount.md) bonds, there is a [risk](../r/risk.md) that the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) might [default](../d/default.md), and the [bondholder](../b/bondholder.md) may not receive the [face value](../f/face_value.md) at [maturity](../m/maturity.md).

### Liquidity Risk

Some [discount](../d/discount.md) bonds, particularly those with longer maturities, can suffer from [illiquidity](../i/illiquid.md). Investors might find it challenging to sell these bonds at their [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) before [maturity](../m/maturity.md).

## Conclusion

[Discount](../d/discount.md) bonds provide a unique [investment vehicle](../i/investment_vehicle.md) with distinct characteristics and advantages. They are essential tools for various [market](../m/market.md) participants, including arbitrageurs, hedgers, and institutional investors. With their zero-coupon nature, they [offer](../o/offer.md) a different [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md) profile compared to traditional coupon-bearing bonds. Understanding the pricing, [yield](../y/yield.md) calculations, and application in different [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) is crucial for leveraging their potential in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

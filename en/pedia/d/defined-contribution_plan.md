# Defined-Contribution Plan

A defined-contribution (DC) plan is a retirement plan in which the amount of the annual contribution is specified. The most common type of DC plan is the [401(k) plan](../1/401(k)_plan.md). These plans are a popular alternative to the traditional defined-benefit (DB) pension plans that were once the standard form of retirement plan offered by employers.

## Structure of Defined-Contribution Plans

In a defined-contribution plan, the employee, employer, or both make contributions on a regular [basis](../b/basis.md). The final benefits received by the participant depend on the amount contributed and the gains (or losses) of the investments. The contributions can be made from the employee's pretax [income](../i/income.md) or as a part of employee compensation in a post-tax format, subject to applicable tax laws.

Unlike defined-benefit plans, where retirees receive a predetermined monthly amount, defined-contribution plan participants have accounts where the contributions and the investment gains accumulate. The eventual [value](../v/value.md) of the retirement [fund](../f/fund.md) depends on the amounts contributed and the success of investments over time.

## Comparison with Defined-Benefit Plans

- **Defined-Benefit Plans**: In a DB plan, an employer promises a specified pension [payment](../p/payment.md) on retirement based on criteria such as employee's [earnings](../e/earnings.md) history, tenure of service, and age. The employer bears the investment risks and funding responsibilities.
  
- **Defined-Contribution Plans**: In a DC plan, the contribution amount is fixed, but the benefits depend on the investment performance. Here, the individual employee bears the investment risks.

## Types of Defined-Contribution Plans

### 401(k) Plans
Named after the section of the tax code that governs them, 401(k) plans are the most widespread type of defined-contribution plans in the United States. Usually, both employees and employers can make contributions. Employers may also [offer](../o/offer.md) matching contributions. 

### 403(b) Plans
403(b) plans are similar to 401(k) plans but are tailored for employees of public schools, certain non-profits, and some clergy members.

### 457 Plans
457 plans are available for state and local public employees and certain non-[profit](../p/profit.md) organizations. These plans have many features alike to 401(k) plans, but the contributions do not impact other retirement plan limits.

### Thrift Savings Plans (TSP)
The Thrift Savings Plan is a defined-contribution plan for federal employees and members of the uniformed services, including the military. It offers similar benefits to private-sector 401(k) plans.

### SIMPLE and SEP IRA Plans
These plans are intended for small businesses and self-employed individuals. SIMPLE IRA plans allow both employee and employer contributions, while SEP (Simplified Employee Pension) IRAs are funded primarily by the employer.

## Contribution Limits

For defined-contribution plans, there are often limits on how much an individual can contribute initially and on an ongoing [basis](../b/basis.md). For instance, the IRS sets annual contribution limits for 401(k) plans, which are updated periodically. In 2023, the contribution limit for employees participating in 401(k) plans was $22,500, with an additional "catch-up" contribution limit of $7,500 for employees over 50 years of age.

## Investment Choices

Participants in defined-contribution plans can generally direct their own investment choices among the [options](../o/options.md) provided by the plan. These [options](../o/options.md) might include various mutual funds, [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, [money market](../m/money_market.md) funds, and other investment products. The available investment choices typically impact the [range](../r/range.md) of potential returns and risks within the plan. 

Plan providers often [offer](../o/offer.md) resources to assist employees in making informed investment decisions, including educational materials, financial advice, and online tools that provide [wealth](../w/wealth.md) modeling and projection.

## Fiduciary Responsibility

Defined-contribution plans are governed under the Employee Retirement [Income](../i/income.md) [Security](../s/security.md) Act (ERISA) in the United States, which imposes several fiduciary responsibilities on the plan sponsors and managers. These fiduciaries are legally obligated to act in the best interests of the plan participants and beneficiaries. They must ensure that the plan's expenses are reasonable and that the investment [options](../o/options.md) provided are diverse â€” allowing participants to diversify their investments to mitigate [risk](../r/risk.md).

## Pros and Cons of Defined-Contribution Plans

### Pros
- **Portability**: Employees can often roll over funds into a new employer's plan or an individual retirement account (IRA) if they change jobs.
- **Flexibility**: Employees have control over their retirement savings and can choose how much to contribute and where to invest.
- **Employer Contributions**: Many plans include employer contributions or matching, which can significantly boost savings.
  
### Cons
- **Investment [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: Employees bear the [risk](../r/risk.md) of investment losses, and poor investment choices can adversely affect retirement savings.
- **Fees**: High fees can erode the investment returns on contributions.
- **Variable Retirement [Income](../i/income.md)**: Unlike defined-benefit plans, the retirement [income](../i/income.md) from a defined-contribution plan is not guaranteed.

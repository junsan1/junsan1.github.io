# Durable Goods Orders

## Introduction

Durable Goods Orders is a key [economic indicator](../e/economic_indicator.md) used by financial analysts, traders, economists, and policymakers to gauge the health of the [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) sector and predict future economic activity. These orders represent new orders placed with domestic manufacturers for delivery of hard goods that are expected to last at least three years, such as machinery, vehicles, household appliances, and technology products.

The Durable Goods Orders report is released monthly by the U.S. Census Bureau, and it provides valuable insights into the state of the [economy](../e/economy.md) by showing the level of current and future production activity. This [indicator](../i/indicator.md) can influence various markets, including the [stock market](../s/stock_market.md), [foreign exchange](../f/foreign_exchange.md) markets, and the [bond market](../b/bond_market.md), making it a critical data point for algrorading (short for [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md)) strategies.

## Definition of Durable Goods

Durable goods are items with a long useful [life expectancy](../l/life_expectancy.md), typically more than three years. These goods are designed to withstand wear, decay, and deterioration, thus providing [utility](../u/utility.md) and functionality over an extended period. The main categories of durable goods include:

1. **Automobiles and Transportation Equipment**: Cars, trucks, aircraft, ships, and railcars.
2. **Machinery and Industrial Equipment**: Factory machines, construction equipment, and agricultural machinery.
3. **Computers and Electronics**: PCs, servers, [networking](../n/networking.md) equipment, and consumer electronics.
4. **Appliances**: Refrigerators, ovens, washing machines, and air conditioning units.
5. **Furniture and Fixtures**: [Home](../h/home.md) and office furniture.
6. **Consumer Durables**: Products like televisions, mobile phones, and gaming consoles.

These goods are often high-cost items that require significant investment, and their purchasing patterns can signal consumer confidence and [business](../b/business.md) investment trends.

## Components of the Durable Goods Orders Report

The Durable Goods Orders report is broken down into several components, each providing different insights:

1. **Total Orders**: The aggregate [value](../v/value.md) of all new orders placed.
2. **Ex-Transportation Orders**: This measures new orders excluding the often-volatile transportation category, such as aircraft and automobiles, to give a clearer view of the broader [market](../m/market.md) [trend](../t/trend.md).
3. **Core [Capital Goods](../c/capital_goods.md) Orders**: A subset of durable goods orders excluding defense and aircraft, providing an [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of [business](../b/business.md) investment in equipment.
4. **Shipments**: Measures goods that have been shipped to customers.
5. **[Unfilled Orders](../u/unfilled_orders.md)**: Orders that have been placed but not yet fulfilled.
6. **Inventories**: The total [value](../v/value.md) of durable goods inventories.

Each of these components provides different angles of economic health and [business](../b/business.md) activity.

## Importance in Economic Analysis

Durable Goods Orders are critical for several reasons:

1. **[Economic Growth](../e/economic_growth.md) [Indicator](../i/indicator.md)**: An increase in orders suggests growing [demand](../d/demand.md) and confidence in the [economy](../e/economy.md), while a decrease might indicate a slowing [economy](../e/economy.md).
2. **[Business](../b/business.md) Investment Gauge**: Core [capital goods](../c/capital_goods.md) orders are closely watched as a sign of [business](../b/business.md) investment plans and future economic activity.
3. **GDP [Forecasting](../f/forecasting.md)**: Durable goods orders directly impact the [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) sector's contribution to Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
4. **[Market Sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md)**: Stock and [bond](../b/bond.md) markets react to the report, influencing [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) and investment decisions.

3. **[Mean Reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md)**: Betting on the tendency of durable goods orders to revert to historical average levels after extreme changes.
4. **Pair Trading**: Trading on the relative performance of [stocks](../s/stock.md) within the durable goods sector, such as comparing companies like Boeing and Caterpillar.

### Data Sources and Platforms

Several data providers and platforms allow traders to access Durable Goods Orders data for [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md):

### Case Studies

**Case Study 1: Impact on [Stock Market](../s/stock_market.md)**

An unexpected increase in durable goods orders can lead to a surge in stock prices for companies within the [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) and technology sectors. For example, if the report shows higher-than-expected orders for aircraft, [stocks](../s/stock.md) like Boeing (NYSE: BA) may experience a significant price increase.

**Case Study 2: Forex [Market](../m/market.md) Reaction**

Durable goods orders also influence forex markets. A stronger-than-expected report can lead to a surge in the U.S. dollar as it signals a [robust](../r/robust.md) [economy](../e/economy.md). Algo traders might exploit this by executing trades based on the dollar's movement against other currencies, such as the EUR/USD pair.

# Derivative Strategies

Derivative strategies are an integral part of modern finance and [quantitative trading](../q/quantitative_trading.md), providing investors and traders with tools to manage risk, leverage positions, and enhance returns. [Derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) are financial contracts whose value is derived from the performance of underlying assets, indices, interest rates, or currencies. The main types of derivative instruments include options, futures, forwards, and swaps. This article explores various derivative strategies in detail, focusing on their applications, advantages, disadvantages, and execution.

## Options Strategies

Options are a versatile class of [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) that provide the holder with the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price within a specified period.

### Covered Call

A covered call involves owning the underlying asset and selling a call option on the same asset. This strategy generates income from the option premium while providing some downside protection through the ownership of the asset.

#### Mechanics
1. Purchase shares of the underlying asset.
2. Sell call options for those shares.

#### Advantages
- Generates extra income from the premiums.
- Provides limited downside protection.

#### Disadvantages
- Limits the upside potential if the asset's price increases significantly.
- Still exposes the investor to the downside risk of the underlying asset.

### Protective Put

A protective put involves holding a long position in an asset and buying a put option on the same asset. This strategy acts as an insurance policy against a decline in the asset's price.

#### Mechanics
1. Purchase shares of the underlying asset.
2. Buy [put options](../p/put_options.md) for those shares.

#### Advantages
- Provides downside protection.
- Retains upside potential.

#### Disadvantages
- Cost of purchasing [put options](../p/put_options.md).

### Spread Strategies

Spreads involve taking positions in multiple options of the same class (calls or puts) on the same underlying asset but with different strike prices or expiration dates.

#### Bull Call Spread

A [bull call spread](../b/bull_call_spread.md) is used when a moderate rise in the price of the underlying asset is expected. It involves buying a call option at a lower strike price and selling another call option at a higher strike price.

#### Mechanics
1. Buy a call option at a lower strike price.
2. Sell a call option at a higher strike price.

#### Advantages
- Reduces the cost of the long call option.
- Limits potential loss.

#### Disadvantages
- Caps potential profit.

#### Bear Put Spread

A [bear put spread](../b/bear_put_spread.md) is used when a moderate decline in the price of the underlying asset is expected. It involves buying a put option at a higher strike price and selling another put option at a lower strike price.

#### Mechanics
1. Buy a put option at a higher strike price.
2. Sell a put option at a lower strike price.

#### Advantages
- Reduces the cost of the long put option.
- Limits potential loss.

#### Disadvantages
- Caps potential profit.

### Straddle

A straddle involves buying both a call option and a put option with the same strike price and expiration date. This strategy is used when a significant price movement in the underlying asset is expected, but the direction is uncertain.

#### Mechanics
1. Buy a call option at a certain strike price.
2. Buy a put option at the same strike price.

#### Advantages
- Profits from significant price movements in either direction.

#### Disadvantages
- High cost of purchasing both options.
- Potentially significant time decay if the asset price remains stable.

### Strangle

A strangle is similar to a straddle, but the call and [put options](../p/put_options.md) have different strike prices. The call option typically has a higher strike price than the put option. This strategy is used to profit from significant price movements in the underlying asset.

#### Mechanics
1. Buy a call option at a higher strike price.
2. Buy a put option at a lower strike price.

#### Advantages
- Lower cost compared to a straddle.
- Profits from significant price movements in either direction.

#### Disadvantages
- Wider range required for profitability.
- Potentially significant time decay if the asset price remains stable.

## Futures Strategies

[Futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) are standardized agreements to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price and date in the future. They are commonly used for hedging and speculative purposes.

### Long Futures

Long futures involve buying a futures contract to profit from an anticipated rise in the price of the underlying asset.

#### Mechanics
1. Buy a futures contract.

#### Advantages
- Provides leverage.
- Potential for significant profits if the price rises.

#### Disadvantages
- High risk if the price falls.

### Short Futures

Short futures involve selling a futures contract to profit from an anticipated decline in the price of the underlying asset.

#### Mechanics
1. Sell a futures contract.

#### Advantages
- Provides leverage.
- Potential for significant profits if the price falls.

#### Disadvantages
- High risk if the price rises.

### Calendar Spread

A calendar spread involves taking positions in [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) with different expiration dates on the same underlying asset. This strategy aims to profit from changes in the price difference between the two contracts.

#### Mechanics
1. Buy a futures contract with a longer expiration date.
2. Sell a futures contract with a shorter expiration date.

#### Advantages
- Benefits from time decay.
- Lower risk compared to outright long or short positions.

#### Disadvantages
- Limited profit potential.
- Complexity in execution.

## Swaps Strategies

Swaps are financial agreements in which two parties exchange cash flows or other financial instruments. They are used for managing interest rate risk, currency risk, and credit risk.

### Interest Rate Swap

An interest rate swap involves exchanging fixed-rate interest payments for floating-rate interest payments, or vice versa. This strategy is used to manage interest rate exposure.

#### Mechanics
1. Agree on terms with a counterparty.
2. Exchange interest payments based on the agreed terms.

#### Advantages
- Tailored to specific needs.
- Can reduce interest rate risk.

#### Disadvantages
- [Counterparty risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md).
- Potential complexity in valuation and management.

### Currency Swap

A currency swap involves exchanging principal and interest payments in different currencies. This strategy is used to manage currency risk in international operations.

#### Mechanics
1. Agree on terms with a counterparty.
2. Exchange principal and interest payments in different currencies.

#### Advantages
- Reduces currency risk.
- Facilitates international financing.

#### Disadvantages
- [Counterparty risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md).
- Potential complexity in execution and management.

### Credit Default Swap (CDS)

A credit default swap is a contract that provides protection against the default of a particular debt instrument. This strategy is used for managing credit risk.

#### Mechanics
1. Buy a CDS contract to protect against default risk.
2. Pay periodic premiums to the seller of the CDS.

#### Advantages
- Provides credit risk protection.
- Can be used for speculative purposes.

#### Disadvantages
- [Counterparty risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md).
- Potentially high costs.

## Implementation and Risk Management

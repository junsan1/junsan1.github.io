# Discrete Distribution

Discrete distributions play a pivotal role in probabilistic modeling and analysis, particularly in the field of algorithmic trading. These distributions describe scenarios where certain outcomes are distinct and countable, as opposed to continuous distributions that define a range of possible outcomes. Traders and quants use discrete distributions to model, analyze, and predict the behavior of discrete events in financial markets, optimizing their algorithms and strategies for better performance and minimized risk.

## Introduction to Discrete Distributions

In statistical terms, a distribution is a function that shows the possible values for a variable and how often they occur. A discrete distribution, specifically, maps out the probability of occurrence of each distinct and separate value of a random variable. The essential characteristic of a discrete random variable is that its possible values are countable, and every value has a non-zero probability of occurrence.

**Key Characteristics:**
1. **Countability**: The set of possible outcomes is discrete (e.g., number of trades executed, stock price changes in one-cent increments).
2. **Probability Mass Function (PMF)**: For discrete distributions, the PMF assigns a probability to each possible outcome in the sample space. The sum of these probabilities equals one.
3. **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)**: The CDF gives the probability that the random variable is less than or equal to a certain value.

## Common Types of Discrete Distributions

A few types of discrete distributions are frequently used in algorithmic trading:

### 1. **Binomial Distribution**

This distribution describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials, with a constant probability of success on each trial.

- **PMF**: The probability of having exactly k successes in n trials is given by:
  \[
  P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
  \]
  where \(\binom{n}{k}\) is the binomial coefficient, \(p\) is the probability of success, and \(n\) is the number of trials.

- **Example**: Modeling the number of days a stock price closes above a certain value in a given month.

### 2. **Poisson Distribution**

Used to model the number of times an event happens within a fixed interval of time or space, given the events occur at a constant rate and independently of the time since the last event.

- **PMF**: 
  \[
  P(X = k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}
  \]
  where \(\lambda\) is the average rate (mean number of events in an interval), and \(k\) is the number of occurrences.
  
- **Example**: The number of market orders placed by traders in an hour.

### 3. **Geometric Distribution**

This distribution models the number of trials needed to get the first success in a series of Bernoulli trials.

- **PMF**: 
  \[
  P(X = k) = (1-p)^{k-1} p
  \]
  where \(p\) is the probability of success and \(k\) is the trial on which the first success occurs.

- **Example**: The number of trades required before achieving a successful arbitrage.

### 4. **Negative Binomial Distribution**

Similar to the geometric distribution but counts the number of trials required to achieve a fixed number of successes.

- **PMF**:
  \[
  P(X = k) = \binom{k-1}{r-1} p^r (1-p)^{k-r}
  \]
  where \(\binom{k-1}{r-1}\) is the binomial coefficient, \(p\) is the probability of success, \(r\) is the number of successes, and \(k\) is the trial number on which the r-th success occurs.

- **Example**: The number of trades needed to realize a certain number of profitable trades.

### 5. **Hypergeometric Distribution**

Models the number of successes in a sample of size \(n\), drawn without replacement from a population of size \(N\) containing \(K\) successes.

- **PMF**:
  \[
  P(X = k) = \frac{\binom{K}{k} \binom{N-K}{n-k}}{\binom{N}{n}}
  \]
  where \(\binom{a}{b}\) is the binomial coefficient.

- **Example**: The number of winning stocks chosen in a sample from a larger population.

## Application in Algorithmic Trading

### 1. **Risk Management and Prediction**

Traders use discrete distributions to model risk, predict future events, and formulate trading strategies. For example:

- **Binomial Models**: Predicting binary outcomes such as a stock reaching a certain price (hit or miss) over a series of days.
- **Poisson Models**: Estimating the frequency of order arrivals in high-frequency trading.

### 2. **Order Book Analysis**

Algorithmic trading often involves analyzing order book data to anticipate market movements. Discrete distributions can help model the number of buy/sell orders or trade executions.

### 3. **Backtesting Trading Strategies**

Strategies can be backtested by simulating discrete events—like the occurrences of certain price movements—using appropriate discrete distributions. This allows for a better understanding of strategy performance under various scenarios.

### 4. **Option Pricing Models**

Discrete distributions assist in modeling the underlying assets whose price movements are discrete, helping in pricing complex derivatives and options accurately.

### 5. **Market Microstructure Analysis**

Poisson and other discrete modeling techniques are crucial for studying the microstructure of financial markets, helping understand the dynamics between orders, price formation, and liquidity.

## Companies Utilizing Discrete Distributions in Algorithmic Trading

Numerous financial firms and organizations leverage statistical models, including discrete distributions, to enhance their trading strategies. Some notable companies include:

- **Kershner Trading Group** (https://kershnertrading.com/): Employs sophisticated algorithms and probabilistic models to improve trading decisions.
- **Jane Street** (https://www.janestreet.com/): A leading proprietary trading firm that extensively uses quantitative financial modeling.
- **Two Sigma** (https://www.twosigma.com/): Known for utilizing advanced computational techniques and statistical models in their trading operations.

## Advanced Topics in Discrete Distributions

### 1. **Mixture Models**

Mixture models combine multiple probability distributions to cater to more complex trading phenomena which might not be accurately represented by a single discrete distribution.

### 2. **Hidden Markov Models (HMM)**

HMMs are useful for capturing sequences of observable events generated by underlying unobservable states, crucial in modeling time-series data in trading.

### 3. **Bayesian Inference**

Bayesian methods allow updating the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence becomes available. This is essential in updating trading strategies or predicting market shifts.

### 4. **Machine Learning Integration**

Discrete distributions are integrated with machine learning models to enhance predictive performance. Classification algorithms, for example, may utilize these distributions to forecast trade outcomes or market dynamics.

## Conclusion

Discrete distributions are fundamental in modelling and analyzing the discrete events that underlie complex financial markets. These statistical tools equip traders and analysts with deeper insights and predictive power, enhancing trading strategies and risk management practices. Whether used in simple models like the binomial or Poisson distributions or in more complex frameworks like HMMs and Bayesian methods, discrete distributions provide the backbone for some of the most advanced techniques in algorithmic trading today.

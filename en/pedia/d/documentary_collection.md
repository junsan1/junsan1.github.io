# Documentary Collection

## Introduction to Documentary Collection

In the realm of international [trade finance](../t/trade_finance.md), a Documentary Collection (DC) is a [transaction](../t/transaction.md) where banks act as intermediaries to [handle](../h/handle.md) the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) of shipping and financial documents between a buyer and a seller. This mechanism provides a way to manage the risks associated with international [trade](../t/trade.md), ensuring that the buyer receives the goods and the seller receives [payment](../p/payment.md) under agreed terms. It can be considered a compromise between the [open](../o/open.md) account [transaction](../t/transaction.md), which is high-[risk](../r/risk.md) for exporters, and the [letter of credit](../l/letter_of_credit.md), which can be burdensome and costly for both parties.

## Key Types of Documentary Collection

### Documents Against Payment (D/P)
In a D/P collection, the shipment documents are only released to the importer once [payment](../p/payment.md) has been made. This method ensures the exporter retains control over the goods until [payment](../p/payment.md) has been confirmed. The financial institution handles the documents, only releasing them once they've received the specified [payment](../p/payment.md).

### Documents Against Acceptance (D/A)
In a D/A collection, the shipment documents are released to the importer once they accept a [bill of exchange](../b/bill_of_exchange.md) or draft, promising to pay at a future date. This method entails more [risk](../r/risk.md) for the exporter as the goods are released before actual [payment](../p/payment.md) is made, relying instead on the importer’s promise to pay.

## Process of Documentary Collection

### Step-by-Step Procedure

1. **Sales Agreement:** The buyer and seller agree on the [sale](../s/sale.md) terms and decide to use a documentary collection as a [payment](../p/payment.md) method.
2. **Shipment of Goods:** The seller ships the goods and collects the shipping documents.
3. **Submission to Remitting [Bank](../b/bank.md):** The seller submits the shipping documents to their [bank](../b/bank.md) (the remitting [bank](../b/bank.md)) with collection instructions.
4. **Forwarding to Collecting [Bank](../b/bank.md):** The remitting [bank](../b/bank.md) sends the documents to the buyer’s [bank](../b/bank.md) (the collecting [bank](../b/bank.md)).
5. **Notification to Buyer:** The collecting [bank](../b/bank.md) notifies the buyer of the document arrival.
6. **Document Release:** The documents are released to the buyer either upon [payment](../p/payment.md) (D/P) or acceptance of the draft (D/A).
7. **[Payment](../p/payment.md) Transfer:** For D/P, once [payment](../p/payment.md) is received, the remitting [bank](../b/bank.md) transfers the funds to the seller. For D/A, the [payment](../p/payment.md) is made by the buyer on the [maturity date](../m/maturity_date.md), as per the draft terms.

### Parties Involved

1. **[Principal](../p/principal.md) (Exporter):** The seller of the goods.
2. **Drawee (Importer):** The buyer of the goods.
3. **Remitting [Bank](../b/bank.md):** The exporter's [bank](../b/bank.md) that forwards the documents.
4. **Collecting [Bank](../b/bank.md):** The importer's [bank](../b/bank.md) that handles the collection process and release of documents.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

- **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Mitigation for Exporters:** Provides a level of [assurance](../a/assurance.md) that the buyer’s [bank](../b/bank.md) [will](../w/will.md) [handle](../h/handle.md) the [transaction](../t/transaction.md), reducing the [risk](../r/risk.md) of non-[payment](../p/payment.md).
- **Simplicity and Cost-Effectiveness:** The process is simpler and less costly compared to letters of [credit](../c/credit.md).
- **Flexibility:** DCs [offer](../o/offer.md) flexibility in terms of [payment](../p/payment.md), allowing for immediate payments (D/P) or deferred payments (D/A).

### Disadvantages

- **[Risk](../r/risk.md) for Exporters in D/A Transactions:** The exporter still faces the [risk](../r/risk.md) of non-[payment](../p/payment.md) as the goods are released before actual [payment](../p/payment.md).
- **Lack of Comprehensive Guarantee:** Unlike letters of [credit](../c/credit.md), DCs do not provide a [payment](../p/payment.md) guarantee, just an [assurance](../a/assurance.md) of document handling.
- **Extended [Payment](../p/payment.md) Cycle:** In D/A transactions, the [payment](../p/payment.md) cycle can be extended, impacting the exporter’s [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md).

## Practical Examples and Case Studies

### Example 1: Machinery Export from Germany to Brazil

A German exporter ship machinery to a Brazilian importer. They agree on a D/P collection term. The German company's [bank](../b/bank.md) (remitting [bank](../b/bank.md)) sends shipping documents to the Brazilian [bank](../b/bank.md) (collecting [bank](../b/bank.md)), specifying that the documents should only be released against [payment](../p/payment.md). The Brazilian importer makes the [payment](../p/payment.md), receives the documents, and clears the machinery from customs.

### Example 2: Textile Export from India to the USA

An Indian textile exporter sells goods to a US buyer under D/A collection terms. The Indian [bank](../b/bank.md) sends the documents to the US [bank](../b/bank.md), which releases them against the buyer's acceptance of a draft payable in 60 days. The Indian exporter sends the goods, the buyer accepts the draft, receives the documents, and makes [payment](../p/payment.md) on the [maturity date](../m/maturity_date.md).

## Legal and Regulatory Framework

Documentary collections are governed primarily by the Uniform Rules for Collections (URC 522), issued by the International Chamber of [Commerce](../c/commerce.md) (ICC). 

### URC 522 Main Provisions

1. **Definitions:** Defines terms like presenting [bank](../b/bank.md), presenting party, and collection instruction to ensure clarity.
2. **Documents Handling:** Guidelines on how banks should [handle](../h/handle.md) documents, including presentation, checking, and release.
3. **[Bank](../b/bank.md) Responsibilities:** Stipulates the responsibilities and liabilities of banks involved in the collection process.
4. **[Reimbursement](../r/reimbursement.md) and Charges:** Rules concerning charges applied by banks handling collections and [reimbursement](../r/reimbursement.md) procedures.

Compliance to these rules ensures a streamlined and [neutral](../n/neutral.md) framework accepted internationally, reducing legal risks and disputes.

## Conclusion

Documentary collections [offer](../o/offer.md) a balanced approach to international [trade finance](../t/trade_finance.md), combining sender control over goods with relatively low costs and simplicity. While less secure than letters of [credit](../c/credit.md), they present fewer complexities and [offer](../o/offer.md) flexibility beneficial to both exporters and importers. Understanding the terms, process, and risks associated with DCs is crucial for businesses engaged in global [trade](../t/trade.md).

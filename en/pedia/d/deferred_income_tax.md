# Deferred Income Tax

Deferred [income tax](../i/income_tax.md), also known as [deferred tax liability](../d/deferred_tax_liability.md) or [asset](../a/asset.md), is a financial concept that represents a difference between a company's [accounting](../a/accounting.md) [income](../i/income.md) and [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md). It arises due to the timing differences between when [income](../i/income.md) and expenses are recognized under Generally Accepted [Accounting Principles](../a/accounting_principles.md) (GAAP) or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) versus when they are recognized for tax purposes. This complex concept plays a crucial role in [financial accounting](../f/financial_accounting.md) and [taxation](../t/taxation.md), impacting both the [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) and [tax planning](../t/tax_planning.md) strategies of businesses.

## Definition

### Deferred Tax Liability
A [deferred tax liability](../d/deferred_tax_liability.md) (DTL) is an obligation to pay [taxes](../t/taxes.md) in the future due to temporary differences between the company's internal [accounting](../a/accounting.md) and tax reporting. Specifically, it arises when a company reports more [income](../i/income.md) on its [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) than it does on its tax returns due to different timing rules.

### Deferred Tax Asset
Conversely, a [deferred tax asset](../d/deferred_tax_asset.md) (DTA) occurs when a company has paid too much in [taxes](../t/taxes.md) or has incurred losses that can be used to reduce future [taxes](../t/taxes.md). It emerges from the recognition of losses and credits that [will](../w/will.md) be settled against tax liabilities in the future.

## Purpose

The primary purposes of deferred [income tax](../i/income_tax.md) include:

1. **Accurate Financial Reporting**: It ensures that the [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) give a true and fair view of a company's financial position.
2. **Timing Differences Management**: It reconciles the variations between tax legislation and [accounting](../a/accounting.md) standards concerning [income](../i/income.md) recognition.
3. **[Tax Planning](../t/tax_planning.md)**: Helps in planning for future tax payments or benefits.
4. **[Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md) Management**: By recognizing deferred [taxes](../t/taxes.md), companies can plan their cash requirements for future tax payments better.
5. **Compliance with [Accounting](../a/accounting.md) Standards**: It is essential for compliance with GAAP and IFRS, which require the recognition of [taxes](../t/taxes.md) in the period to which they pertain, not when they are paid or received.

## Causes of Deferred Income Tax

Several factors can lead to the creation of deferred [income tax](../i/income_tax.md), including:

1. **[Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) Methods**: Different [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) methods (straight-line vs. accelerated) can create timing differences.
2. **[Revenue Recognition](../r/revenue_recognition.md)**: Differences in how [revenue](../r/revenue.md) is recognized can result in deferred tax.
3. **[Expense](../e/expense.md) Recognition**: Differences in [expense](../e/expense.md) recognition timing for [accounting](../a/accounting.md) and tax purposes, such as [warranty](../w/warranty.md) expenses or [bad debt](../b/bad_debt.md) provisions.
4. **Tax Loss Carryforwards**: Losses from previous years can be used to [offset](../o/offset.md) future profits.
5. **Investment Gains and Losses**: Timing differences in the recognition of gains and losses on investments.

## Examples

### Example of Deferred Tax Liability
A company buys a piece of equipment for $100,000. For financial reporting, it uses a straight-line [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) method over 10 years. For tax purposes, it uses an [accelerated depreciation](../a/accelerated_depreciation.md) method, which allows it to depreciate the [asset](../a/asset.md) faster. 

In Year 1, the financial [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) [expense](../e/expense.md) is $10,000, while the tax [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) [expense](../e/expense.md) is $20,000. The company reports higher [income](../i/income.md) in its financial statement than on its [tax return](../t/tax_return.md), creating a [deferred tax liability](../d/deferred_tax_liability.md).

### Example of Deferred Tax Asset
A company incurs a $50,000 loss in Year 1, which it can't fully utilize for tax purposes in that year. This loss can be carried forward to [offset](../o/offset.md) [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md) in future years. The company records a [deferred tax asset](../d/deferred_tax_asset.md), reflecting the [tax benefit](../t/tax_benefit.md) it expects to receive.

## Recognition and Measurement

### Initial Recognition

1. **DTL**: When [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md) is less than [accounting](../a/accounting.md) [income](../i/income.md) due to temporary differences, a [deferred tax liability](../d/deferred_tax_liability.md) is recognized.
2. **DTA**: When [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md) is more than [accounting](../a/accounting.md) [income](../i/income.md) due to temporary differences, a [deferred tax asset](../d/deferred_tax_asset.md) is recognized.

### Measurement

Deferred tax assets and liabilities must be measured at the tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the [asset](../a/asset.md) is realized or the [liability](../l/liability.md) is settled, based on tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) date.

### Valuation Allowance

A [valuation](../v/valuation.md) allowance is required if it is more likely than not that some or all of the [deferred tax asset](../d/deferred_tax_asset.md) [will](../w/will.md) not be realized. The allowance reduces the carrying amount of the [deferred tax asset](../d/deferred_tax_asset.md) to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.

## Impact on Financial Statements

### Income Statement
Deferred tax expenses or benefits are reported on the [income statement](../i/income_statement.md). This includes the tax effect of current and deferred tax expenses or benefits arising from temporary differences.

### Balance Sheet
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are reported on the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) under non-[current liabilities](../c/current_liabilities.md) and non-[current assets](../c/current_assets.md), respectively. They should be netted off if:

1. The entity has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities.
2. The deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to [taxes](../t/taxes.md) levied by the same [taxation](../t/taxation.md) authority on the same taxable entity.

### Statement of Cash Flows
Deferred [taxes](../t/taxes.md) often impact [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) statements indirectly through adjustments made to net [income](../i/income.md) or loss within the [operating activities](../o/operating_activities.md) section.

## Real-world Application

### Large Corporations

Large corporations often have significant deferred tax liabilities and assets due to the complexity and scale of their operations. These companies utilize sophisticated [tax planning](../t/tax_planning.md) strategies and [in-house](../i/in-house.md) or external tax experts to manage deferred [taxes](../t/taxes.md) effectively. Companies like General Electric (GE) and Microsoft have [robust](../r/robust.md) deferred [tax accounting](../t/tax_accounting.md) practices. For instance, GE's financial services division frequently deals with complex leases and financial instruments that create deferred tax items.

### Financial Institutions

Banks and financial institutions also deal extensively with deferred [taxes](../t/taxes.md), as their financial instruments and [loan](../l/loan.md) portfolios often result in timing differences. Citibank, for example, must carefully manage its deferred tax positions to ensure regulatory compliance and optimize tax liabilities.

### Technology Companies

Technology companies such as Google and Amazon, which often invest heavily in research and development, may have substantial deferred tax assets due to tax credits and capitalized expenses that differ between [accounting](../a/accounting.md) and tax treatments.

## Conclusion

Deferred [income tax](../i/income_tax.md) is a vital concept in [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md) and [accounting](../a/accounting.md). It ensures that [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) accurately reflect a companyâ€™s financial position by [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for timing differences between recognized [income](../i/income.md) and [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md). While it can be complex, understanding deferred [taxes](../t/taxes.md) is essential for strategic [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md) and compliance with [accounting](../a/accounting.md) standards.

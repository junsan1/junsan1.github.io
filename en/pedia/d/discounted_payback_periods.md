# Discounted Payback Period

The Discounted [Payback Period](../p/payback_period.md) (DPP) is a financial metric used to evaluate the [risk](../r/risk.md) and profitability of an investment project. While the traditional [payback period](../p/payback_period.md) simply measures the time required for an investment to generate an amount of [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) sufficient to recover the initial investment, the DPP refines this by considering the [time value](../t/time_value.md) of [money](../m/money.md) (TVM). In essence, the DPP calculates the time required to break even in Net [Present Value](../p/present_value.md) (NPV) terms.

## Definition and Formula 

The Discounted [Payback Period](../p/payback_period.md) is the time it takes for the discounted cash flows of a project to cover the initial investment cost. Unlike the simple [payback period](../p/payback_period.md), which ignores the timing and [risk](../r/risk.md) of cash flows, the DPP discounts the cash flows at a specific [discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md), usually aligned with the company's [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md).

### Formula

The general formula for the DPP is given as:

\[ \text{DPP} = \min \left\{ t \mid \sum_{i=1}^{t} \frac{CF_i}{(1 + r)^i} \geq I \right\} \]

Where:

- \( CF_i \) = [Cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) at the end of period \( i \)
- \( r \) = [Discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md)
- \( I \) = Initial investment
- \( t \) = Time periods (years, months, etc.)

### Steps to Calculate 

1. **Identify the Initial Investment**: Determine the initial outlay for the project.
2. **Choose the Appropriate [Discount Rate](../d/discount_rate.md)**: Typically, the company’s [Weighted Average](../w/weighted_average.md) [Cost of Capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md) (WACC) is used as the [discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md).
3. **Forecast the Future Cash Flows**: Estimate the cash flows that the project is expected to generate over its lifetime.
4. **Calculate the [Present Value](../p/present_value.md) of Each [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md)**: Use the [discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md) to calculate the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of each [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md).
5. **Accumulate the Discounted Cash Flows**: Sum the present values of the cash flows until they equal or exceed the initial investment. The period in which this occurs is the DPP.

### Example Calculation

Assume a project requires an initial investment of $10,000 and expects to generate cash flows of $4,000, $3,000, $2,000, and $2,000 over four years. The [discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md) is 10%.

1. **Year 1**: PV of $4,000 = \( \frac{4000}{(1+0.1)^1} = \$3,636 \)
2. **Year 2**: PV of $3,000 = \( \frac{3000}{(1+0.1)^2} = \$2,479 \)
3. **Year 3**: PV of $2,000 = \( \frac{2000}{(1+0.1)^3} = \$1,502 \)
4. **Year 4**: PV of $2,000 = \( \frac{2000}{(1+0.1)^4} = \$1,366 \)

Cumulatively:

- After Year 1: \$3,636
- After Year 2: \$6,115
- After Year 3: \$7,617
- After Year 4: \$8,983

Since the cumulative discounted [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) of $8,983 by the end of Year 4 does not recover the initial investment of $10,000, the project's DPP exceeds 4 years — it means that the project does not pay back within 4 years when considering the [time value](../t/time_value.md) of [money](../m/money.md).

## Advantages of DPP

1. **Accounts for [Time Value](../t/time_value.md) of [Money](../m/money.md)**: By [discounting](../d/discounting.md) future cash flows, DPP provides a more accurate measure of the project's [value](../v/value.md) and [risk](../r/risk.md).
2. **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Assessment**: Projects with shorter DPPs are often considered less risky since they recoup the investment more quickly.
3. **Focus on [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md) Timings**: Helps investors and managers to understand the timing of cash inflows.

## Disadvantages of DPP

1. **Ignores Profitability Beyond Payback**: DPP does not consider cash flows that occur after the [payback period](../p/payback_period.md). Thus, it may undervalue highly [lucrative](../l/lucrative.md) projects with longer horizons.
2. **Complexity**: The calculation is more complex than the simple [payback period](../p/payback_period.md), requiring estimation of a [discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md) and accurate [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) forecasts.
3. **Subjectivity in [Discount Rate](../d/discount_rate.md)**: The choice of [discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md) can significantly affect the DPP, making it somewhat subjective.

## Applications in Algorithmic Trading

In the realm of [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), the DPP can be used to ascertain the viability of [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), particularly those requiring substantial initial [capital](../c/capital.md) for technology, data [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md), and [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) development. 

### Case Study Example: Trading Algorithms

Imaginatively applying a DPP calculation to a [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) involves:

1. **Initial Investment**: High-frequency [trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md), costing $500,000.
2. **Estimated Returns**: The strategy is expected to generate annual profits of $150,000, $180,000, $210,000, and $250,000 over four years.
3. **[Discount Rate](../d/discount_rate.md)**: Assuming a 5% [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md).

The discounted cash flows over four years would be:

1. **Year 1**: \( PV = \frac{150,000}{(1+0.05)^1} = \$142,857 \)
2. **Year 2**: \( PV = \frac{180,000}{(1+0.05)^2} = \$163,265 \)
3. **Year 3**: \( PV = \frac{210,000}{(1+0.05)^3} = \$181,405 \)
4. **Year 4**: \( PV = \frac{250,000}{(1+0.05)^4} = \$205,386 \)

Cumulatively:

- After Year 1: \$142,857
- After Year 2: \$306,122
- After Year 3: \$487,527
- After Year 4: \$692,913

Since the cumulative discounted [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) of $692,913 by the end of Year 4 recovers the initial $500,000 investment, the DPP is less than four years. The exact DPP falls somewhere in the third year.

## Conclusion

The Discounted [Payback Period](../p/payback_period.md) is a refined financial metric that provides a more nuanced understanding of investment recovery time by incorporating the [time value](../t/time_value.md) of [money](../m/money.md). It's invaluable for understanding the [risk](../r/risk.md) and timing of cash inflows, especially in industries and settings where [capital](../c/capital.md) costs are high, and future cash flows are uncertain. However, it should be used in conjunction with other financial metrics to get a holistic view of an investment’s profitability and [risk](../r/risk.md) profile. In the world of [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), the DPP can help assess the financial viability of extensive investments in trading technology and strategy development.

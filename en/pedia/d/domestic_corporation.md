# Domestic Corporation

A domestic corporation is a business entity that is incorporated and does business in its country of origin. For example, a company incorporated in the United States that operates within the U.S. is considered a domestic corporation in relation to U.S. jurisdictions.

## Key Characteristics of Domestic Corporations

### 1. **Incorporation**
A domestic corporation is formed by filing articles of incorporation with the relevant state authority, often the Secretary of State. The articles include essential information such as the corporation's name, purpose, number of authorized shares, and details of the incorporators. 

### 2. **Jurisdiction**
The primary distinguishing factor of a domestic corporation is that it operates within the confines of the legal jurisdiction where it was incorporated. This grants it certain protections and responsibilities under local law.

### 3. **Legal Benefits and Obligations**
Domestic corporations enjoy specific legal advantages, including limited liability protection for shareholders, the ability to raise capital through stock, and perpetual existence. Conversely, they must adhere to regulatory requirements, tax obligations, and compliance measures of the state.

### 4. **Taxation**
Domestic corporations are subject to corporate taxes in their home state. This includes federal corporate income taxes and possibly state-level taxes. They must file tax returns and pay taxes based on their net income.

### 5. **Corporate Governance**
These corporations must establish a formal corporate structure, including a board of directors and officers, and adopt bylaws to govern their operations. Regular meetings, record-keeping, and adherence to corporate formalities are mandatory.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages:
- **Limited Liability**: Shareholders are not personally liable for the corporation’s debts and liabilities.
- **Capital Raising**: Can issue shares to raise capital.
- **Perpetual Existence**: Continued existence regardless of changes in ownership.

### Disadvantages:
- **Double Taxation**: Income taxed at both corporate and individual shareholder levels.
- **Complex Management**: Requires adherence to strict regulatory and administrative requirements.
- **Formation Costs**: Higher initial costs compared to sole proprietorships or partnerships.

## Domestic Corporation vs. Foreign Corporation

A domestic corporation differs from a foreign corporation, which is incorporated in one jurisdiction (state or country) but operates in another. For example, a company incorporated in Delaware but operating in California would be considered a foreign corporation in California.

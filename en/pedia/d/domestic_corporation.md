# Domestic Corporation

A domestic [corporation](../c/corporation.md) is a [business](../b/business.md) entity that is incorporated and does [business](../b/business.md) in its country of origin. For example, a company incorporated in the United States that operates within the U.S. is considered a domestic [corporation](../c/corporation.md) in relation to U.S. jurisdictions.

## Key Characteristics of Domestic Corporations

### 1. **Incorporation**
A domestic [corporation](../c/corporation.md) is formed by filing articles of [incorporation](../i/incorporation.md) with the relevant state authority, often the Secretary of State. The articles include essential information such as the [corporation](../c/corporation.md)'s name, purpose, number of authorized [shares](../s/shares.md), and details of the incorporators. 

### 2. **Jurisdiction**
The primary distinguishing [factor](../f/factor.md) of a domestic [corporation](../c/corporation.md) is that it operates within the confines of the legal jurisdiction where it was incorporated. This grants it certain protections and responsibilities under local law.

### 3. **Legal Benefits and Obligations**
Domestic corporations enjoy specific legal advantages, including [limited liability](../l/limited_liability.md) protection for shareholders, the ability to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) through stock, and perpetual existence. Conversely, they must adhere to regulatory requirements, tax [obligations](../o/obligation.md), and compliance measures of the state.

### 4. **Taxation**
Domestic corporations are subject to corporate [taxes](../t/taxes.md) in their [home](../h/home.md) state. This includes federal corporate [income](../i/income.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) and possibly state-level [taxes](../t/taxes.md). They must file tax returns and pay [taxes](../t/taxes.md) based on their net [income](../i/income.md).

### 5. **Corporate Governance**
These corporations must establish a formal corporate structure, including a board of directors and officers, and adopt bylaws to govern their operations. Regular meetings, record-keeping, and adherence to corporate formalities are mandatory.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

- **Formation Costs**: Higher initial costs compared to sole proprietorships or partnerships.

## Domestic Corporation vs. Foreign Corporation

A domestic [corporation](../c/corporation.md) differs from a foreign [corporation](../c/corporation.md), which is incorporated in one jurisdiction (state or country) but operates in another.

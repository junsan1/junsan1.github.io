# Discretionary Trading

Discretionary trading is a type of [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) whereby buy and sell decisions are made by a human [trader](../t/trader.md), as opposed to being determined by a pre-defined algorithm. This approach relies heavily on the [trader](../t/trader.md)'s [judgment](../j/judgment.md), experience, and knowledge of the [market](../m/market.md) to make investment decisions. In this document, we [will](../w/will.md) explore the different aspects of discretionary trading, including its principles, techniques, psychological factors, advantages, challenges, and comparisons with [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md).

### Principles of Discretionary Trading

Discretionary trading involves a more subjective approach to the markets. The primary principle is that the [trader](../t/trader.md) uses their intuition and experience to interpret [market](../m/market.md) data and make trading decisions. Traders may use charts, [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md), news, economic data, and other sources of information to form a view on the direction of a particular [asset](../a/asset.md) or the [market](../m/market.md) as a whole.

- **[Market](../m/market.md) Analysis**: Discretionary traders often conduct thorough [market](../m/market.md) analysis to discern trends, patterns, and key levels. This can include both technical and [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md).
- **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Effective discretionary trading must involve a disciplined approach to [risk management](../r/risk_management.md). This includes setting [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md), [position sizing](../p/position_sizing.md), and [portfolio diversification](../p/portfolio_diversification.md).
- **Flexibility**: One of the key advantages of discretionary trading is its flexibility. Traders can quickly adapt to new [market](../m/market.md) conditions or information that may not be accounted for by a static algorithm.

### Techniques in Discretionary Trading

1. **[Technical Analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md)**: Discretionary traders frequently use [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) to identify trends, support/resistance levels, and potential entry or exit points. [Technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) such as moving averages, [relative strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [index](../i/index.md) (RSI), and MACD are commonly utilized.
2. **[Fundamental Analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md)**: In addition to [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md), some discretionary traders incorporate [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md). This might include evaluating [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md), company [earnings](../e/earnings.md) reports, and other [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md).
3. **News Trading**: Some traders focus on trading based on news releases and [market](../m/market.md)-moving events. These traders aim to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and rapid price movements resulting from significant news.
4. **[Sentiment Analysis](../s/sentiment_analysis.md)**: Discretionary traders might also analyze [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) to gauge the mood of other traders and investors. Tools for [sentiment analysis](../s/sentiment_analysis.md) can include [social media](../s/social_media.md) trends, news sentiment, and [market](../m/market.md) surveys.

### Psychological Factors

Discretionary trading is heavily dependent on the [trader](../t/trader.md)’s psychological state and emotional control. Key psychological factors include:

- **Discipline**: Consistency in following a trading plan and sticking to set rules without deviating due to emotional impulses.
- **Patience**: Waiting for the right [market](../m/market.md) conditions and setups as identified by their trading approach.
- **Emotional Control**: Managing emotions like fear, greed, and overconfidence. This is crucial as emotions can cloud [judgment](../j/judgment.md) and lead to poor decision-making.
- **Stress Management**: Trading, especially high-frequency trading, can be exceptionally stressful. Effective stress management techniques are vital for maintaining a clear and focused mind.

### Advantages of Discretionary Trading

1. **Adaptability**: Discretionary trading allows traders to quickly adapt to new information or changing [market](../m/market.md) conditions that may not be immediately recognized by an algorithm.
2. **Human Insight**: The human brain can process a vast array of information and spot nuances or patterns that may be overlooked by a predefined algorithm.
3. **Flexibility**: Traders can use a wide array of strategies and switch between them according to the [market](../m/market.md) environment.

### Challenges of Discretionary Trading

1. **Emotional Bias**: Discretionary trading is susceptible to emotional biases such as overconfidence, fear of loss, and attachment to specific trades.
2. **Consistency**: Maintaining consistent results can be challenging due to the variable nature of human [judgment](../j/judgment.md) and the complexity of markets.
3. **Time-Consuming**: Discretionary trading requires constant monitoring of the markets, which can be time-consuming and mentally exhausting.
4. **[Scalability](../s/scalability.md)**: It can be difficult to scale up [discretionary trading strategies](../d/discretionary_trading_strategies.md) because they depend heavily on the [trader](../t/trader.md)'s [judgment](../j/judgment.md) and decision-making process.

### Comparison with Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), or algo trading, uses computer algorithms to automatically execute trades based on pre-set criteria. Here is a comparison between discretionary trading and [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md):

#### Discretionary Trading

- **Flexibility**: High – Traders can adapt to new information and changing [market](../m/market.md) conditions quickly.
- **Emotional Influence**: High – Decisions can be influenced by the [trader](../t/trader.md)’s emotions and psychological state.
- **[Scalability](../s/scalability.md)**: Low – Difficult to scale as strategies are often based on individual [judgment](../j/judgment.md) and decision-making.
- **Consistency**: Variable – Results can vary based on the [trader](../t/trader.md)’s skill, discipline, and [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

#### Algorithmic Trading

- **Flexibility**: Low – Algorithms follow pre-set rules and may not adapt quickly to sudden [market](../m/market.md) changes.
- **Emotional Influence**: None – Decisions are made by the algorithm, removing emotional bias.
- **[Scalability](../s/scalability.md)**: High – Algorithms can easily be scaled up to [handle](../h/handle.md) large volumes of trades.
- **Consistency**: High – Can provide consistent results as long as the algorithm is [robust](../r/robust.md) and [market](../m/market.md) conditions are favorable.

### Conclusion

Discretionary trading remains a popular approach for many traders because of its adaptability and the [value](../v/value.md) of human insight. However, it requires a high level of discipline, emotional control, and a thorough understanding of [market](../m/market.md) mechanics. While it offers several advantages, it also presents significant challenges, especially when it comes to maintaining consistency and managing emotional biases.

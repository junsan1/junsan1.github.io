# Discretionary Trading

Discretionary trading is a type of trading strategy whereby buy and sell decisions are made by a human trader, as opposed to being determined by a pre-defined algorithm. This approach relies heavily on the trader's judgment, experience, and knowledge of the market to make investment decisions. In this document, we will explore the different aspects of discretionary trading, including its principles, techniques, psychological factors, advantages, challenges, and comparisons with algorithmic trading.

### Principles of Discretionary Trading

Discretionary trading involves a more subjective approach to the markets. The primary principle is that the trader uses their intuition and experience to interpret market data and make trading decisions. Traders may use charts, [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md), news, economic data, and other sources of information to form a view on the direction of a particular asset or the market as a whole.

- **Market Analysis**: Discretionary traders often conduct thorough market analysis to discern trends, patterns, and key levels. This can include both technical and [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md).
- **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Effective discretionary trading must involve a disciplined approach to [risk management](../r/risk_management.md). This includes setting [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md), [position sizing](../p/position_sizing.md), and [portfolio diversification](../p/portfolio_diversification.md).
- **Flexibility**: One of the key advantages of discretionary trading is its flexibility. Traders can quickly adapt to new market conditions or information that may not be accounted for by a static algorithm.

### Techniques in Discretionary Trading

1. **[Technical Analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md)**: Discretionary traders frequently use [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) to identify trends, support/resistance levels, and potential entry or exit points. [Technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) such as moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), and MACD are commonly utilized.
2. **[Fundamental Analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md)**: In addition to [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md), some discretionary traders incorporate [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md). This might include evaluating [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md), company earnings reports, and other financial statements.
3. **News Trading**: Some traders focus on trading based on news releases and market-moving events. These traders aim to capitalize on volatility and rapid price movements resulting from significant news.
4. **[Sentiment Analysis](../s/sentiment_analysis.md)**: Discretionary traders might also analyze market sentiment to gauge the mood of other traders and investors. Tools for [sentiment analysis](../s/sentiment_analysis.md) can include social media trends, news sentiment, and market surveys.

### Psychological Factors

Discretionary trading is heavily dependent on the trader’s psychological state and emotional control. Key psychological factors include:

- **Discipline**: Consistency in following a trading plan and sticking to set rules without deviating due to emotional impulses.
- **Patience**: Waiting for the right market conditions and setups as identified by their trading approach.
- **Emotional Control**: Managing emotions like fear, greed, and overconfidence. This is crucial as emotions can cloud judgment and lead to poor decision-making.
- **Stress Management**: Trading, especially high-frequency trading, can be exceptionally stressful. Effective stress management techniques are vital for maintaining a clear and focused mind.

### Advantages of Discretionary Trading

1. **Adaptability**: Discretionary trading allows traders to quickly adapt to new information or changing market conditions that may not be immediately recognized by an algorithm.
2. **Human Insight**: The human brain can process a vast array of information and spot nuances or patterns that may be overlooked by a predefined algorithm.
3. **Flexibility**: Traders can use a wide array of strategies and switch between them according to the market environment.

### Challenges of Discretionary Trading

1. **Emotional Bias**: Discretionary trading is susceptible to emotional biases such as overconfidence, fear of loss, and attachment to specific trades.
2. **Consistency**: Maintaining consistent results can be challenging due to the variable nature of human judgment and the complexity of markets.
3. **Time-Consuming**: Discretionary trading requires constant monitoring of the markets, which can be time-consuming and mentally exhausting.
4. **Scalability**: It can be difficult to scale up [discretionary trading strategies](../d/discretionary_trading_strategies.md) because they depend heavily on the trader's judgment and decision-making process.

### Comparison with Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), or algo trading, uses computer algorithms to automatically execute trades based on pre-set criteria. Here is a comparison between discretionary trading and [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md):

#### Discretionary Trading

- **Flexibility**: High – Traders can adapt to new information and changing market conditions quickly.
- **Emotional Influence**: High – Decisions can be influenced by the trader’s emotions and psychological state.
- **Scalability**: Low – Difficult to scale as strategies are often based on individual judgment and decision-making.
- **Consistency**: Variable – Results can vary based on the trader’s skill, discipline, and market conditions.

#### Algorithmic Trading

- **Flexibility**: Low – Algorithms follow pre-set rules and may not adapt quickly to sudden market changes.
- **Emotional Influence**: None – Decisions are made by the algorithm, removing emotional bias.
- **Scalability**: High – Algorithms can easily be scaled up to handle large volumes of trades.
- **Consistency**: High – Can provide consistent results as long as the algorithm is robust and market conditions are favorable.

### Conclusion

Discretionary trading remains a popular approach for many traders because of its adaptability and the value of human insight. However, it requires a high level of discipline, emotional control, and a thorough understanding of market mechanics. While it offers several advantages, it also presents significant challenges, especially when it comes to maintaining consistency and managing emotional biases.

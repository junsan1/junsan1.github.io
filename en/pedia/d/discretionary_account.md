# Discretionary Account

A discretionary account is a type of investment account that allows a [broker](../b/broker.md) or [financial advisor](../f/financial_advisor.md) to make decisions and transactions on behalf of the [investor](../i/investor.md) without requiring the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s direct approval for each [transaction](../t/transaction.md). This type of account can [offer](../o/offer.md) various advantages for investors, particularly those who lack the time, expertise, or desire to manage their investments actively. In this comprehensive overview, we [will](../w/will.md) explore the concept of discretionary accounts, how they work, their benefits and risks, the process of setting up such an account, and examples of companies that [offer](../o/offer.md) discretionary account services.

## How Discretionary Accounts Work

### Authorization and Control

When an [investor](../i/investor.md) sets up a discretionary account, they [grant](../g/grant.md) specific authorization to their [broker](../b/broker.md) or [financial advisor](../f/financial_advisor.md) to manage the account. This authorization is usually formalized through a [power of attorney](../p/power_of_attorney.md) document. The level of discretion can vary, but it typically includes decisions related to buying and selling securities, [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md), and [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md).

### Decision-Making Process

The [broker](../b/broker.md) or [financial advisor](../f/financial_advisor.md) uses their expertise and [judgment](../j/judgment.md) to make investment decisions that align with the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s financial goals, [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md), and [investment horizon](../i/investment_horizon.md). They conduct research, analyze [market](../m/market.md) trends, and execute trades accordingly. The [investor](../i/investor.md) may still receive periodic reports and summaries of account activity, but day-to-day decisions are handled by the designated professional.

### Fee Structure

Discretionary accounts often involve a [fee](../f/fee.md) structure based on assets under management (AUM) or a flat [fee](../f/fee.md) for services rendered. Some providers may also charge performance-based fees, where the advisor earns a higher [fee](../f/fee.md) if the account performs well relative to a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md).

## Benefits of Discretionary Accounts

### Professional Management

One of the primary benefits of discretionary accounts is the access to professional [investment management](../i/investment_management.md). Investors can [leverage](../l/leverage.md) the expertise of experienced financial advisors who have in-depth knowledge of markets and investment strategies.

### Time Efficiency

Discretionary accounts save time for investors who may not have the availability to monitor their investments continually. The advisor takes on the responsibility of tracking [market](../m/market.md) conditions and making timely decisions.

### Customization

Financial advisors can tailor investment strategies to the specific needs and preferences of the [investor](../i/investor.md). This customization can include considerations such as [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md), [time horizon](../t/time_horizon.md), [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) needs, and ethical or environmental preferences.

### Timely Decision Making

In fast-moving markets, the ability to act quickly can be crucial. Discretionary accounts allow advisors to make prompt decisions without waiting for [investor](../i/investor.md) approval, potentially capitalizing on fleeting opportunities.

### Reduced Emotional Decision-Making

Investors often make emotional decisions that can negatively impact their portfolios. By delegating decision-making authority to an advisor, the [risk](../r/risk.md) of emotional trading is minimized.

## Risks of Discretionary Accounts

### Trust and Transparency

Since the [investor](../i/investor.md) grants significant control to the advisor, [trust](../t/trust.md) is essential. There is a potential [risk](../r/risk.md) of misalignment between the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s interests and the advisor's decisions. Therefore, [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and regular communication are crucial to mitigate this [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Fee Structures

The [fee](../f/fee.md) structure associated with discretionary accounts can be higher than other types of accounts due to the professional management provided. Investors need to assess whether the potential benefits outweigh the costs.

### Overtrading

There is a [risk](../r/risk.md) of [overtrading](../o/overtrading.md), where the advisor engages in excessive buying and selling, potentially leading to increased [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md) and tax implications. Regulatory bodies often monitor this to protect investors.

### Performance Risks

Even with professional management, there is no guarantee of positive investment performance. [Market](../m/market.md) conditions and economic factors can still lead to losses.

## Setting Up a Discretionary Account

### Selecting a Broker or Advisor

Choosing the right [broker](../b/broker.md) or advisor is crucial when setting up a discretionary account. Investors should consider factors such as the advisor's experience, track record, investment philosophy, and fees. Reputable firms typically [offer](../o/offer.md) thorough background information on their advisors.

### Agreement and Documentation

Once an advisor is selected, the [investor](../i/investor.md) [will](../w/will.md) enter into a discretionary account agreement. This document outlines the terms of the relationship, the level of discretion granted, the [fee](../f/fee.md) structure, and other essential details. A [power of attorney](../p/power_of_attorney.md) form is typically included to legally enable the advisor to act on behalf of the [investor](../i/investor.md).

### Defining Investment Objectives

The [investor](../i/investor.md) and advisor [will](../w/will.md) work together to define the investment objectives, [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md), and specific preferences. This process often includes a detailed questionnaire and consultation to ensure the advisor fully understands the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s goals.

### Ongoing Monitoring and Communication

After the account is established, regular communication between the [investor](../i/investor.md) and advisor is vital. Periodic reviews, performance reports, and strategy discussions help ensure that the investment approach remains aligned with the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s objectives.

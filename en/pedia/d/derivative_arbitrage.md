# Derivative Arbitrage

Derivative [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) is a sophisticated trading strategy that aims to take advantage of pricing inefficiencies between related financial instruments in the [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) market. [Derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) are financial contracts whose value is derived from the performance of underlying assets, such as stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, interest rates, or market indexes. Various types of [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) include futures, options, swaps, and [forward contracts](../f/forward_contracts.md). [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) opportunities arise when these instruments are mispriced relative to each other or to the underlying assets they track.

## Types of Derivative Arbitrage

### 1. Cash-and-Carry Arbitrage

Cash-and-carry [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) involves taking advantage of the price difference between the futures market and the underlying spot market. This strategy typically involves the following steps:
1. **Buying the underlying asset in the spot market.**
2. **Simultaneously selling a futures contract on the same asset.**

The goal is to profit from the difference between the spot price and the futures price after accounting for carrying costs (such as storage costs, interest rates, and dividends). If the futures price is sufficiently higher than the spot price plus the carrying costs, the arbitrageur locks in a riskless profit.

### 2. Reverse Cash-and-Carry Arbitrage

Reverse cash-and-carry [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) is the inverse of the cash-and-carry strategy and involves taking advantage of a situation where the futures price is lower than the spot price minus the carrying costs. The steps are:
1. **[Short selling](../s/short_selling.md) the underlying asset in the spot market.**
2. **Simultaneously buying a futures contract on the same asset.**

The arbitrageur profits from the difference between the spot price and the futures price after accounting for carrying costs. This strategy is used when the futures market is trading at a discount to the spot market.

### 3. Convertible Arbitrage

Convertible [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) involves trading between convertible securities (such as convertible bonds) and their underlying stocks. Convertible bonds can be converted into a predetermined number of shares of the issuing companyâ€™s common stock. The [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategy typically involves:
1. **Buying the convertible bond.**
2. **Simultaneously [short selling](../s/short_selling.md) the underlying stock.**

The objective is to profit from the mispricing between the convertible bond and the underlying stock, with the added benefit of capturing interest income from the bond.

### 4. Option Arbitrage

Option [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) seeks to exploit inconsistencies in the pricing of options and the underlying assets. There are several option [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategies:

#### Box Spread Arbitrage
A box spread is an [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategy that involves creating a combination of bull and bear spreads using call and [put options](../p/put_options.md). The box spread typically involves:
1. **Buying a [bull call spread](../b/bull_call_spread.md) (buying a lower strike call option and selling a higher strike call option).**
2. **Buying a [bear put spread](../b/bear_put_spread.md) (buying a higher strike put option and selling a lower strike put option).**

If the combined cost of establishing the box spread is less than the difference in strike prices (adjusted for the present value), an [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) opportunity exists.

#### Calendar Spread Arbitrage
Calendar spread [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) exploits mispricing between options with different expiration dates but the same strike price. The strategy involves:
1. **Buying a longer-term option.**
2. **Simultaneously selling a shorter-term option.**

The expectation is that the options will converge in value as expiration approaches, and the trader profits from this convergence.

## Risks and Challenges of Derivative Arbitrage

### Execution Risk
[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategies often require executing multiple transactions simultaneously. Delays or failures in executing these transactions can erode potential profits.

### Liquidity Risk
Derivative [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) relies on the ability to buy and sell underlying assets or [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) without significantly impacting prices. A lack of liquidity can make it difficult to enter or exit positions at desired prices.

### Model Risk
[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategies often rely on complex [quantitative models](../q/quantitative_models.md) to identify mispricing. Errors in these models can lead to incorrect trading decisions and losses.

### Counterparty Risk
Derivative transactions often involve counterparties, such as brokers or clearing houses. If a counterparty fails to fulfill their obligations, it can result in losses for the arbitrageur.

### Regulatory Risk
Changes in regulations or market practices can affect the availability of [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) opportunities. For example, restrictions on [short selling](../s/short_selling.md) or changes in margin requirements can impact the effectiveness of certain [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategies.

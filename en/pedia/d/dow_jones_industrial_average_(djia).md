# Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), often simply referred to as "the Dow," is one of the most widely recognized [stock market](../s/stock_market.md) indices in the world. It serves as a barometer of the broader US [economy](../e/economy.md) by tracking 30 large, publicly-owned companies trading on the New York Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (NYSE) and the [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md). Established in 1896 by Charles Dow and Edward Jones, the DJIA has a storied history and has undergone many changes to remain relevant as a representation of the US industrial sector's health.

## History and Evolution

### Inception
The DJIA was initially composed of only 12 companies, mainly from the industrial sector, which was the economic driving force at the time. The original lineup included companies like American Tobacco, General Electric, and National Lead. Over the years, the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) has expanded to include 30 companies, with significant changes reflecting the evolving [economy](../e/economy.md).

### Modern Era
As the US [economy](../e/economy.md) shifted from [heavy industry](../h/heavy_industry.md) to technology and services, the composition of the DJIA has also changed. Companies such as Apple, Microsoft, and Cisco Systems have replaced industrial giants from years past. The [index](../i/index_instrument.md) is maintained by S&P Dow Jones Indices, which is a [joint](../j/joint.md) venture of S&P Global.

## Calculating the DJIA

### Price-Weighted Index
One key feature that sets the DJIA apart from other indices is its price-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) calculation methodology. In a [price-weighted index](../p/price-weighted_index.md), [stocks](../s/stock.md) with higher prices have more influence on the [index](../i/index_instrument.md)'s movement than those with lower prices. This contrasts with [market](../m/market.md)-cap [weighted](../w/weighted.md) indices like the S&P 500, where the size of the company ([market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md)) determines its influence.

### The Dow Divisor
To maintain consistency when companies split their [stocks](../s/stock.md) or when new companies are added, the DJIA uses a specialized constant called the "Dow Divisor." This divisor ensures that such corporate actions do not disproportionately affect the [index](../i/index_instrument.md)'s [value](../v/value.md).

## Components of the DJIA

### Industrials
Historically, the DJIA was dominated by industrial companies, such as:

- Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)
- 3M (MMM)
- Boeing (BA)

### Technology and Services
In recent years, the DJIA has diversified to include leaders in the technology and services sectors, such as:

- Apple Inc. (AAPL)
- Microsoft [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) (MSFT)
- The Walt Disney Company (DIS)

### Financials
Financial companies also form a significant part of the DJIA, including:

- Goldman Sachs (GS)
- JPMorgan Chase (JPM)
- American Express (AXP)

## Importance of the DJIA

### Economic Indicator
The DJIA is a critical [economic indicator](../e/economic_indicator.md). Movements in the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) are watched closely by investors, policy-makers, and the general public. It provides insights into the health of the [stock market](../s/stock_market.md) specifically and the [economy](../e/economy.md) in general.

### Investor Sentiment
The DJIA often reflects [investor](../i/investor.md) sentiment. A rising Dow usually indicates optimism about the [economy](../e/economy.md) and corporate [earnings](../e/earnings.md), while a falling Dow can signal caution or pessimism.

## Criticisms of the DJIA

### Price-Weighting
Critics argue that the price-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) methodology is arbitrary and can distort the true economic contribution of constituent companies. A high-priced stock can disproportionately influence the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) even if the company has a smaller [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) than other constituents.

### Limited Scope
With only 30 companies, the DJIA is less diversified compared to broader indices like the S&P 500 or the Russell 2000. Therefore, it may not fully capture the performance of the US [market](../m/market.md) as a whole.

### Lack of Sector Diversity
While the DJIA has incorporated more technology and service companies, it still lacks representation from some sectors, such as small and [mid-cap](../m/mid-cap.md) firms, which could provide a more balanced view of the [market](../m/market.md).

## The DJIA vs Other Indices

### DJIA vs S&P 500
The S&P 500 includes 500 of the largest US companies and is [market](../m/market.md)-cap [weighted](../w/weighted.md). This makes it more representative of the US [economy](../e/economy.md) than the DJIA, which comprises only 30 companies and is price-[weighted](../w/weighted.md).

### DJIA vs NASDAQ
The [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md) Composite includes thousands of companies, primarily from the [technology sector](../t/technology_sector.md). It provides a broader view of tech [stocks](../s/stock.md) compared to the DJIA.

## Key Historical Milestones

### Great Depression
The DJIA hit its peak before the 1929 [stock market crash](../s/stock_market_crash.md) and subsequently lost nearly 90% of its [value](../v/value.md). It took until the mid-1950s for the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) to regain its pre-crash highs.

### Dot-Com Bubble
During the late 1990s and early 2000s, the DJIA surged as tech [stocks](../s/stock.md) soared. However, the burst of the dot-com bubble led to significant losses.

### 2008 Financial Crisis
The DJIA experienced its most significant single-day point drop in September 2008 amid the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md). It took years to recover, highlighting the [index](../i/index_instrument.md)â€™s [volatility](../v/volatility.md) during economic upheaval.

### COVID-19 Pandemic
In 2020, the DJIA experienced unprecedented [volatility](../v/volatility.md). It hit record highs early in the year, plummeted in March due to pandemic fears, and then rebounded remarkably by year-end, showcasing the [market](../m/market.md)'s resilience.

## Investing in the DJIA

### Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)
Investors can [gain](../g/gain.md) exposure to the DJIA through ETFs like the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF [Trust](../t/trust.md) (DIA). These funds aim to replicate the performance of the DJIA.

### Mutual Funds
Some mutual funds also aim to track the performance of the DJIA, providing another avenue for investors to [gain](../g/gain.md) exposure.

## Conclusion

The Dow Jones Industrial Average remains a cornerstone of global [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). Despite its limitations and criticisms, it continues to [offer](../o/offer.md) valuable insights into the US [economy](../e/economy.md) and [investor](../i/investor.md) sentiment. As the [market](../m/market.md) evolves, so too [will](../w/will.md) the DJIA, adapting to reflect the ever-changing economic landscape.

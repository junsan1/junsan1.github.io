# Dark Pool

In the sophisticated world of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), there is a specialized area known as "[dark pools](../d/dark_pools.md)." They are a type of private financial forum or [exchange](../e/exchange.md) where trading securities are not openly visible to the public. [Dark pools](../d/dark_pools.md) facilitate the trading of large blocks of securities by institutional investors without impacting the public [market](../m/market.md) until after the trades have been executed. This detailed exploration dives into the intricacies of [dark pools](../d/dark_pools.md), their functionalities, advantages, controversies, regulations, and their role in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md).

## Overview of Dark Pools

[Dark pools](../d/dark_pools.md) are private exchanges created to provide [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) for large trades. Unlike public exchanges, where orders are displayed and matched with corresponding buy and sell orders, [dark pools](../d/dark_pools.md) allow buyers and sellers to remain anonymous. Their primary role is to minimize [market](../m/market.md) impact and price movement that might occur if such trades were executed on [open](../o/open.md) markets.

## Operation of Dark Pools

[Dark pools](../d/dark_pools.md) operate similarly to traditional exchanges but with key differences. Orders placed in a dark pool are not visible to other [market](../m/market.md) participants. They use a matching process known as "crossing" to pair buyers and sellers. Orders can be matched internally within the dark pool or with other [dark pools](../d/dark_pools.md).

## Types of Dark Pools

There are several types of [dark pools](../d/dark_pools.md), categorized based on who operates them and their matching processes:

### 1. Broker-Dealer-Owned Dark Pools

These are run by large [broker](../b/broker.md)-dealers, [matching orders](../m/matching_orders.md) internally from their clients. Examples include:

- **Goldman Sachs' Sigma X**: [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com)
- **J.P. Morgan's JPMX**: [J.P. Morgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com)

### 2. Agency Broker or Exchange-Owned Dark Pools

Operated independently of [broker](../b/broker.md)-dealers and [offer](../o/offer.md) a pure agency model where they facilitate trades without taking a [principal](../p/principal.md) position. Examples include:

- **Instinet**: [Instinet](https://www.instinet.com)
- **Liquidnet**: [Liquidnet](https://www.liquidnet.com)

### 3. Electronic Market Maker-Owned Dark Pools

Owned by electronic trading firms that match orders against their [inventory](../i/inventory.md). Examples include:

- **Getco**: [Getco](https://www.getcoller.net)

## Advantages of Dark Pools

[Dark pools](../d/dark_pools.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) several advantages:

1. **Reduced [Market](../m/market.md) Impact**: Large trades can be executed without significantly affecting [market](../m/market.md) prices.
2. **Anonymity**: [Market](../m/market.md) participants can execute trades without revealing their intentions to the public.
3. **Price Improvement**: Large investors can achieve better [execution](../e/execution.md) prices compared to public markets.

## Controversies and Criticisms

[Dark pools](../d/dark_pools.md) have faced various criticisms:

1. **Lack of [Transparency](../t/transparency.md)**: Critics argue that [dark pools](../d/dark_pools.md) lack the [transparency](../t/transparency.md) of public exchanges, potentially leading to price discrepancies and unfair trading advantages.
2. **[Market](../m/market.md) Fragmentation**: With numerous [dark pools](../d/dark_pools.md), [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) can be fragmented, making it harder to achieve optimal pricing and [execution](../e/execution.md).
3. **Regulatory Concerns**: Regulators are wary of the potential for [market manipulation](../m/market_manipulation.md) and unfair practices within [dark pools](../d/dark_pools.md).

## Regulatory Environment

Regulators worldwide have scrutinized [dark pools](../d/dark_pools.md) to ensure fair and transparent trading. Key regulations include:

### United States

- **Regulation ATS (Alternative [Trading Systems](../t/trading_systems.md))**: Requires [dark pools](../d/dark_pools.md) to register with the SEC and adhere to specific [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and reporting guidelines.

### Europe

- **[MiFID II](../m/mifid_ii.md) (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive)**: Introduced caps on dark pool trading volumes to ensure more trading occurs on transparent public markets.

## Role in Algorithmic Trading

[Dark pools](../d/dark_pools.md) play a significant role in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), where sophisticated algorithms are used to execute trades based on pre-defined criteria. [Dark pools](../d/dark_pools.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) algorithms various advantages such as:

### 1. Execution Algorithms

Algorithms can execute large orders in [dark pools](../d/dark_pools.md) to minimize [market](../m/market.md) impact and achieve better pricing.

### 2. Liquidity Seeking Algorithms

These algorithms scan [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [dark pools](../d/dark_pools.md) to find [hidden liquidity](../h/hidden_liquidity.md), executing trades in the most advantageous pools.

### 3. Smart Order Routing

Smart [order](../o/order.md) routers determine the best [execution](../e/execution.md) venue, including [dark pools](../d/dark_pools.md), based on real-time [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and price.

## Prominent Dark Pool Operators

Several firms are prominent in the dark pool space:

### 1. **Goldman Sachs' Sigma X**

Goldman Sachs operates one of the largest [dark pools](../d/dark_pools.md), Sigma X, which provides [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and anonymity to its clients.

### 2. **J.P. Morgan's JPMX**

J.P. Morgan's dark pool, JPMX, is known for its high trading volumes and advanced [matching algorithms](../m/matching_algorithms_in_trading.md).

### 1. Enhanced Transparency

Regulators are pushing for increased [transparency](../t/transparency.md) to ensure fair trading practices within [dark pools](../d/dark_pools.md).

### 2. Advanced Algorithms

The development of more sophisticated algorithms [will](../w/will.md) enhance dark pool trading [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and [execution](../e/execution.md) quality.

### 3. Integration with Public Markets

There may be greater integration between [dark pools](../d/dark_pools.md) and public markets to improve overall [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and [price discovery](../p/price_discovery.md).

## Conclusion

[Dark pools](../d/dark_pools.md) are a significant component of modern [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), providing a venue for large trades to occur discreetly and with minimal [market](../m/market.md) impact. While they [offer](../o/offer.md) numerous advantages, they also face challenges related to [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and regulatory scrutiny. As technology and regulations evolve, [dark pools](../d/dark_pools.md) [will](../w/will.md) continue to adapt, maintaining their crucial role in the broader financial ecosystem.

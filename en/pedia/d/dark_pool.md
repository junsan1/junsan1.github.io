# Dark Pool

In the sophisticated world of financial markets, there is a specialized area known as "dark pools." They are a type of private financial forum or exchange where trading securities are not openly visible to the public. Dark pools facilitate the trading of large blocks of securities by institutional investors without impacting the public market until after the trades have been executed. This detailed exploration dives into the intricacies of dark pools, their functionalities, advantages, controversies, regulations, and their role in algorithmic trading.

## Overview of Dark Pools

Dark pools are private exchanges created to provide liquidity for large trades. Unlike public exchanges, where orders are displayed and matched with corresponding buy and sell orders, dark pools allow buyers and sellers to remain anonymous. Their primary role is to minimize market impact and price movement that might occur if such trades were executed on open markets.

## Operation of Dark Pools

Dark pools operate similarly to traditional exchanges but with key differences. Orders placed in a dark pool are not visible to other market participants. They use a matching process known as "crossing" to pair buyers and sellers. Orders can be matched internally within the dark pool or with other dark pools.

## Types of Dark Pools

There are several types of dark pools, categorized based on who operates them and their matching processes:

### 1. Broker-Dealer-Owned Dark Pools

These are run by large broker-dealers, matching orders internally from their clients. Examples include:

- **Goldman Sachs' Sigma X**: [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com)
- **J.P. Morgan's JPMX**: [J.P. Morgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com)

### 2. Agency Broker or Exchange-Owned Dark Pools

Operated independently of broker-dealers and offer a pure agency model where they facilitate trades without taking a principal position. Examples include:

- **Instinet**: [Instinet](https://www.instinet.com)
- **Liquidnet**: [Liquidnet](https://www.liquidnet.com)

### 3. Electronic Market Maker-Owned Dark Pools

Owned by electronic trading firms that match orders against their inventory. Examples include:

- **Getco**: [Getco](https://www.getcoller.net)

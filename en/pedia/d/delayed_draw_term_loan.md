# Delayed Draw Term Loan

A Delayed Draw [Term Loan](../t/term_loan.md) (DDTL) is a specific type of [term loan](../t/term_loan.md) that allows the borrower to draw down funds over a specified period of time after the initial closing date, rather than receiving the full amount upfront. This type of [loan](../l/loan.md) structure provides flexibility for borrowers who may not need the entire [loan](../l/loan.md) amount immediately but anticipate needing access to [capital](../c/capital.md) in the future. DDTLs are commonly used in [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md), particularly for mergers and acquisitions, [capital](../c/capital.md) expenditures, or other significant investments.

## Key Characteristics of Delayed Draw Term Loans

### Draw Period

The draw period is the timeframe during which the borrower can draw down funds from the [loan](../l/loan.md). This period is set during the [loan](../l/loan.md) agreement's [negotiation](../n/negotiation.md) and can vary widely depending on the needs of the borrower and the [lender](../l/lender.md)'s terms. Typically, the draw period lasts from a few months to a few years.

### Commitment Fee

A commitment [fee](../f/fee.md) is a [fee](../f/fee.md) paid by the borrower to the [lender](../l/lender.md) in [exchange](../e/exchange.md) for the availability of the undrawn [loan](../l/loan.md) funds. This [fee](../f/fee.md) is generally calculated as a percentage of the undrawn amount and is paid periodically during the draw period. The purpose of the commitment [fee](../f/fee.md) is to compensate the [lender](../l/lender.md) for setting aside funds for the borrower’s future use.

### Interest Rate

The [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) on a DDTL can be either fixed or floating. A [fixed interest rate](../f/fixed_interest_rate.md) remains constant throughout the life of the [loan](../l/loan.md), while a floating rate fluctuates based on a [reference rate](../r/reference_rate.md), such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or the Secured Overnight [Financing](../f/financing.md) Rate (SOFR). The [interest](../i/interest.md) is typically only charged on the drawn portion of the [loan](../l/loan.md), not on the undrawn amount.

### Repayment Schedule

Similar to other term loans, DDTLs have a predetermined [repayment](../r/repayment.md) schedule. Once funds are drawn, they are usually converted into a [term loan](../t/term_loan.md) with set [repayment](../r/repayment.md) milestones. The [repayment](../r/repayment.md) schedule can be structured in various ways, such as equal installments or balloon payments at [maturity](../m/maturity.md).

### Covenants

Like other types of loans, DDTLs often include covenants that the borrower must adhere to during the life of the [loan](../l/loan.md). These can be financial covenants, such as maintaining a certain [debt](../d/debt.md)-to-[equity](../e/equity.md) ratio, or non-financial covenants, such as restrictions on additional borrowing or [asset](../a/asset.md) sales.

## Use Cases for Delayed Draw Term Loans

Delayed Draw Term Loans are particularly advantageous for specific [business](../b/business.md) needs where future funding is anticipated but not immediately required. Common use cases include:

### Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A)

In M&A scenarios, companies often arrange for [financing](../f/financing.md) ahead of finalizing a deal. A DDTL allows the acquiring company to commit to a [loan](../l/loan.md) without needing to draw the full amount until the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) closes.

### Capital Expenditures

Firms planning large [capital](../c/capital.md) expenditures, such as the purchase of machinery or the construction of new facilities, might not require the entire [loan](../l/loan.md) amount at once. A DDTL lets them draw funds as needed to match their expenditure schedule.

### Expansion Projects

For companies planning phased [expansion](../e/expansion.md) projects, a DDTL provides financial flexibility. They can access funds in stages as different phases of the project progress.

### Working Capital Management

Businesses that experience seasonal fluctuations in working [capital](../c/capital.md) needs can benefit from a DDTL by drawing funds only during peak periods and minimizing [interest](../i/interest.md) costs during off-peak periods.

## Advantages of Delayed Draw Term Loans

### Flexibility

One of the most significant advantages of DDTLs is the flexibility they [offer](../o/offer.md). Since borrowers only draw funds as needed, they can better match [financing](../f/financing.md) with their expenditures and potentially reduce overall borrowing costs.

### Reduced Interest Costs

[Interest](../i/interest.md) is only paid on the drawn portion of the [loan](../l/loan.md), not on the entire committed amount. This can result in significant [interest](../i/interest.md) savings, especially if the borrower does not draw the full [loan](../l/loan.md) amount.

### Staggered Expenditure

For projects or acquisitions requiring funds over time, a DDTL aligns the [loan](../l/loan.md) [disbursement](../d/disbursement.md) with the spending schedule, reducing the administrative complexities associated with managing separate loans for each phase.

### Enhanced Cash Flow Management

By drawing funds only when needed, companies can better manage their [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), ensuring that they are not over-burdened by [debt service](../d/debt_service.md) requirements from the onset.

## Disadvantages of Delayed Draw Term Loans

### Commitment Fees

Although the borrower saves on [interest](../i/interest.md) costs for undrawn amounts, they are usually required to pay a commitment [fee](../f/fee.md), which can add to the overall cost of borrowing.

### Complexity

DDTLs can be more complex to negotiate and administer than traditional term loans. The terms related to the draw period, covenants, and [repayment](../r/repayment.md) schedules may require more detailed legal and financial structuring.

### Lender Restrictions

Lenders providing DDTLs may impose strict covenants and conditions to mitigate their [risk](../r/risk.md), which can limit the borrower’s operational flexibility.

# Deep In The Money

In the world of trading [options](../o/options.md) and [financial derivatives](../f/financial_derivatives.md), one of the essential concepts that traders and investors need to understand is "Deep In The [Money](../m/money.md)" (DITM). This term describes a situation where an [options contract](../o/options_contract.md) is not just in the [money](../m/money.md) but significantly so, meaning the option has [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) far beyond its current [premium](../p/premium.md) that trades on the [market](../m/market.md). This concept is vital for understanding [risk](../r/risk.md)-reward profiles, strategic timing for executing trades, and opportunities for maximizing profitability.

## Understanding Options

Before diving into what "Deep In The [Money](../m/money.md)" means, it is crucial to first understand the basics of [options](../o/options.md). [Options](../o/options.md) are [financial derivatives](../f/financial_derivatives.md) that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy ([call option](../c/call_option.md)) or sell ([put option](../p/put.md)) an [asset](../a/asset.md) at a predetermined price ([strike price](../s/strike_price.md)) within a certain period. There are two main types of [options](../o/options.md):

1. **Call [Options](../o/options.md)**: These allow the holder to buy an [asset](../a/asset.md) at a specified price before the option expires.
2. **[Put Options](../p/put_options.md)**: These permit the holder to sell an [asset](../a/asset.md) at a specified price before the option expires.

[Options](../o/options.md) can be classified according to their moneyness:

- **In the [Money](../m/money.md) (ITM)**: When the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) is favorable compared to the current [market price](../m/market_price.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).
- **[At the Money](../a/at_the_money.md) (ATM)**: When the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) is approximately equal to the current [market price](../m/market_price.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).
- **Out of the [Money](../m/money.md) (OTM)**: When the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) is not favorable compared to the current [market price](../m/market_price.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

## What is Deep In The Money?

"Deep In The [Money](../m/money.md)" refers to [options](../o/options.md) that are significantly ITM. In mathematical terms, an option is typically considered deep in the [money](../m/money.md) if its [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) is far less (in case of [call option](../c/call_option.md)) or far more (in case of [put option](../p/put.md)) than the current [market price](../m/market_price.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

For example, assuming a stock is currently trading at $150:
- A [call option](../c/call_option.md) with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $100 is deep in the [money](../m/money.md) because $150 (current price) - $100 ([strike price](../s/strike_price.md)) = $50 of [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md).
- A [put option](../p/put.md) with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $200 is deep in the [money](../m/money.md) because $200 ([strike price](../s/strike_price.md)) - $150 (current price) = $50 of [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md).

### Intrinsic Value

The [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) plays a crucial role in defining deep ITM [options](../o/options.md). [Intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) is the actual [value](../v/value.md) of the option if it were exercised at this moment. For DITM [options](../o/options.md), this [value](../v/value.md) is high due to the significant difference between the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)â€™s current [market price](../m/market_price.md) and the option's [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).

## Advantages of Trading Deep In The Money Options

### Higher Delta

[Delta](../d/delta.md) represents the sensitivity of an option's price to the movement of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). Deep ITM [options](../o/options.md) typically have a [delta](../d/delta.md) close to 1 for call [options](../o/options.md) and -1 for [put options](../p/put_options.md), meaning they move almost dollar-for-dollar with the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). This high [delta](../d/delta.md) is appealing to traders who seek to mimic owning the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) while leveraging the flexibility and lesser [capital](../c/capital.md) requirement of [options](../o/options.md).

### Lower Time Decay

[Time decay](../t/time_decay.md), represented by the Greek letter [theta](../t/theta.md), indicates the rate at which an option loses [value](../v/value.md) as it approaches its [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md). DITM [options](../o/options.md) experience less [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) than ATM or OTM [options](../o/options.md) because their [value](../v/value.md) is primarily intrinsic rather than extrinsic. This makes DITM [options](../o/options.md) less sensitive to the passage of time, thereby preserving their [value](../v/value.md) longer during the [holding period](../h/holding_period.md).

### Strategic Flexibility

DITM [options](../o/options.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) strategic advantages for various trading approaches:
- **Hedging**: Investors often use DITM [options](../o/options.md) to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) their positions due to their high [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) and lower extrinsic cost.
- **Spread Strategies**: DITM [options](../o/options.md) are essential in constructing spread strategies like [bull](../b/bull.md) [spreads](../s/spreads.md) and bear [spreads](../s/spreads.md), increasing the likelihood of achieving the desired payoff.

### Potential for Lower Volatility Impact

Since DITM [options](../o/options.md) have high [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) and low [extrinsic value](../e/extrinsic_value.md), they are less affected by [volatility](../v/volatility.md) changes in the [market](../m/market.md). This means that the price of DITM [options](../o/options.md) does not fluctuate as much in response to changes in [volatility](../v/volatility.md), providing more stability for [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

## Risks Associated with Deep In The Money Options

### Limited Leverage

While DITM [options](../o/options.md) provide several advantages, their [leverage](../l/leverage.md) is lower compared to OTM [options](../o/options.md). As DITM [options](../o/options.md) are closer to the behavior of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), they [offer](../o/offer.md) less potential for massive percentage gains compared to highly leveraged OTM [options](../o/options.md).

### Capital Requirement

The [premium](../p/premium.md) for DITM [options](../o/options.md) is higher due to their significant [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md). This means traders need more [capital](../c/capital.md) to enter a DITM position, limiting accessibility for those with smaller trading accounts.

### Exercise Risk

For American-style [options](../o/options.md), which can be exercised at any point before expiration, holding DITM [options](../o/options.md) can bring unintended [exercise](../e/exercise.md) [risk](../r/risk.md). If the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price moves favorably before expiration, the option holder might face early [assignment](../a/assignment.md), requiring them to buy or sell the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), which may not be desirable in some [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

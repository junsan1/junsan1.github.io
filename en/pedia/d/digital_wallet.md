# Digital Wallet

Digital wallets, also known as e-wallets or mobile wallets, are financial accounts that allow users to store funds, make transactions, and track payment histories through their digital devices. These wallets can be utilized through smartphones, tablets, or computers, enabling users to perform various financial actions without the need to carry physical cash or cards. Digital wallets leverage secure technology features to protect user information and provide a reliable means of facilitating payments in both online and in-person environments.

## Types of Digital Wallets
Digital wallets can be categorized based on their functionalities and the platforms they operate on. There are a few primary types:

1. **Closed Wallets**: These are specific to particular merchants and allow users to make transactions solely within that merchant's ecosystem. For example, the wallet provided by Amazon allows users to store funds and use them only for purchases on Amazon.

2. **Semi-Closed Wallets**: These wallets can be used at a selected list of merchants and locations. For instance, Paytm is a semi-closed wallet widely accepted by many merchants across various industries.

3. **Open Wallets**: Open wallets are more versatile and can be used for a broader range of services, including sending money, withdrawing cash from ATMs, and conducting transactions at numerous merchants. Examples include PayPal and Apple Pay.

4. **Cryptocurrency Wallets**: These specialized wallets store digital currencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. They allow users to conduct blockchain transactions and hold private keys for digital asset ownership. An example is Coinbase Wallet.

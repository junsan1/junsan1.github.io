# Dividend Arbitrage

Dividend [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) is a sophisticated trading strategy employed primarily by hedge funds, institutional investors, and seasoned traders to exploit the differences in dividend payouts and related pricing mechanisms. This strategy involves executing trades around the ex-dividend dates of stocks, where an investor aims to benefit from price adjustments that occur when a stock goes ex-dividend.

## Basic Concepts

### Dividends and Ex-Dividend Dates
Dividends are periodic payments made by a corporation to its shareholders, typically derived from profits. The key dates associated with dividends are:
- **Declaration Date:** When the company announces the dividend.
- **Ex-Dividend Date:** The date on which the stock starts trading without the dividend value. Investors who buy the stock on or after this date are not entitled to receive the dividend.
- **Record Date:** The cut-off date to determine which shareholders are eligible to receive the dividend.
- **Payment Date:** The date the dividend is paid to shareholders.

### Price Adjustment on Ex-Dividend Date
On the ex-dividend date, the stock price typically drops by approximately the amount of the dividend. For instance, if a stock is priced at $100 and issues a $2 dividend, the stock price may drop by $2 to $98 on the ex-dividend date. This adjustment reflects the payout of the dividend.

## Dividend Arbitrage Strategy

Dividend [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) involves buying and shorting a stock in such a way that the investor can capture the dividend while minimizing exposure to price risk. Hereâ€™s how it usually works:

1. **Pre-Ex-Dividend Buy and Short Sell:**
   - An investor buys shares of a stock just before the ex-dividend date.
   - Simultaneously, the investor may short sell [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) or offset positions in options to hedge against the price drop expected on the ex-dividend date.

2. **Post Ex-Dividend Adjustment:**
   - After the stock goes ex-dividend, its price typically drops.
   - The investor receives the dividend payment but theoretically incurs a capital loss equivalent to the dividend through the stock price drop.

3. **Close Positions:**
   - The investor closes the long stock position and covers the short position.

## Example Scenario

Imagine a trader identifies a stock XYZ that will pay a $1 dividend. The stock currently trades at $50.

- **Step 1:** The trader buys 10,000 shares of XYZ at $50.
- **Step 2:** The trader short sells 200 [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) (or appropriate number of options contracts) on XYZ to hedge against the price drop.

On the ex-dividend date:

- XYZ's price drops to $49.
- The trader receives a $10,000 dividend ($1 * 10,000 shares).
- The paper loss due to the price drop is $10,000.

The hedge using futures or options mitigates the capital loss, aiming for a net profit from the dividend received.

## Complex Variants

### Options-Based Dividend Arbitrage
Investors may use options to enhance dividend [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) through the following choices:
- **Call and [Put Options](../p/put_options.md):** Buying in-the-money call options before ex-dividend and selling synthetic equivalent positions in [put options](../p/put_options.md).
- **Dividend Capture in Options:** Due to the drop in price equivalent to the dividend amount, the options pricing and exercising strategies can lead to capturing spread benefits.
  
### Cross-Market Arbitrage
This strategy can also be employed across different markets, including the CFDs, ADRs, and peer markets, where discrepancies in ex-dividend pricing mechanisms may exist.

### Risk Considerations
- **Market Movement:** Unexpected market movements can impact the anticipated outcomes.
- **Interest Rate Costs:** The cost of holding short positions or futures may affect profitability.
- **Corporate Actions:** Unexpected corporate actions (mergers, buybacks) can disrupt the strategy.

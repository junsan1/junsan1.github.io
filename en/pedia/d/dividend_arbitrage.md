# Dividend Arbitrage

[Dividend](../d/dividend.md) [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) is a sophisticated [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) employed primarily by [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds, institutional investors, and seasoned traders to exploit the differences in [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payouts and related pricing mechanisms. This strategy involves executing trades around the [ex-dividend](../e/ex-dividend.md) dates of [stocks](../s/stock.md), where an [investor](../i/investor.md) aims to benefit from price adjustments that occur when a stock goes [ex-dividend](../e/ex-dividend.md).

## Basic Concepts

### Dividends and Ex-Dividend Dates
Dividends are periodic payments made by a [corporation](../c/corporation.md) to its shareholders, typically derived from profits. The key dates associated with dividends are:
- **Declaration Date:** When the company announces the [dividend](../d/dividend.md).
- **[Ex-Dividend](../e/ex-dividend.md) Date:** The date on which the stock starts trading without the [dividend](../d/dividend.md) [value](../v/value.md). Investors who buy the stock on or after this date are not entitled to receive the [dividend](../d/dividend.md).
- **[Record Date](../r/record_date.md):** The cut-off date to determine which shareholders are eligible to receive the [dividend](../d/dividend.md).
- **[Payment](../p/payment.md) Date:** The date the [dividend](../d/dividend.md) is paid to shareholders.

### Price Adjustment on Ex-Dividend Date
On the [ex-dividend](../e/ex-dividend.md) date, the stock price typically drops by approximately the amount of the [dividend](../d/dividend.md). For instance, if a stock is priced at $100 and issues a $2 [dividend](../d/dividend.md), the stock price may drop by $2 to $98 on the [ex-dividend](../e/ex-dividend.md) date. This adjustment reflects the [payout](../p/payout.md) of the [dividend](../d/dividend.md).

## Dividend Arbitrage Strategy

[Dividend](../d/dividend.md) [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) involves buying and shorting a stock in such a way that the [investor](../i/investor.md) can capture the [dividend](../d/dividend.md) while minimizing exposure to price [risk](../r/risk.md). Hereâ€™s how it usually works:

1. **Pre-[Ex-Dividend](../e/ex-dividend.md) Buy and Short Sell:**
   - An [investor](../i/investor.md) buys [shares](../s/shares.md) of a stock just before the [ex-dividend](../e/ex-dividend.md) date.
   - Simultaneously, the [investor](../i/investor.md) may short sell [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) or [offset](../o/offset.md) positions in [options](../o/options.md) to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against the price drop expected on the [ex-dividend](../e/ex-dividend.md) date.

2. **Post [Ex-Dividend](../e/ex-dividend.md) Adjustment:**
   - After the stock goes [ex-dividend](../e/ex-dividend.md), its price typically drops.
   - The [investor](../i/investor.md) receives the [dividend](../d/dividend.md) [payment](../p/payment.md) but theoretically incurs a [capital](../c/capital.md) loss equivalent to the [dividend](../d/dividend.md) through the stock price drop.

3. **Close Positions:**
   - The [investor](../i/investor.md) closes the long stock position and covers the short position.

## Example Scenario

Imagine a [trader](../t/trader.md) identifies a stock XYZ that [will](../w/will.md) pay a $1 [dividend](../d/dividend.md). The stock currently trades at $50.

- **Step 1:** The [trader](../t/trader.md) buys 10,000 [shares](../s/shares.md) of XYZ at $50.
- **Step 2:** The [trader](../t/trader.md) short sells 200 [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) (or appropriate number of [options](../o/options.md) contracts) on XYZ to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against the price drop.

On the [ex-dividend](../e/ex-dividend.md) date:

- XYZ's price drops to $49.
- The [trader](../t/trader.md) receives a $10,000 [dividend](../d/dividend.md) ($1 * 10,000 [shares](../s/shares.md)).
- The paper loss due to the price drop is $10,000.

The [hedge](../h/hedge.md) using [futures](../f/futures.md) or [options](../o/options.md) mitigates the [capital](../c/capital.md) loss, aiming for a net [profit](../p/profit.md) from the [dividend](../d/dividend.md) received.

## Complex Variants

### Options-Based Dividend Arbitrage
Investors may use [options](../o/options.md) to enhance [dividend](../d/dividend.md) [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) through the following choices:
- **Call and [Put Options](../p/put_options.md):** Buying in-the-[money](../m/money.md) call [options](../o/options.md) before [ex-dividend](../e/ex-dividend.md) and selling synthetic equivalent positions in [put options](../p/put_options.md).
- **[Dividend](../d/dividend.md) Capture in [Options](../o/options.md):** Due to the drop in price equivalent to the [dividend](../d/dividend.md) amount, the [options](../o/options.md) pricing and exercising strategies can lead to capturing spread benefits.
  
### Cross-Market Arbitrage
This strategy can also be employed across different markets, including the CFDs, ADRs, and peer markets, where discrepancies in [ex-dividend](../e/ex-dividend.md) pricing mechanisms may exist.

### Risk Considerations
- **[Market](../m/market.md) Movement:** Unexpected [market](../m/market.md) movements can impact the anticipated outcomes.
- **[Interest Rate](../i/interest_rate.md) Costs:** The cost of holding short positions or [futures](../f/futures.md) may affect profitability.
- **Corporate Actions:** Unexpected corporate actions (mergers, buybacks) can disrupt the strategy.

## Leading Practitioners and Firms
Several [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds and [proprietary trading](../p/proprietary_trading.md) firms specialize in [dividend](../d/dividend.md) [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md). Examples include:

- **Citadel Securities:** A leading [market maker](../m/market_maker.md) that also dabbles in [systematic trading](../s/systematic_trading.md) strategies [Citadel Securities](https://www.citadelsecurities.com/).

## Conclusion
[Dividend](../d/dividend.md) [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) is a nuanced strategy requiring a deep understanding of [market](../m/market.md) mechanics, timing, and precise [execution](../e/execution.md). While it offers potential returns with reduced [risk](../r/risk.md) compared to outright position trades, it demands significant expertise, resources, and vigilance to manage associated risks and complexities.

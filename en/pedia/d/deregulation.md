# Deregulation

**Deregulation** refers to the process of removing or reducing state regulations, typically in the economic sphere. It is the opposite of regulation, which implies adding government controls or regulations. The process aims to improve the [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) of industries, increase competition, foster innovation, and enable a more dynamic and efficient [market](../m/market.md). However, it can also involve risks, such as reducing oversight that can lead to financial instability or harm to consumers and the environment. This article [will](../w/will.md) explore the history, impact, and various perspectives around the concept of deregulation, particularly in the context of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) (algotrading).

## Historical Context

### Origins
The concept of deregulation gained prominence in the late 20th century, particularly during the 1980s and 1990s. Influenced by neoliberal economic theories, several governments worldwide adopted deregulation policies to revitalise stagnant economies, reduce government expenditure, and foster [private sector](../p/private_sector.md) growth. Countries like the United States and the United Kingdom were at the forefront of implementing extensive deregulation policies.

### Key Milestones
1. **Airline Deregulation Act (1978):** This U.S. legislation removed government control over fares, routes, and [market](../m/market.md) entry from commercial aviation. The act aimed to increase competition and lower ticket prices.
2. **Telecommunications Act (1996):** This U.S. legislation significantly reduced the regulation of the telecommunications [industry](../i/industry.md), aiming to promote competition and innovation.
3. **Financial Services Modernization Act (1999):** Also known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, this law in the United States removed barriers in the [market](../m/market.md) among banking companies, securities companies, and [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies that prohibit any one institution from acting as any combination of an investment [bank](../b/bank.md), a [commercial bank](../c/commercial_bank.md), and an [insurance](../i/insurance.md) company.

## Deregulation in Financial Markets

### Pros of Deregulation in Financial Markets
1. **Enhanced [Efficiency](../e/efficiency.md):** Reduced restrictions can lead to lower costs for financial transactions and services, driving [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) in the [market](../m/market.md).
2. **Increased Competition:** Deregulation opens the [market](../m/market.md) to more players, thereby fostering competition. This can lead to better services and innovation.
3. **Greater Flexibility:** Financial institutions can [offer](../o/offer.md) new products and services that were previously restricted, responding more effectively to [market](../m/market.md) demands.

### Cons of Deregulation in Financial Markets
1. **[Market](../m/market.md) [Volatility](../v/volatility.md):** With fewer controls, markets can become more volatile, subject to rapid swings based on speculative or manipulative activities.
2. **[Systemic Risk](../s/systemic_risk.md):** The removal of regulations can lead to riskier financial practices, potentially culminating in economic crises, as seen in the 2008 financial meltdown.
3. **Consumer Protection:** Deregulation can diminish safeguards that protect consumers, leading to predatory practices and financial [fraud](../f/fraud.md).

### Case Study: The 2008 Financial Crisis
One of the most cited examples highlighting the risks of financial deregulation is the 2008 global [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md). The deregulation of the banking sector in the United States allowed financial institutions to engage in high-[risk](../r/risk.md) practices such as [subprime mortgage](../s/subprime_mortgage.md) lending. The lack of regulatory oversight enabled the proliferation of complex [financial derivatives](../f/financial_derivatives.md) that intensified the crisis.

## Deregulation and Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), or **algotrading**, has experienced significant growth in the backdrop of deregulated [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). Algorthmic trading leverages computer algorithms to execute trades at speeds and frequencies that human traders cannot match. This practice has had both positive and negative repercussions within deregulated markets.

### Benefits of Algotrading in Deregulated Markets
1. **[Liquidity Provision](../l/liquidity_provision.md):** Algorithms can provide [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) to markets by making it easier to buy and sell securities.
2. **Reduction of [Market](../m/market.md) Impact:** Algorithms can break down large orders into smaller ones, reducing the [market](../m/market.md) impact and achieving more favorable prices.
3. **[Operational Efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md):** Automated systems can operate continuously, analysing vast amounts of data to execute trades based on real-time information.

### Risks and Challenges
1. **[Flash Crashes](../f/flash_crashes.md):** The speed and automation of algotrading can lead to [flash crashes](../f/flash_crashes.md), moments when the price of securities drops rapidly within a very short time. A notable example is the Flash Crash of May 6, 2010, when major U.S. stock indices plummeted and rebounded within minutes.
2. **[Market Manipulation](../m/market_manipulation.md):** The complexity and opacity of algotrading can be exploited for manipulative practices such as [spoofing](../s/spoofing.md) and layering, where fake orders are placed to influence [market](../m/market.md) prices.
3. **Lack of [Transparency](../t/transparency.md):** Algorithms are typically proprietary, making it challenging to understand their impact on [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md) fully.

### Regulatory Responses
Despite the deregulatory [trend](../t/trend.md), regulators have taken steps to address the specific challenges posed by [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md):
1. **[Market](../m/market.md) Surveillance:** Enhanced monitoring systems to detect and mitigate abusive trading practices.
2. **Circuit Breakers:** Mechanisms designed to temporarily halt trading in the event of extreme [volatility](../v/volatility.md) to prevent [market](../m/market.md) collapses.
3. **[Order](../o/order.md)-to-[Trade](../t/trade.md) Ratios:** Limits on the ratio of orders placed to trades executed to deter manipulative practices and reduce [noise](../n/noise.md) in the [trading environment](../t/trading_environment.md).

### Key Stakeholders

Several firms and institutions have been at the center of algotrading and the discourse on deregulation:

- **Virtu Financial ([virtuwho](https://www.virtu.com))**: A leading [firm](../f/firm.md) in high-frequency trading, Virtu Financial has been pivotal in shaping the algotrading landscape.
- **Jane Street ([janestreet](https://www.janestreet.com))**: Known for its [quantitative trading](../q/quantitative_trading.md) models, Jane Street is a major player in algotrading, operating within various [asset](../a/asset.md) classes globally.
- **Goldman Sachs ([goldmansachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com))**: An [investment banking](../i/investment_banking.md) giant, Goldman Sachs has employed sophisticated [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) and maintained a significant presence in the global [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

## Conclusions

Deregulation carries both promises and perils. While it can lead to increased [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md), innovation, and competition, it also has the potential to introduce significant risks such as [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md), systemic risks, and reduced consumer protection. In the realm of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and algotrading, deregulation has enabled rapid advancements and growth. However, the complexities and challenges arising from algotrading necessitate a balanced approach to regulation that fosters innovation while safeguarding [market](../m/market.md) stability and consumer interests.

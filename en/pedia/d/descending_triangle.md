# Descending Triangle

A descending [triangle](../t/triangle.md) is a [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) chart pattern that appears in a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md) and is often considered a bearish signal. The pattern is characterized by a series of lower highs forming a descending [trendline](../t/trendline.md), while the lows form a horizontal support line. This pattern indicates that [supply](../s/supply.md) is more dominant than [demand](../d/demand.md), and it generally signals a potential continuation of the [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md) once the support line is broken. The descending [triangle](../t/triangle.md) pattern is used by traders to make informed decisions about [market](../m/market.md) trends and potential breakouts.

## Key Characteristics

1. **Lower Highs / Descending [Trendline](../t/trendline.md):** The upper boundary of the descending [triangle](../t/triangle.md) is a downward sloping line created by connecting the series of lower highs. Each high is lower than the previous high, indicating a weakening [demand](../d/demand.md).

2. **Horizontal Support Line:** The lower boundary is a [horizontal line](../h/horizontal_line.md) that connects [multiple](../m/multiple.md) points of support, showing that buyers are consistently stepping in at a certain [price level](../p/price_level.md).

3. **Converging Trendlines:** The two boundaries, the descending [trendline](../t/trendline.md) and the horizontal support line, converge to form a [triangle](../t/triangle.md) shape.

4. **[Duration](../d/duration.md):** The pattern can develop over a few weeks to many months. It's important for the pattern to be of sufficient [duration](../d/duration.md) to be considered reliable.

## Formation and Psychology

### Formation

The descending [triangle](../t/triangle.md) typically forms over a period where the [asset](../a/asset.md) is experiencing lower highs due to declining buying [interest](../i/interest.md), but is still finding consistent support at a certain [price level](../p/price_level.md). This causes the price to bounce between the descending [trendline](../t/trendline.md) and the horizontal support.

1. **Initial High and Initial Low:** The pattern starts with a significant high point, followed by a lower low which establishes the beginning of the support line.
2. **Subsequent Highs:** As the [asset](../a/asset.md) price rallies again but fails to reach the previous high, a new lower high is formed.
3. **Testing Support:** The [asset](../a/asset.md) price tests the established support level [multiple](../m/multiple.md) times, each time bouncing back but only to form a lower high.

### Psychology Behind the Pattern

1. **[Investor](../i/investor.md) Sentiment:** The descending [triangle](../t/triangle.md) pattern reflects waning [investor](../i/investor.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) and selling pressure dominating the [market](../m/market.md). The pattern showcases a bearish sentiment among traders.
2. **Seller Strength:** Each lower high indicates that sellers are entering the [market](../m/market.md) at progressively lower prices. They are eager to exit positions.
3. **Buyer Support:** The horizontal support line is formed because buyers are attempting to prevent the price from falling below a certain level. However, their strength is not enough to push prices higher, indicating a potential downside.

## Example Case

An exemplary instance of a descending [triangle](../t/triangle.md) pattern can be illustrated with a stock that trades at $50 and subsequently falls to establish initial support at $45. The stock rallies back to $48 but then falls again to test the support at $45. It rallies once more but only reaches $47 before retreating again to the $45 level. This [trend](../t/trend.md) continues, forming lower highs at $46.50 and $46, while continually testing the $45 support line.

## Trading the Descending Triangle

Trading the descending [triangle](../t/triangle.md) involves looking for a [breakout](../b/breakout.md) below the support line, as this is generally considered the confirmation signal that the bearish [trend](../t/trend.md) [will](../w/will.md) continue.

### Steps to Trade

1. **Entry Point:** The ideal entry point is when the price breaks below the horizontal support line with significant [volume](../v/volume.md). This [volume](../v/volume.md) is crucial because it confirms the strength of the [breakout](../b/breakout.md).
2. **Stop-Loss Placement:** To manage [risk](../r/risk.md), traders typically place [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md) above the last lower high of the descending [triangle](../t/triangle.md). This ensures that losses are minimized if the [breakout](../b/breakout.md) turns out to be false.
3. **Take-[Profit](../p/profit.md) Target:** A common method for determining the take-[profit](../p/profit.md) target is to measure the vertical height of the [triangle](../t/triangle.md) at its widest part and then subtract that distance from the [breakout](../b/breakout.md) point. For instance, if the height of the [triangle](../t/triangle.md) is $5, and the [breakout](../b/breakout.md) point is $45, the target price would be $40 ($45 - $5).

### Indicators and Tools

Traders often use additional [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicator.md) to confirm the [breakout](../b/breakout.md) and ensure it's not a false signal. Common tools include:

1. **[Volume Analysis](../v/volume_analysis.md):** A surge in [volume](../v/volume.md) during the [breakout](../b/breakout.md) indicates strong conviction among traders.
2. **Moving Averages:** Moving averages can help confirm the direction of the [trend](../t/trend.md). If the price is below major moving averages (like the 50-day or 200-day), it adds to the bearish outlook.
3. **[Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (RSI):** RSI can help gauge whether the [security](../s/security.md) is [oversold](../o/oversold.md) or [overbought](../o/overbought.md), providing additional context for the [breakout](../b/breakout.md).

## Reliability and Considerations

### Reliability

The descending [triangle](../t/triangle.md) is generally a reliable pattern, but like any [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) tool, it is not infallible. The reliability of the pattern increases with:

1. **[Duration](../d/duration.md):** Longer patterns (lasting several months) are typically more reliable than those forming over a few weeks.
2. **[Volume](../v/volume.md):** A higher [volume](../v/volume.md) on the [breakout](../b/breakout.md) increases the credibility of the pattern.
3. **Context:** It is most reliable in the context of a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md) or corrective phase within an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md).

### Considerations

1. **False Breakouts:** Traders must be wary of false breakouts. These occur when the price temporarily dips below the support level but quickly rebounds above it.
2. **[Market](../m/market.md) Conditions:** Broader [market](../m/market.md) conditions and news events can impact the effectiveness of the descending [triangle](../t/triangle.md) pattern. Sudden [market](../m/market.md) changes can render the pattern less predictive.
3. **Confirmations:** Using [multiple](../m/multiple.md) indicators to confirm the pattern can help in making more informed trading decisions.

## Real-World Examples

### Stock Market

In the [stock market](../s/stock_market.md), descending triangles can be observed in individual [stocks](../s/stock.md) or broader indices. For example:

- **Example Stock:** An example scenario could involve a stock like ABC Corp trading in a descending [triangle](../t/triangle.md), where the stock has consistently lower highs and a strong support level at $30. An eventual [breakout](../b/breakout.md) below $30 with increased [volume](../v/volume.md) would likely indicate a further decline in the stock's price.

### Cryptocurrency

Descending triangles are also prevalent in cryptocurrency markets due to their high [volatility](../v/volatility.md):

- **[Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) Example:** [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) often forms descending triangles during its bearish phases. For instance, if [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) trades between lower highs and a support level of $30,000, a [breakout](../b/breakout.md) below this level could indicate further declines.

### Forex

In Forex markets, [currency](../c/currency.md) pairs also demonstrate descending triangles:

- **EUR/USD Example:** If the EUR/USD [currency](../c/currency.md) pair forms a descending [triangle](../t/triangle.md) with highs decreasing from 1.2000 to 1.1800 and a strong support level at 1.1750, a breakdown below 1.1750 could signal further declines in the [Euro](../e/euro.md) against the Dollar.

## Conclusion

The descending [triangle](../t/triangle.md) is a powerful [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) tool for spotting bearish [continuation patterns](../c/continuation_patterns.md). It reflects the psychology of [market](../m/market.md) participants and highlights the dominance of sellers over buyers. Traders can [leverage](../l/leverage.md) this pattern to make informed decisions about potential price movements, entry and exit points, and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) strategies. However, it is crucial to use additional indicators and maintain a cautious approach to avoid [false signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md) and maximize the reliability of the descending [triangle](../t/triangle.md) in trading decisions.

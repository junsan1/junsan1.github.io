# Depositary Receipt

A Depositary Receipt (DR) is a type of financial [security](../s/security.md) that represents a stake in a foreign company that is held by a depositary [bank](../b/bank.md). These [receipts](../r/receipt.md) enable investors to [hold](../h/hold.md) [shares](../s/shares.md) in [equity](../e/equity.md) in a [corporation](../c/corporation.md) in another country, without the need to worry about cross-border and cross-[currency](../c/currency.md) transactions. Depositary [Receipts](../r/receipt.md) are a mechanism for companies that wish to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) from investors based in different countries while also expanding their [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) bases. 

## Types of Depositary Receipts

### American Depositary Receipt (ADR)
American Depositary [Receipts](../r/receipt.md) are DRs issued by U.S. depositary banks representing [shares](../s/shares.md) of a foreign (non-U.S.) company. These [shares](../s/shares.md) [trade](../t/trade.md) on U.S. stock markets such as the New York Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (NYSE) and [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md). ADRs make it easier for U.S. investors to invest in foreign companies, as transactions are conducted in U.S. dollars and under U.S. law. ADRs are further classified into different levels:

1. **Level I ADRs**: These are traded "over-the-counter" but not on U.S. exchanges. They have minimal reporting requirements and are less regulated.
  
2. **Level II ADRs**: These are [listed](../l/listed.md) on U.S. stock exchanges and have stricter regulatory requirements, including the need to file with the U.S. Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC).

3. **Level III ADRs**: These allow foreign companies to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) through the issuance of new [shares](../s/shares.md). Companies issuing Level III ADRs must comply with full SEC reporting requirements.

### Global Depositary Receipt (GDR)
Global Depositary [Receipts](../r/receipt.md) are similar to ADRs but are traded on international markets outside the U.S. GDRs [grant](../g/grant.md) the same benefits of ease of [transaction](../t/transaction.md) and reduced complexity. These are generally traded on European exchanges such as the London Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) and Luxemburg Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md).

### European Depositary Receipt (EDR)
European Depositary [Receipts](../r/receipt.md) are akin to GDRs, but specifically designed for the European [market](../m/market.md). They are typically traded on European stock exchanges and represent [shares](../s/shares.md) in non-European companies.

### International Depositary Receipt (IDR)
International Depositary [Receipts](../r/receipt.md) are generic terms used for depositary [receipts](../r/receipt.md) that can be [listed](../l/listed.md) anywhere in the world and not confined to a specific country or region.

## Key Participants in DR Issuance and Trading

### Issuer Company
The foreign company whose [shares](../s/shares.md) are represented by the depositary [receipts](../r/receipt.md). The company gains the benefit of being able to attract investment from foreign investors.

### Depositary Bank
A depositary [bank](../b/bank.md) is a financial institution that creates DRs by holding the actual [shares](../s/shares.md) in custody, usually in the company’s [home](../h/home.md) country but trading them in another. Some well-known depositary banks include:

- [Bank of New York Mellon](https://www.bnymellon.com/)
- [JPMorgan Chase & Co.](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/)
- [Citibank](https://www.citi.com/)

### Custodian Bank
The [custodian](../c/custodian.md) [bank](../b/bank.md) holds the original [shares](../s/shares.md) of the foreign company. This [bank](../b/bank.md) is usually located in the country of the issuing company and collaborates with the depositary [bank](../b/bank.md) to facilitate the process.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

1. **Access to Global Markets**: Investors can diversify their portfolios to include international securities without the complications of foreign [trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md).
  
2. **Simplicity**: Trading in DRs simplifies the process of purchasing foreign [shares](../s/shares.md) since all transactions are processed as if they were local investments, mitigating [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates and regulations.

3. **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)**: DRs generally [offer](../o/offer.md) higher [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) due to their listing on [multiple](../m/multiple.md) exchanges.

4. **[Capital](../c/capital.md) Raising**: [Issuer](../i/issuer.md) companies can tap into foreign [capital markets](../c/capital_markets.md) and reach a broader [investor](../i/investor.md) base.

### Disadvantages

1. **Regulatory Compliance**: Issuing DRs often requires satisfying regulatory standards in [multiple](../m/multiple.md) jurisdictions, which can be complex and costly.

2. **[Exchange Rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: Although transactions are conducted in the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s local [currency](../c/currency.md), fluctuations in [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates can affect the [value](../v/value.md) of the DR.

3. **Costs**: There might be various fees including issuance fees, custody fees, and [exchange](../e/exchange.md) fees, which can reduce the overall gains.

## Tax Implications

Tax treatment for [income](../i/income.md) received from DRs can be different from one country to another, as well as between the issuing country and the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s [domicile](../d/domicile.md) country. Typically, dividends from DRs may be subject to foreign tax [withholding](../w/withholding.md), and it’s crucial for investors to be aware of tax treaties that might mitigate [double taxation](../d/double_taxation.md).

## Trading Depositary Receipts

Depositary [Receipts](../r/receipt.md) are traded in the same manner as domestic [stocks](../s/stock.md). Investors buy and sell DRs using a [brokerage account](../b/brokerage_account.md), and transactions occur during the exchanges’ trading hours where the DRs are [listed](../l/listed.md). 

### Example of Companies Utilizing DRs

1. **Alibaba Group Holding Limited** (Ticker: BABA) trades its ADRs on the NYSE.
2. **Gazprom** has GDRs [listed](../l/listed.md) on the London Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md).
3. **Tata Motors** trades its ADRs on the NYSE.

## Conclusion

Depositary [Receipts](../r/receipt.md) serve as a valuable tool for both investors and companies. They enable the seamless integration of global markets, providing companies with access to foreign [capital](../c/capital.md) while [offering](../o/offering.md) investors a straightforward method to diversify and invest internationally.

# DAX Stock Index: Definition and Member Companies

The DAX (Deutscher Aktienindex) is Germany's leading stock market index, representing 30 of the largest and most liquid blue-chip companies traded on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. It is seen as a benchmark for the German economy and investor sentiment in the country. The index was created in 1988 by the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and mirrors the movements of the broader German stock market.

## Components and Selection Criteria

### Eligibility Criteria

To be included in the DAX, companies must:

1. Have their shares listed in the Prime Standard segment, which requires adherence to international transparency standards.
2. Be Xetra-traded continuously and to have a minimum free float of 10%.
3. Be one of the largest companies in terms of order book volume and market capitalization.
4. Meet certain financial criteria, ensuring the company is among the top-ranking firms in terms of trading volume and market value.

### Rebalancing

The composition of the DAX is reviewed quarterly to ensure it accurately represents the German stock market. Changes to the index are typically announced a few weeks in advance. The review dates are usually March, June, September, and December.

## Calculation

The DAX is a performance index, meaning it is calculated by reinvesting all dividends and considering capital gains. This differentiates it from a price index, where only capital gains are considered. The DAX's calculation begins at 1,000 points on December 30, 1987, and it is updated every second during trading hours.

### Formula

The index is calculated using the Laspeyres formula, which is a weighted arithmetic mean formula. The formula takes into account the current prices, the base, and the fixed component weights.

$$ \text{Index} = \left( \frac{\sum (P_t \cdot Q_0)}{\sum (P_0 \cdot Q_0)} \right) \times 1000 $$

Where:
- \( P_t \): Price of the component at time \( t \)
- \( Q_0 \): Initial quantity of shares
- \( P_0 \): Initial price

## Impact and Importance

The DAX is a critical indicator of German economic health and is used by investors worldwide to assess the performance of the German market. It is closely monitored by investors, analysts, and policymakers for a variety of reasons:

1. **Economic Indicator**: As it comprises Germany's top 30 companies, the DAX serves as a barometer of the country's economic health and investor confidence.
2. **Investment Benchmark**: Fund managers and investors often use the DAX as a benchmark to measure the performance of their investments in the German market.
3. **Market Sentiment**: Movements in the DAX reflect overall market sentiment. Significant drops or gains could indicate wider economic or financial trends.

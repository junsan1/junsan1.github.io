# Delta Neutral

[Delta](../d/delta.md) [neutral](../n/neutral.md) is a portfolio strategy that is designed to have a net zero exposure to changes in the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). This strategy combines long and short positions in a way that the sum of the deltas of these positions is equal to zero. The [delta](../d/delta.md) of an option measures the sensitivity of the option's price to changes in the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). Consequently, if a portfolio is [delta](../d/delta.md) [neutral](../n/neutral.md), this means that the portfolio's [value](../v/value.md) [will](../w/will.md) not be affected by small changes in the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

## Understanding Delta

Before delving deeply into [delta neutral strategies](../d/delta_neutral_strategies.md), it is essential to understand [delta](../d/delta.md) itself. [Delta](../d/delta.md) is a measure of the sensitivity of an option's price to a $1 change in the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). For instance, if the [delta](../d/delta.md) of a [call option](../c/call_option.md) is 0.5, then a $1 increase in the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) [will](../w/will.md) result in a $0.50 increase in the price of the [call option](../c/call_option.md). Conversely, for a [put option](../p/put.md) with a [delta](../d/delta.md) of -0.5, a $1 increase in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) [will](../w/will.md) result in a $0.50 decrease in the [put option](../p/put.md)'s price.

### Delta Values for Options

- **Call [Options](../o/options.md):** The [delta](../d/delta.md) of call [options](../o/options.md) ranges from 0 to +1. As the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) increases, the [delta](../d/delta.md) of the [call option](../c/call_option.md) moves closer to +1.
- **[Put Options](../p/put_options.md):** The [delta](../d/delta.md) of [put options](../p/put_options.md) ranges from -1 to 0. As the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) increases, the [delta](../d/delta.md) of the [put option](../p/put.md) moves closer to -1.

## Building a Delta Neutral Portfolio

A [delta](../d/delta.md) [neutral](../n/neutral.md) portfolio requires balancing the deltas of various positions so that the overall [delta](../d/delta.md) is zero. This can be achieved using [options](../o/options.md) and other financial instruments. Hereâ€™s an example:

1. **Stock and Option Combination:**
   - Suppose an [investor](../i/investor.md) owns 100 [shares](../s/shares.md) of a stock. The [delta](../d/delta.md) of the stock is +1 per share, so the total [delta](../d/delta.md) for 100 [shares](../s/shares.md) is +100.
   - To neutralize this [delta](../d/delta.md), the [investor](../i/investor.md) could sell call [options](../o/options.md) or buy [put options](../p/put_options.md) with a total [delta](../d/delta.md) of -100.
   
2. **[Multiple](../m/multiple.md) Option Positions:**
   - The [investor](../i/investor.md) could combine [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [options](../o/options.md) with varying deltas. For instance, if the [investor](../i/investor.md) sells 2 call [options](../o/options.md) with a [delta](../d/delta.md) of 0.5 each and buys 1 [put option](../p/put.md) with a [delta](../d/delta.md) of -1, the net [delta](../d/delta.md) would be 0 (2 * +0.5 - 1 = 0).

### Example

Let's build a [delta](../d/delta.md) [neutral](../n/neutral.md) portfolio using a stock and a [call option](../c/call_option.md).

- Long 100 [shares](../s/shares.md) of ABC stock ([delta](../d/delta.md) = +1 per share, total [delta](../d/delta.md) = +100).
- Sell 2 ABC call [options](../o/options.md) ([delta](../d/delta.md) = -0.5 per option, total [delta](../d/delta.md) for 2 [options](../o/options.md) = -100).

Net [delta](../d/delta.md) = +100 (stock) - 100 (call [options](../o/options.md)) = 0.

In this scenario, small changes in the price of ABC stock [will](../w/will.md) not affect the overall [value](../v/value.md) of the portfolio due to the offsetting deltas.

## Benefits of Delta Neutral Strategies

1. **[Market](../m/market.md) Neutrality:** The primary benefit of [delta neutral strategies](../d/delta_neutral_strategies.md) is that they are [market](../m/market.md)-[neutral](../n/neutral.md). This means that the portfolio is not biased towards bullish or bearish [market](../m/market.md) movements. 
2. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md):** These strategies help in managing the [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with price movements in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). By balancing the [delta](../d/delta.md), investors can [hedge](../h/hedge.md) their portfolios against unexpected [market](../m/market.md) swings.
3. **[Profit](../p/profit.md) from [Volatility](../v/volatility.md):** [Delta](../d/delta.md) [neutral](../n/neutral.md) portfolios can [profit](../p/profit.md) from changes in [volatility](../v/volatility.md), as the [value](../v/value.md) of [options](../o/options.md) is also dependent on [volatility](../v/volatility.md). Traders can exploit changes in implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md) without worrying about the price direction of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

## Implementation of Delta Neutral Strategies

### Dynamic Hedging

One of the widely-used methods of maintaining a [delta](../d/delta.md) [neutral](../n/neutral.md) portfolio is [dynamic hedging](../d/dynamic_hedging.md). [Dynamic hedging](../d/dynamic_hedging.md) involves frequently [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) the portfolio to ensure that it remains [delta](../d/delta.md) [neutral](../n/neutral.md) as [market](../m/market.md) conditions change. For example, if the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) changes, the [delta](../d/delta.md) of the [options](../o/options.md) [will](../w/will.md) also change, requiring adjustments to the positions.

#### Steps in Dynamic Hedging:
1. **Initial Setup:** Calculate the initial deltas of the positions and set up a [delta](../d/delta.md) [neutral](../n/neutral.md) portfolio.
2. **Monitor:** Continuously monitor the portfolio's [delta](../d/delta.md) as the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) changes.
3. **Rebalance:** Make necessary adjustments to the positions to bring the [delta](../d/delta.md) back to zero.

### Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading platforms](../a/algorithmic_trading_platforms.md) are particularly suited for implementing [delta neutral strategies](../d/delta_neutral_strategies.md) because they can automatically monitor and adjust the positions in real-time. Using sophisticated algorithms, the platforms can ensure that the portfolio remains [delta](../d/delta.md) [neutral](../n/neutral.md) without manual intervention.

#### Example Platform: Kace Capital Advisors

- [Kace Capital Advisors](https://www.kacecapitaladvisors.com/)

Kace [Capital](../c/capital.md) Advisors offers advanced trading solutions that include [delta neutral strategies](../d/delta_neutral_strategies.md). Their [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) systems help in dynamically hedging portfolios to maintain [delta](../d/delta.md) neutrality.

## Advanced Delta Neutral Strategies

### Gamma Scalping

[Gamma scalping](../g/gamma_scalping.md) is an advanced [delta](../d/delta.md) [neutral](../n/neutral.md) strategy that involves actively trading the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) to [profit](../p/profit.md) from changes in the [delta](../d/delta.md) of [options](../o/options.md). [Gamma](../g/gamma.md) measures the rate of change of [delta](../d/delta.md) with respect to changes in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price. By managing [gamma](../g/gamma.md), traders can more effectively maintain a [delta](../d/delta.md) [neutral](../n/neutral.md) position and [profit](../p/profit.md) from [market](../m/market.md) movements.

### Volatility Arbitrage

[Volatility arbitrage](../v/volatility_arbitrage.md) is another advanced strategy that involves taking advantage of differences between implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and [realized volatility](../r/realized_volatility.md). In a [delta](../d/delta.md) [neutral](../n/neutral.md) context, traders seek to [profit](../p/profit.md) from the [divergence](../d/divergence.md) between the [market](../m/market.md)'s expectations of [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and the actual [volatility](../v/volatility.md) observed in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

### Iron Condor and Iron Butterfly

[Iron condor](../i/iron_condor.md) and [iron butterfly](../i/iron_butterfly.md) are [options](../o/options.md) strategies that naturally lend themselves to [delta](../d/delta.md) [neutral](../n/neutral.md) positions. These strategies involve selling calls and puts at different strike prices, creating a [range](../r/range.md)-bound strategy that profits when the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) remains within a specific price [range](../r/range.md).

- **[Iron Condor](../i/iron_condor.md):** Involves selling an out-of-the-[money](../m/money.md) call and put and buying a further out-of-the-[money](../m/money.md) call and put.
- **[Iron Butterfly](../i/iron_butterfly.md):** Involves selling an at-the-[money](../m/money.md) call and put and buying further out-of-the-[money](../m/money.md) call and put.

## Risks Associated with Delta Neutral Strategies

Despite their benefits, [delta neutral strategies](../d/delta_neutral_strategies.md) are not without risks:

1. **[Transaction Costs](../t/transaction_costs.md):** Frequent [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) can result in significant [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md), especially in dynamic [hedging strategies](../h/hedging_strategies.md).
2. **[Model Risk](../m/model_risk.md):** [Delta](../d/delta.md) calculations and hedging rely on financial models that may not always accurately predict [market](../m/market.md) movements. Model inaccuracies can lead to imperfect hedging.
3. **[Volatility Risk](../v/volatility_risk.md):** While [delta neutral strategies](../d/delta_neutral_strategies.md) aim to mitigate directional [risk](../r/risk.md), they are still exposed to [volatility risk](../v/volatility_risk.md). Unanticipated spikes in [volatility](../v/volatility.md) can impact the portfolio's performance.

## Conclusion

[Delta neutral strategies](../d/delta_neutral_strategies.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) a sophisticated approach to managing [market risk](../m/market_risk.md) and profiting from [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md). By maintaining a balance of long and short positions that [offset](../o/offset.md) each other's deltas, investors can create portfolios that are insulated from small price movements in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). Both retail and institutional investors can [leverage](../l/leverage.md) [delta neutral strategies](../d/delta_neutral_strategies.md) through [dynamic hedging](../d/dynamic_hedging.md) and [algorithmic trading platforms](../a/algorithmic_trading_platforms.md), each providing unique advantages and risks. As with any [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md), a thorough understanding of the risks and continuous monitoring are essential for successful implementation.

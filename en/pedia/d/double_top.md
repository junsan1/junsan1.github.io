# Double Top

In technical analysis, a double top is a bearish reversal pattern that typically signals the end of an uptrend. This pattern is recognized by two peaks of approximately equal height that are separated by a valley. The double top is one of the most commonly used chart patterns in algotrading due to its relative ease of identification and high predictive value.

## Structure of a Double Top Pattern

A double top pattern consists of four key elements:

1. **First Peak**: The market reaches a new high, which is then followed by a decline. This high is considered the first peak.
2. **Trough**: After the first peak, the price declines to a support level, known as the trough.
3. **Second Peak**: The price subsequently rebounds to a level near the first peak, forming the second peak.
4. **Breakout (Neckline)**: Once the price falls below the trough level, it confirms the double top pattern, which is also referred to as the "neckline" or "confirmation line."

### Characteristics

- **Height and Width**: The peaks can vary in height and width, but in a typical double top, both peaks are of almost the same height. The trough should also be of a reasonable depth to signify a clear price decline.
- **Volume**: Volume generally increases during the formation of the first peak and drops during the second peak. A significant increase in volume during the breakout confirms the pattern.
- **Time Frame**: The time frame between the peaks can range from a few days to several months. Traders often consider longer time frames more reliable indicators.

## Importance in Algotrading

### Predictive Power

The double top pattern is considered highly reliable in predicting reversal trends. Algotrading systems use this pattern to execute trades that profit from the anticipated price decline following the confirmation of the pattern.

### Automation

The structure and form of a double top make it amenable to automated detection using computational algorithms. Algotrading software can be programmed to scan price charts and automatically identify double top formations.

### Integration with Indicators

Double tops can be integrated with other technical indicators to enhance the accuracy of trade signals. Algorithms often combine double tops with Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Averages, and Volume indicators to filter out false signals.

## Example of Algorithm Implementation

### Pseudocode

Here is a simplified pseudocode to detect a double top pattern:
```
function detectDoubleTop(prices):
  peaks = findPeaks(prices)
  trough = findTrough(peaks)
  
  if peak[1] almostEqual(p[2]) and volumeDuring(peak[1]) > volumeDuring(trough):
    if prices.breakBelow(trough):
      return "Double Top Detected"

  return "No Double Top"
```

### Python Example

Below is an example of how one might implement the detection of a double top pattern in Python:
```python
import numpy as np

def find_peaks(prices):
    # Simplified peak detection logic
    peaks = []
    for i in range(1, len(prices)-1):
        if prices[i-1] < prices[i] > prices[i+1]:
            peaks.append((i, prices[i]))
    return peaks

def find_trough(peaks, prices):
    trough_index = min(range(peaks[0][0] + 1, peaks[1][0]), key=lambda i: prices[i])
    return trough_index, prices[trough_index]

def detect_double_top(prices):
    peaks = find_peaks(prices)
    if len(peaks) < 2:
        return "No Double Top"
    
    trough_index, trough_price = find_trough(peaks, prices)
    peak1, peak2 = peaks[0][1], peaks[1][1]
    
    if np.isclose(peak1, peak2, atol=0.01):
        if prices[trough_index] > prices[peaks[1][0]]:
            return "Double Top Detected at index", peaks[1][0]
    
    return "No Double Top"

# Example usage
prices = np.array([100, 110, 120, 115, 110, 120, 115, 100, 90])
print(detect_double_top(prices))
```

## Trading Strategies Based on Double Top

### Short Selling

One common trading strategy upon identifying a confirmed double top is short selling. This involves borrowing shares to sell at the current high price with the intention of buying them back at a lower price once the market declines.

### Stop-Loss and Take-Profit

Setting strategic stop-loss and take-profit levels is crucial. The stop-loss is generally placed slightly above the second peak, while the take-profit level may be set at a distance equating to the height of the double top pattern beneath the neckline.

### Leverage with Other Patterns

Algotraders often combine the double top pattern with other chart patterns and indicators for a more comprehensive trading strategy. For instance, patterns like Head and Shoulders or indicators like MACD can validate the signal inferred from the double top.

## Limitations and Considerations

### False Signals

While the double top is a reliable indicator, it is not infallible. False signals can occur, and thus it's essential to use supplementary indicators or filters to confirm the pattern.

### Market Conditions

Double tops are more effective in markets characterized by high volatility. In low volatility environments, the pattern may produce fewer reliable signals.

### Pattern Symmetry

Perfect symmetry in double tops is rare. Traders and algorithms must account for slight variations in peak heights and trough depths to avoid premature or delayed trade entries.

### External Factors

Market events, such as economic news and global financial events, can influence the effectiveness of technical patterns like the double top. Algorithms should be programmed to pause or modify trading activity during such times to avoid erratic market behavior.

## Conclusion

The double top pattern remains an essential tool in the arsenal of both manual and algorithmic traders. Its straightforward identification, combined with a considerable degree of reliability, makes it a popular choice for predicting market reversals. By leveraging modern computational tools and integrating multiple indicators, traders and developers can enhance the efficacy of trading strategies based on double tops. However, it is equally important to remain cautious of the limitations and to use comprehensive risk management techniques to ensure consistent trading success.

# Distributed Ledger Technology

Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) refers to a digital system for recording the [transaction](../t/transaction.md) of assets in which transactions and their details are stored in [multiple](../m/multiple.md) places at the same time. Unlike traditional databases, [distributed ledgers](../d/distributed_ledgers.md) have no central data store or administration functionality. This technology, synonymous with [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) to some extent, offers a high level of [security](../s/security.md) and [transparency](../t/transparency.md) by decentralizing data storage.

## Components of Distributed Ledger Technology

### Nodes
Nodes are the individual devices or participants in the DLT network. Each node stores a replicated copy of the ledger and participates in the consensus process. Nodes can be categorized as full nodes, which store the entire [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) and validate transactions, and lightweight nodes, which store partial data and rely on full nodes for validation.

### Transactions
Transactions are the smallest units of a DLT. They represent the transfer of assets or information between parties and are grouped into blocks. These transactions are validated by consensus mechanisms before being permanently added to the ledger.

### Consensus Mechanisms
DLTs rely on consensus mechanisms to validate transactions and ensure all nodes agree on the state of the ledger. Common mechanisms include Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), and Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT). Each mechanism has its own balance of [security](../s/security.md), speed, and cost-effectiveness.

### Smart Contracts
[Smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md) are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They automatically enforce and execute the terms of the agreement once predefined conditions are met, reducing the need for intermediaries.

## Types of Distributed Ledgers

### Blockchain
[Blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) is the most well-known type of DLT. It structures data into blocks that are linked together in a chain using cryptographic hashes. This structure ensures data integrity and prevents tampering.

### Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
DAG-based ledgers, such as [IOTA](../i/iota.md)'s Tangle, allow for more scalable and efficient [transaction](../t/transaction.md) processing than traditional [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md). Instead of blocks, transactions are linked together in a graph structure, enabling [multiple](../m/multiple.md) transactions to be processed in parallel.

### Holochain
Holochain is a distributed computing network where every agent (node) maintains its own local chain but can interact with other agents' chains. This approach offers high [scalability](../s/scalability.md) by reducing the consensus overhead typical in [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) systems.

## Key Features of Distributed Ledger Technology

### Decentralization
One of the core principles of DLT is decentralization, which eliminates the need for a central authority. This enhances [security](../s/security.md) and [trust](../t/trust.md), as no single entity controls the network.

### Transparency
All transactions recorded on a distributed ledger are visible to all participants. This [transparency](../t/transparency.md) ensures accountability and reduces the potential for [fraud](../f/fraud.md).

### Immutability
Once a [transaction](../t/transaction.md) is recorded on a DLT, it cannot be altered or deleted. This immutability ensures the integrity of the data and provides a reliable historical record.

### Security
DLTs use advanced cryptographic techniques to secure transactions and prevent unauthorized access. This makes DLTs highly resistant to hacking and cyber-attacks.

## Applications of Distributed Ledger Technology

### Finance
DLT has revolutionized the [financial sector](../f/financial_sector.md) by enabling faster, cheaper, and more secure [transaction](../t/transaction.md) processing. Cryptocurrencies like [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) and [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) are prime examples of DLT in [finance](../f/finance.md), providing decentralized digital currencies and financial services.

### Supply Chain
DLTs enhance [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md) [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and traceability by recording every [transaction](../t/transaction.md) in the [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md) process. Walmart, for example, uses [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) to track the provenance of food products, ensuring food safety and quality.

### Healthcare
In healthcare, DLT can secure patient data, streamline medical records, and facilitate data sharing among healthcare providers while maintaining patient privacy. Companies like Medicalchain [leverage](../l/leverage.md) [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) to create transparent, tamper-proof health records.

### Real Estate
DLT can simplify [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) transactions by providing a transparent and immutable record of property ownership and transfer. Propy, a [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md)-based [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) platform, allows users to buy and sell properties using [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md), reducing the need for intermediaries.

### Governance
DLT can improve governance by providing transparent and tamper-proof voting systems. This ensures the integrity of elections and enhances public [trust](../t/trust.md) in the electoral process.

## Challenges and Limitations

### Scalability
DLTs often face [scalability](../s/scalability.md) challenges, particularly in high-[transaction](../t/transaction.md) environments. Consensus mechanisms like PoW can be resource-intensive, slowing down [transaction](../t/transaction.md) processing times.

### Interoperability
Different DLT platforms may not be compatible with each other, hindering the seamless integration and [exchange](../e/exchange.md) of data across systems.

### Regulatory Compliance
The decentralized nature of DLT can create regulatory challenges, as existing laws and regulations may not adequately address the nuances of DLT-based systems.

### Energy Consumption
Some consensus mechanisms, particularly PoW, require significant computational power and energy, raising concerns about their environmental impact.

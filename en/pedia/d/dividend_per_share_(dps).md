# Dividend Per Share (DPS)

[Dividend](../d/dividend.md) Per Share (DPS) is a financial metric that indicates the amount of cash dividends distributed to each share of a company's outstanding [common stock](../c/common_stock.md). The DPS figure is critical for investors because it provides a gauge of the [income](../i/income.md) generated by an investment in a company's [shares](../s/shares.md). This metric is typically expressed in monetary terms and is calculated for a specified period, usually on an annual [basis](../b/basis.md).

## Calculation of DPS

The basic formula to calculate DPS is:

```
DPS = Total Dividends Paid / [Shares](../s/shares.md) Outstanding
```

Here, "Total Dividends Paid" refers to the total amount of dividends declared by the company during a specified period, and "[Shares](../s/shares.md) Outstanding" represents the total number of [shares](../s/shares.md) that the company has issued and are currently held by shareholders.

### Example Calculation

Suppose a company pays $10 million in total dividends and has 5 million [shares](../s/shares.md) outstanding. The DPS would be calculated as follows:

```
DPS = $10,000,000 / 5,000,000 = $2
```

This means that each [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) would receive $2 for every share they own.

## Importance of DPS

DPS is an essential metric for several reasons:

1. **[Income](../i/income.md) Generation**: For [income](../i/income.md)-focused investors, DPS is a critical [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of the [return](../r/return.md) they can expect in the form of dividends. It helps them estimate the [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) they [will](../w/will.md) receive from [investing](../i/investing.md) in the company's [shares](../s/shares.md).
  
2. **Company Stability**: A consistent or growing DPS is often a sign of a company's [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and stability. It suggests that the company has sufficient [earnings](../e/earnings.md) to [return](../r/return.md) to its shareholders while still [investing](../i/investing.md) in growth and operations.
  
3. **Comparison Across Companies**: DPS allows investors to compare the [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payouts of different companies, helping them make informed investment decisions. A higher DPS might indicate a more generous [dividend policy](../d/dividend_policy.md), although it is essential to consider other factors like [dividend](../d/dividend.md) sustainability.

## Factors Influencing DPS

Several factors can affect a company's ability to pay dividends and, consequently, its DPS:

1. **[Earnings](../e/earnings.md)**: The company's profits are the primary source of dividends. A company with higher [earnings](../e/earnings.md) is more likely to distribute higher dividends.
  
2. **[Payout Ratio](../p/payout_ratio.md)**: This is the proportion of [earnings](../e/earnings.md) a company pays out as dividends. A higher [payout ratio](../p/payout_ratio.md) means a larger share of [earnings](../e/earnings.md) is distributed as dividends, potentially increasing the DPS.
  
3. **[Retained Earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md)**: Companies may retain a portion of their [earnings](../e/earnings.md) for [reinvestment](../r/reinvestment.md) in the [business](../b/business.md). High [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md) may reduce the amount available for dividends.
  
4. **[Economic Conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md)**: Economic downturns can impact a company's profitability, leading to lower dividends and subsequently a lower DPS.
  
5. **Corporate Strategy**: Some companies prioritize growth and [expansion](../e/expansion.md) over [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payouts. These companies might have low or no dividends, resulting in a lower DPS.

## DPS vs. Earnings Per Share (EPS)

While DPS and [Earnings](../e/earnings.md) Per Share (EPS) are related, they are not the same. EPS measures the company's net [income](../i/income.md) divided by the number of outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md), indicating how much [profit](../p/profit.md) is attributed to each share. DPS, on the other hand, shows how much of that [profit](../p/profit.md) is distributed to shareholders as dividends.

A company might have a high EPS but a low DPS if it decides to reinvest most of its [earnings](../e/earnings.md) back into the [business](../b/business.md) rather than paying them out as dividends.

## Historical Context and Trends

Historically, [dividend](../d/dividend.md) policies and, consequently, DPS have evolved significantly. In the early 20th century, companies were inclined to pay out a large portion of their [earnings](../e/earnings.md) as dividends. Over time, as companies began to reinvest more in growth opportunities, the average [payout](../p/payout.md) ratios declined. However, certain industries, such as utilities and [consumer staples](../c/consumer_staples.md), continue to maintain higher [payout](../p/payout.md) ratios and thus higher DPS due to their stable [earnings](../e/earnings.md) and lower growth opportunities.

## Impact of Share Buybacks on DPS

[Share buybacks](../s/share_buybacks.md), or repurchases, can affect the DPS because they reduce the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) outstanding. 

```
DPS = Total Dividends Paid / [Shares](../s/shares.md) Outstanding (Post-[Buyback](../b/buyback.md))
```

For example, if a company pays $10 million in dividends and buys back 1 million [shares](../s/shares.md), resulting in 4 million [shares](../s/shares.md) outstanding:

```
DPS = $10,000,000 / 4,000,000 = $2.50
```

Therefore, [share buybacks](../s/share_buybacks.md) can effectively increase DPS by reducing the denominator in the DPS formula.

## Dividend Reinvestment Plans (DRIPs)

Companies often [offer](../o/offer.md) [Dividend Reinvestment](../d/dividend_reinvestment.md) Plans (DRIPs), allowing shareholders to reinvest their cash dividends into additional [shares](../s/shares.md) of the company at no extra cost or at a discounted price. While this doesn't directly impact the DPS calculation, it provides a mechanism for shareholders to compound their returns.

## Conclusion

[Dividend](../d/dividend.md) Per Share (DPS) is a vital financial metric that provides insights into a company's [dividend policy](../d/dividend_policy.md) and [financial health](../f/financial_health.md). By understanding DPS, investors can make more informed decisions, particularly those focused on [income](../i/income.md) generation and financial stability. DPS also serves as a useful tool for comparing [dividend](../d/dividend.md) distributions across different companies and industries.

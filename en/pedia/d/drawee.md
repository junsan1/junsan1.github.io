# Drawdown

Drawdown is a critical concept in the world of trading and [investment management](../i/investment_management.md). It refers to the peak-to-[trough](../t/trough.md) decline during a specific recorded period of an investment, [trading account](../t/trading_account.md), or [fund](../f/fund.md). It is usually quoted as the percentage between the peak and the [trough](../t/trough.md). Understanding drawdown is essential for both individual investors and institutional traders, as it helps gauge [risk](../r/risk.md) and the potential for loss in any given strategy or portfolio.

## Types of Drawdown

### 1. **Absolute Drawdown**
Absolute drawdown is the difference between the initial [capital](../c/capital.md) and the smallest point below the initial [capital](../c/capital.md). This metric is crucial for understanding the worst-case scenario in terms of actual loss.

### 2. **Maximum Drawdown**
Maximum drawdown (MDD) is one of the most commonly used metrics to evaluate the [risk](../r/risk.md) of a portfolio. It represents the maximum loss from a peak to a [trough](../t/trough.md) of a portfolio, before a new peak is attained. 

### 3. **Relative Drawdown**
Relative drawdown is expressed as a percentage and is the ratio of the current drawdown to the historical [equity](../e/equity.md) high.

## Importance of Drawdown

### **1. Risk Management**
Drawdown measures are vital in the assessment of trading [risk](../r/risk.md). Traders often set maximum allowable drawdowns that if exceeded, trigger predetermined [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) actions.

### **2. Performance Evaluation**
By examining drawdown values, investors can identify the robustness and reliability of different [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

### **3. Psychological Impact**
High drawdowns can have a significant negative psychological impact on traders and investors, potentially leading to poor decision-making and strategy abandonment.

## Drawdown Calculation

The formula to calculate drawdown is:

\[ \text{Drawdown} = \frac{\text{[Trough](../t/trough.md) [Value](../v/value.md) - Peak [Value](../v/value.md)}}{\text{Peak [Value](../v/value.md)}} \]

This can be broken into computational steps, especially in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) systems, where continuous monitoring of drawdowns is necessary.

## Managing Drawdown

### **1. Diversification**
Diversifying investments can mitigate the impact of drawdowns by spreading [risk](../r/risk.md) across various assets or strategies.

### **2. Stop-Loss Orders**
Automatic [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md) can limit potential losses by automatically closing a position when it reaches a predefined loss threshold.

### **3. Periodic Portfolio Rebalancing**
Regularly adjusting the proportions of assets in a portfolio helps in maintaining the desired [risk](../r/risk.md) level.

## Tools and Technologies

Several companies [offer](../o/offer.md) tools and services to manage and analyze drawdowns. Here are some notable ones:

## Conclusion

Understanding drawdown and its implications is essential for anyone involved in trading and [investing](../i/investing.md). It serves as a critical measure of [risk](../r/risk.md) and performance, allowing traders and investors to make informed decisions and employ strategic [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices.

# Delisting

Delisting refers to the removal of a [listed security](../l/listed_security.md) from a stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md), meaning the [security](../s/security.md) [will](../w/will.md) no longer be traded on that [exchange](../e/exchange.md). This concept is critical in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), affecting a [range](../r/range.md) of stakeholders including investors, companies, regulatory bodies, and [market](../m/market.md) participants.

## Types of Delisting

There are primarily two types of delisting: Voluntary and Involuntary.

### Voluntary Delisting

Voluntary delisting occurs when a company decides to remove its stock from the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) on its own accord. Reasons for this could include:
- **[Privatization](../p/privatization.md):** A company may choose to go private, often through a [buyout](../b/buyout.md) or management-led initiative.
- **[Merger](../m/merger.md) or [Acquisition](../a/acquisition.md):** If a company is acquired or merges with another company, the new entity may delist the old company's [shares](../s/shares.md).
- **Compliance Costs:** The regulatory and compliance costs associated with being [listed](../l/listed.md) can be substantial. Smaller companies may find it financially burdensome to comply with all [listing requirements](../l/listing_requirements.md).
- **Strategic Reorientation:** The company might decide that being [listed](../l/listed.md) on an [exchange](../e/exchange.md) no longer aligns with its strategic objectives.

### Involuntary Delisting

Involuntary delisting occurs when a stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md) decides to remove a company's securities because it no longer meets the [exchange](../e/exchange.md)'s requirements. The criteria can include: 
- **[Financial Distress](../f/financial_distress.md):** If a company is facing [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) or severe financial difficulties, it may be delisted.
- **Regulatory Non-Compliance:** Companies must adhere to certain regulatory standards to remain [listed](../l/listed.md). Non-compliance often leads to delisting.
- **[Market Capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) and Share Price:** Exchanges often have minimum thresholds for [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) and share price. If a company falls below these, it risks delisting.
- **Public [Interest](../i/interest.md) Concerns:** Issues related to [fraud](../f/fraud.md), misrepresentation, or ethical lapses can trigger a delisting.

## Consequences of Delisting

The removal from a stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md) has several implications:

### For the Company

- **Loss of [Market](../m/market.md) [Visibility](../v/visibility.md):** Delisting reduces the company's [visibility](../v/visibility.md) and can make it more difficult to attract investors.
- **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) Issues:** [Shares](../s/shares.md) become less [liquid](../l/liquid.md), as they are no longer easily traded on a major [exchange](../e/exchange.md).
- **Potential Legal Actions:** In some cases, especially with involuntary delisting, the company could face lawsuits or regulatory penalties.

### For Shareholders

- **Reduced [Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md):** Shareholders may find it harder to buy or sell their [shares](../s/shares.md), impacting their ability to exit their investment.
- **[Valuation](../v/valuation.md) [Uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md):** The lack of a public [market](../m/market.md) can complicate the [valuation](../v/valuation.md) of [shares](../s/shares.md).
- **Loss of [Transparency](../t/transparency.md):** Public companies are subject to rigorous reporting requirements. Once delisted, the level of publicly available information typically diminishes.

## Case Studies

### Tesla's Consideration for Delisting

Tesla, Inc., led by CEO Elon Musk, famously considered [going private](../g/going_private.md) in 2018. Musk used Twitter to announce that he was considering taking Tesla private and had "funding secured" for the move. This led to significant [market](../m/market.md) [speculation](../s/speculation.md) and regulatory scrutiny. Eventually, Tesla remained a [public company](../p/public_company.md), but the incident highlighted how delisting can be considered by even high-profile public companies.

### Luckin Coffee

In 2020, Chinese coffee chain Luckin Coffee was delisted from the [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md) following an investigation that revealed the company had fabricated sales numbers. This is an example of involuntary delisting due to regulatory non-compliance and ethical issues.

## The Delisting Process

### Voluntary Delisting

1. **Board Approval:** The company's board must approve the decision to delist.
2. **[Shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) Vote:** Often, shareholders must also approve the delisting.
3. **Notification:** The company must notify the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) and regulatory bodies.
4. **Public Announcement:** A public announcement is usually required to inform investors.
5. **Grace Period:** There is often a grace period during which the [shares](../s/shares.md) continue to [trade](../t/trade.md) before delisting occurs.

### Involuntary Delisting

1. **[Exchange](../e/exchange.md) Notification:** The [exchange](../e/exchange.md) notifies the company that it is non-compliant.
2. **Rectification Period:** The company is often given a period to rectify the issues.
3. **Hearing:** Some exchanges provide for a hearing where the company can argue against the delisting.
4. **Final Decision:** If the issues are not rectified, the final decision to delist is made.
5. **Public Announcement:** The delisting is publicly announced.

## Regulatory Environment

Different countries have their own regulations and processes for delisting. For instance:

### United States

The U.S. Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) oversees delisting procedures. Exchanges like the NYSE and [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md) have specific rules and [listing requirements](../l/listing_requirements.md) companies must follow. 

### European Union

The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) provides guidelines on delisting, but specific rules can vary by country within the EU.

### India

The Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) Board of India (SEBI) governs listing and delisting activities. Companies must follow SEBI's delisting regulations, which outline the steps for voluntary and involuntary delisting.

## Impact on Algo Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), or algo trading, refers to the use of automated software to execute trades. Delisting impacts algo trading in several ways:

- **Strategy Adjustment:** Algorithms must be updated to exclude delisted [stocks](../s/stock.md), which can affect [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).
- **[Market](../m/market.md) Data Feeds:** Real-time data feeds must be adjusted to ensure they do not include delisted securities.
- **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) Models:** Algo traders rely on [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) data that must be recalibrated following delisting events.

## Conclusion

Delisting is a complex process that can happen for various reasons, both voluntary and involuntary. It impacts companies, shareholders, and the broader [market](../m/market.md), including aspects like [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), [valuation](../v/valuation.md), and regulatory compliance. Understanding the nuances of delisting is essential for investors and [market](../m/market.md) participants to navigate the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) effectively.

# Distributed Ledgers

Distributed ledgers are a type of database that is consensually shared, replicated, and synchronized across [multiple](../m/multiple.md) nodes in a network. Unlike traditional centralized databases that reside in a single location, a distributed ledger has no central administrator. Instead, the ledger is maintained by a network of nodes, each of which holds an identical copy of the ledger's data. This decentralized approach offers several benefits, including enhanced [security](../s/security.md), [transparency](../t/transparency.md), and redundancy.

## Types of Distributed Ledgers

### 1. Blockchain

[Blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) is the most well-known type of distributed ledger. It consists of a chain of blocks, each containing a list of transactions. The [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) grows as new blocks are added in a linear, chronological [order](../o/order.md). Each block is linked to the previous one through a cryptographic [hash](../h/hash.md), which makes it extremely difficult to alter past data without affecting subsequent blocks. This immutability is one of the key features that makes [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) secure.

#### Bitcoin Blockchain

[Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) was the first implementation of [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology. It was introduced in 2008 by an anonymous entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto. The [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) serves as a public ledger for all transactions that occur within the [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) network. Miners validate and add new transactions by solving complex mathematical problems, a process known as proof-of-work.

#### Ethereum Blockchain

[Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) is another prominent [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) platform, created by [Vitalik Buterin](../v/vitalik_buterin.md) in 2015. Unlike [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md), which primarily focuses on peer-to-peer transactions, [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) is a more versatile platform that supports [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md). [Smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md) are self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code. They enable decentralized applications (dApps) to run on the [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) network.

### 2. Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)

Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is another type of [distributed ledger technology](../d/distributed_ledger_technology.md). Unlike [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md), DAG does not use a linear chain of blocks. Instead, it employs a structure where transactions are directly linked to each other, forming a web-like pattern. This design can potentially [offer](../o/offer.md) higher [scalability](../s/scalability.md) and faster [transaction](../t/transaction.md) speeds.

#### IOTA

[IOTA](../i/iota.md) is a well-known example of a DAG-based ledger designed for the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem. It uses a unique consensus mechanism called the Tangle. In the Tangle, each [transaction](../t/transaction.md) must approve two previous transactions, creating a mesh of interlinked transactions. This structure allows [IOTA](../i/iota.md) to achieve high [throughput](../t/throughput.md) and zero [transaction fees](../t/transaction_fees.md).

### 3. Hashgraph

Hashgraph is another type of distributed ledger that aims to solve some of the limitations of [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology. It employs a consensus algorithm called Gossip about Gossip, combined with virtual voting. In Hashgraph, nodes share information by gossiping with their neighbors, and consensus is reached through virtual votes based on the history of these gossip events.

#### Hedera Hashgraph

Hedera Hashgraph is a public network that uses the Hashgraph consensus algorithm. It aims to [offer](../o/offer.md) high [throughput](../t/throughput.md), low latency, and fair ordering of transactions. Hedera's governing council includes major organizations like Google, IBM, and Boeing, providing a level of [trust](../t/trust.md) and stability to the network.

## Key Components of Distributed Ledgers

### 1. Nodes

Nodes are individual participants in the network that maintain a copy of the distributed ledger. They can be full nodes, which store the entire ledger, or lightweight nodes, which only store a subset of the data. Nodes communicate with each other to propagate transactions and reach consensus.

### 2. Transactions

Transactions are the fundamental units of data that are recorded in the ledger. They represent the transfer of assets, [execution](../e/execution.md) of [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md), or any other state change within the network. Transactions are cryptographically signed to ensure authenticity and integrity.

### 3. Consensus Mechanisms

Consensus mechanisms are protocols used by nodes to agree on the state of the ledger. Different distributed ledgers use various consensus mechanisms, including:

- **Proof of Work (PoW):** Used by [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md), PoW requires miners to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions.
- **Proof of Stake (PoS):** Used by [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) 2.0, PoS selects validators based on the amount of cryptocurrency they [hold](../h/hold.md) and are willing to "stake" as [collateral](../c/collateral.md).
- **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS):** Used by [EOS](../e/eos.md), DPoS involves stakeholders voting to elect a small number of delegates who validate transactions on their behalf.
- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT):** Used by [Hyperledger Fabric](../h/hyperledger_fabric.md), BFT algorithms tolerate a certain number of faulty or malicious nodes while still reaching consensus.

### 4. Cryptography

Cryptographic techniques are fundamental to the [security](../s/security.md) and functionality of distributed ledgers. They are used to sign transactions, generate unique addresses, and ensure the immutability and integrity of the data.

- **[Hash](../h/hash.md) Functions:** Produce a fixed-size [hash](../h/hash.md) from input data, ensuring data integrity. Common [hash](../h/hash.md) functions include SHA-256 and SHA-3.
- **Public Key Cryptography:** Uses pairs of public and private keys to sign transactions and encrypt data. Examples include RSA and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC).

## Applications of Distributed Ledgers

### 1. Financial Services

Distributed ledgers have the potential to revolutionize the financial [industry](../i/industry.md) by providing faster, cheaper, and more secure transactions. They can be used for peer-to-peer payments, cross-border transfers, and digital [asset](../a/asset.md) issuance.

#### Example: Ripple

[Ripple](../r/ripple.md) is a distributed ledger platform focused on enabling real-time, cross-border payments. It uses the XRP Ledger, which employs a consensus protocol to validate transactions. [Ripple](../r/ripple.md) aims to provide a faster and more cost-effective alternative to traditional [payment](../p/payment.md) systems like SWIFT.

Solutions like sharding, layer-2 protocols, and alternative consensus mechanisms are being explored to address this [issue](../i/issue.md).

### 2. Energy Consumption

Consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work (PoW) are energy-intensive, leading to concerns about their environmental impact. More energy-efficient alternatives like Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of Authority (PoA) are being developed to mitigate this [issue](../i/issue.md).

### 3. Regulatory and Legal Issues

The regulatory landscape for distributed ledgers is still evolving. Compliance with existing laws and regulations, such as those related to data privacy and financial transactions, remains a significant challenge. Additionally, the lack of standardization and interoperability between different platforms can hinder widespread adoption.

### 4. Security Risks

While distributed ledgers [offer](../o/offer.md) enhanced [security](../s/security.md) features, they are not immune to risks. Potential vulnerabilities include 51% attacks, where a malicious entity gains control of the majority of the network's computational power, and smart contract bugs that can lead to unintended consequences.

### 5. Usability

The complexity of [distributed ledger technology](../d/distributed_ledger_technology.md) can be a barrier to mainstream adoption. User-friendly interfaces, better educational resources, and seamless integration with existing systems are needed to make the technology more accessible to the general public and businesses.

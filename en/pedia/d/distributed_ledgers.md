# Distributed Ledgers

Distributed ledgers are a type of database that is consensually shared, replicated, and synchronized across multiple nodes in a network. Unlike traditional centralized databases that reside in a single location, a distributed ledger has no central administrator. Instead, the ledger is maintained by a network of nodes, each of which holds an identical copy of the ledger's data. This decentralized approach offers several benefits, including enhanced security, transparency, and redundancy.

## Types of Distributed Ledgers

### 1. Blockchain

Blockchain is the most well-known type of distributed ledger. It consists of a chain of blocks, each containing a list of transactions. The blockchain grows as new blocks are added in a linear, chronological order. Each block is linked to the previous one through a cryptographic hash, which makes it extremely difficult to alter past data without affecting subsequent blocks. This immutability is one of the key features that makes blockchain secure.

#### Bitcoin Blockchain

Bitcoin was the first implementation of blockchain technology. It was introduced in 2008 by an anonymous entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto. The Bitcoin blockchain serves as a public ledger for all transactions that occur within the Bitcoin network. Miners validate and add new transactions by solving complex mathematical problems, a process known as proof-of-work.

#### Ethereum Blockchain

Ethereum is another prominent blockchain platform, created by Vitalik Buterin in 2015. Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily focuses on peer-to-peer transactions, Ethereum is a more versatile platform that supports smart contracts. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code. They enable decentralized applications (dApps) to run on the Ethereum network.

### 2. Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)

Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is another type of distributed ledger technology. Unlike blockchain, DAG does not use a linear chain of blocks. Instead, it employs a structure where transactions are directly linked to each other, forming a web-like pattern. This design can potentially offer higher scalability and faster transaction speeds.

#### IOTA

IOTA is a well-known example of a DAG-based ledger designed for the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem. It uses a unique consensus mechanism called the Tangle. In the Tangle, each transaction must approve two previous transactions, creating a mesh of interlinked transactions. This structure allows IOTA to achieve high throughput and zero transaction fees.

### 3. Hashgraph

Hashgraph is another type of distributed ledger that aims to solve some of the limitations of blockchain technology. It employs a consensus algorithm called Gossip about Gossip, combined with virtual voting. In Hashgraph, nodes share information by gossiping with their neighbors, and consensus is reached through virtual votes based on the history of these gossip events.

#### Hedera Hashgraph

Hedera Hashgraph is a public network that uses the Hashgraph consensus algorithm. It aims to offer high throughput, low latency, and fair ordering of transactions. Hedera's governing council includes major organizations like Google, IBM, and Boeing, providing a level of trust and stability to the network.

## Key Components of Distributed Ledgers

### 1. Nodes

Nodes are individual participants in the network that maintain a copy of the distributed ledger. They can be full nodes, which store the entire ledger, or lightweight nodes, which only store a subset of the data. Nodes communicate with each other to propagate transactions and reach consensus.

### 2. Transactions

Transactions are the fundamental units of data that are recorded in the ledger. They represent the transfer of assets, execution of smart contracts, or any other state change within the network. Transactions are cryptographically signed to ensure authenticity and integrity.

### 3. Consensus Mechanisms

Consensus mechanisms are protocols used by nodes to agree on the state of the ledger. Different distributed ledgers use various consensus mechanisms, including:

- **Proof of Work (PoW):** Used by Bitcoin, PoW requires miners to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions.
- **Proof of Stake (PoS):** Used by Ethereum 2.0, PoS selects validators based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and are willing to "stake" as collateral.
- **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS):** Used by EOS, DPoS involves stakeholders voting to elect a small number of delegates who validate transactions on their behalf.
- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT):** Used by Hyperledger Fabric, BFT algorithms tolerate a certain number of faulty or malicious nodes while still reaching consensus.

### 4. Cryptography

Cryptographic techniques are fundamental to the security and functionality of distributed ledgers. They are used to sign transactions, generate unique addresses, and ensure the immutability and integrity of the data.

- **Hash Functions:** Produce a fixed-size hash from input data, ensuring data integrity. Common hash functions include SHA-256 and SHA-3.
- **Public Key Cryptography:** Uses pairs of public and private keys to sign transactions and encrypt data. Examples include RSA and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC).

## Applications of Distributed Ledgers

### 1. Financial Services

Distributed ledgers have the potential to revolutionize the financial industry by providing faster, cheaper, and more secure transactions. They can be used for peer-to-peer payments, cross-border transfers, and digital asset issuance.

# Distressed Securities

Distressed securities represent financial instruments from companies that are struggling with their financial [obligations](../o/obligation.md) or are undergoing [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md). This includes [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, and other forms of [debt](../d/debt.md) from companies with significant financial difficulties. Distressed securities are often characterized by their substantial discounts compared to their [face value](../f/face_value.md) due to the perceived [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with the issuing company's financial instability.

### Background and Characteristics
Distressed securities are typically available for purchase at significantly reduced prices because they involve higher risks. Investors in distressed securities are often looking for deep discounts on assets that they believe might be [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) due to temporary [financial distress](../f/financial_distress.md).

Key characteristics include:
- **High [Yield](../y/yield.md):** Distressed securities often come with a high [yield](../y/yield.md) to attract investors willing to take on the associated risks. This can represent a large potential [return](../r/return.md) if the company recovers.
- **[Market](../m/market.md) [Volatility](../v/volatility.md):** The prices of distressed securities are usually very volatile due to [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) about the company's future.
- **High [Risk](../r/risk.md):** [Investing](../i/investing.md) in distressed securities carries a significant [risk](../r/risk.md) of losing the entire investment if the company fails to recover or if [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) leads to [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md).
- **Complexity:** [Investing](../i/investing.md) in distressed securities often involves understanding complex financial and legal issues, including [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) law and [restructuring](../r/restructuring.md) processes.

### Types of Distressed Securities
Distressed securities can be divided into two main categories:

1. **Distressed [Debt](../d/debt.md):** This includes bonds, [bank](../b/bank.md) [debt](../d/debt.md), and other borrowings of companies under financial duress. Distressed [debt](../d/debt.md) often trades at a deep [discount](../d/discount.md) to its [par value](../p/par_value.md) and provides investors with an opportunity to potentially realize significant returns if the company successfully reorganizes or emerges from [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md).

2. **Distressed [Equity](../e/equity.md):** This includes common and [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md) of companies facing financial challenges. Distressed [equity](../e/equity.md) holders stand behind [debt](../d/debt.md) holders in the [capital structure](../c/capital_structure.md) and can be wiped out if the company liquidates. However, they can also see substantial gains if the company's fortunes improve.

### Investing in Distressed Securities
[Investing](../i/investing.md) in distressed securities involves several strategies and requires careful research and analysis. Here are some core strategies and considerations:

#### Value Investing
[Value](../v/value.md) investors look for distressed securities that they believe are [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) by the [market](../m/market.md). They rely on thorough analysis to uncover opportunities where the [market](../m/market.md) may have overreacted to negative news or [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) a company's [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets.

#### Active Management and Turnaround Specialists
Some investors take an active role in managing the distressed company. These [turnaround](../t/turnaround.md) specialists often try to improve operational efficiencies, [refinance](../r/refinance.md) [debt](../d/debt.md), or restructure the company to [return](../r/return.md) it to [financial health](../f/financial_health.md). This can involve negotiating with creditors, cutting costs, or selling off non-core assets.

#### Event-Driven Strategies
Event-driven strategies focus on specific events that may impact the [value](../v/value.md) of distressed securities. This includes [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) filings, [restructuring](../r/restructuring.md) announcements, or regulatory changes. Investors may seek to [profit](../p/profit.md) from the price movements triggered by these events.

#### Risks
[Investing](../i/investing.md) in distressed securities comes with numerous risks, including:
- **[Default Risk](../d/default_risk.md):** The primary [risk](../r/risk.md) is that the company may [default](../d/default.md) on its [obligations](../o/obligation.md), leading to significant losses.
- **[Liquidity Risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md):** Distressed securities can be very illiquid, making it difficult to buy or sell positions without affecting the [market price](../m/market_price.md).
- **[Operational Risk](../o/operational_risk.md):** The [firm](../f/firm.md)'s operational problems may be more severe than anticipated, complicating efforts to turn around the company.
- **Legal and [Regulatory Risk](../r/regulatory_risk.md):** Navigating [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) laws and [restructuring](../r/restructuring.md) agreements involves complex legal and regulatory challenges that can affect the [value](../v/value.md) of investments.

### Market Dynamics
The distressed securities [market](../m/market.md) is influenced by various macroeconomic factors, including:

- **[Economic Cycles](../e/economic_cycles.md):** In economic downturns, more companies struggle financially, increasing the [supply](../s/supply.md) of distressed securities.
- **[Credit](../c/credit.md) [Market](../m/market.md) Conditions:** Tight [credit](../c/credit.md) conditions can exacerbate financial troubles for companies, increasing [default](../d/default.md) rates and the number of distressed securities available.
- **Regulatory Environment:** Changes in [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) laws, financial regulations, and [accounting](../a/accounting.md) standards can impact distressed securities.

### Major Players and Examples

### Case Studies and Historical Examples
Some notable case studies and historical examples of distressed securities [investing](../i/investing.md) include:

- **General Motors (2009):** During the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md), General Motors filed for [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md). Investors who purchased GM's distressed [debt](../d/debt.md) and participated in its [restructuring](../r/restructuring.md) eventually saw significant returns as the company emerged from [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) and returned to profitability.
- **[Lehman Brothers](../l/lehman_brothers.md) (2008):** The collapse of [Lehman Brothers](../l/lehman_brothers.md) during the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) led to a [wealth](../w/wealth.md) of distressed [debt](../d/debt.md). Savvy investors who navigated the complex [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) process were able to [profit](../p/profit.md) from the eventual settlement of claims.
- **American Airlines (2011):** American Airlines' [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) led to opportunities in its distressed [equity](../e/equity.md) and [debt](../d/debt.md). Once the company successfully reorganized and merged with US Airways, investors in its distressed securities saw substantial gains.

### Conclusion
Distressed securities [offer](../o/offer.md) opportunities for potentially high returns but come with significant risks and complexities. Investors in this space often need a deep understanding of [finance](../f/finance.md), law, and the specifics of the company's situation. While the potential rewards can be substantial, the risks—ranging from [default](../d/default.md) to legal challenges—require careful consideration and [active management](../a/active_management.md). The [market](../m/market.md) for distressed securities is dynamic, influenced by [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md) and regulatory changes, making it a compelling but challenging area of investment.

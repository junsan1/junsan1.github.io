# Delivered Ex Ship (DES)

Delivered Ex Ship (DES) is a term used in international shipping and [trade](../t/trade.md) contracts. It is one of the [Incoterms](../i/incoterms.md) (International Commercial Terms) defined by the International Chamber of [Commerce](../c/commerce.md) (ICC). These terms are widely used in global [trade](../t/trade.md) to clearly communicate the tasks, costs, and risks associated with the transportation and delivery of goods. DES specifies certain responsibilities and [obligations](../o/obligation.md) for both the seller and the buyer during the shipment process.

## Definition

Under the DES term, the seller is responsible for delivering the goods to the buyer on board a ship at the destination port. The seller assumes all costs and risks associated with transporting the goods to that point, excluding the unloading costs and customs duties. Once the goods are delivered on board the ship at the destination port, the [risk](../r/risk.md) is transferred from the seller to the buyer.

### Key Responsibilities

1. **Seller:**
    - Deliver the goods on board the ship at the destination port.
    - Cover all transportation costs and risks to the destination port.
    - Provide the necessary documents for the buyer to take possession of the goods.
    - Comply with [export](../e/export.md) formalities and pay any [export](../e/export.md) duties.

2. **Buyer:**
    - Assume the [risk](../r/risk.md) and responsibility for the goods once they are delivered on board the ship at the destination port.
    - Pay for the unloading of the goods.
    - [Handle](../h/handle.md) [import](../i/import.md) formalities, including customs clearance and [payment](../p/payment.md) of [import](../i/import.md) duties.

## Important Considerations

- **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Transfer**: One of the most critical aspects of DES is the [transfer of risk](../t/transfer_of_risk.md). The [risk](../r/risk.md) transfer happens when the goods are delivered on board the ship at the destination port. From this point forward, any damage or loss of the goods is the buyer's responsibility.
  
- **Unloading Costs**: While the seller covers transportation costs up to the destination port, unloading costs are typically borne by the buyer. This delineation of costs must be clearly understood by both parties to avoid disputes.

- **Documentation**: Proper documentation is essential under DES terms. The seller must provide all necessary documents, including the [bill of lading](../b/bill_of_lading.md), commercial [invoice](../i/invoice.md), packing list, and any certificates required by the buyer. These documents are crucial for the buyer to take possession of the goods and for completing [import](../i/import.md) formalities.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages for the Seller

- **Control over Shipment**: The seller maintains control over the shipment until it reaches the destination port, ensuring that the goods are handled properly and arrive in good condition.
- **Clear [Risk](../r/risk.md) Demarcation**: The [transfer of risk](../t/transfer_of_risk.md) is clearly defined, reducing potential disputes over responsibilities once the goods are delivered on board the ship at the destination port.

### Disadvantages for the Seller

- **Higher Cost**: Since the seller covers transportation costs up to the destination port, the overall cost may be higher compared to other terms where the buyer assumes more responsibility.
- **Complex [Logistics](../l/logistics.md)**: Managing international shipping [logistics](../l/logistics.md) up to the destination port can be complex and requires thorough planning and coordination.

### Advantages for the Buyer

- **Reduced [Risk](../r/risk.md) During Transit**: The buyer is not responsible for the goods during the transit to the destination port, which reduces their [risk](../r/risk.md) exposure and potential liabilities.
- **Simplified [Import](../i/import.md) Process**: With the seller responsible for transportation up to the destination port, the buyer's primary focus is on the [import](../i/import.md) process once the goods arrive.

### Disadvantages for the Buyer

- **Unloading Costs**: The buyer must bear the unloading costs at the destination port, which can sometimes be significant, especially at ports with high handling fees.
- **[Import](../i/import.md) Formalities**: The buyer is responsible for all [import](../i/import.md) formalities, including customs clearance and [payment](../p/payment.md) of [import](../i/import.md) duties, which can be time-consuming and complex.

## Practical Use Cases

### Manufacturing Industry

In the [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) [industry](../i/industry.md), companies often source [raw materials](../r/raw_materials.md) or components from international suppliers. Using DES terms can streamline the [procurement](../p/procurement.md) process, as the supplier assumes responsibility for delivering the goods to the designated port. This allows the purchasing company to focus on production without worrying about transportation [logistics](../l/logistics.md).

### Automotive Sector

Automotive manufacturers frequently [import](../i/import.md) parts and components from various countries. By using DES terms, the manufacturers can reduce their logistical burden and concentrate on the assembly process. The clear delineation of responsibilities also helps in managing [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md) risks more effectively.

### Retail Industry

Large retail chains that [import](../i/import.md) products for resale may use DES terms to ensure smooth delivery of goods to their [distribution](../d/distribution.md) centers. This reduces the retailer's [risk](../r/risk.md) exposure during transit and simplifies the [logistics](../l/logistics.md) management, allowing them to focus on [inventory management](../i/inventory_management.md) and sales.

## Conclusion

Delivered Ex Ship (DES) is a valuable Incoterm for international [trade](../t/trade.md), providing a clear framework for the responsibilities and risks associated with shipping and delivery. By understanding the nuances of DES, both sellers and buyers can minimize disputes, streamline their [logistics](../l/logistics.md) processes, and focus on their core [business activities](../b/business_activities.md). Proper implementation of DES terms requires thorough planning, clear communication, and meticulous documentation to ensure a smooth and efficient [transaction](../t/transaction.md).

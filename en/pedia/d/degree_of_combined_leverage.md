# Degree of Combined Leverage

The Degree of Combined [Leverage](../l/leverage.md) (DCL) is a financial metric that evaluates the sensitivity of a company's [earnings](../e/earnings.md) before [interest](../i/interest.md) and tax (EBIT) to the changes in sales, which demonstrates the impact of both operating and financial [leverage](../l/leverage.md). Essentially, it provides a comprehensive measure of [leverage](../l/leverage.md) by combining [operating leverage](../o/operating_leverage.md) (DOL) and financial [leverage](../l/leverage.md) (DFL).

## Understanding Leverage

[Leverage](../l/leverage.md) in [finance](../f/finance.md) refers to the use of various financial instruments or borrowed [capital](../c/capital.md)—like [debt](../d/debt.md)—to increase the potential [return](../r/return.md) on investment. There are two primary types of [leverage](../l/leverage.md): 
1. **[Operating Leverage](../o/operating_leverage.md)**: This refers to the extent to which a company uses fixed costs in its operations. A company with high [operating leverage](../o/operating_leverage.md) [will](../w/will.md) see a significant change in EBIT with small changes in sales because its fixed costs are relatively large.
2. **Financial [Leverage](../l/leverage.md)**: This pertains to the use of [debt](../d/debt.md) in the company's [capital structure](../c/capital_structure.md). Companies with high financial [leverage](../l/leverage.md) have high levels of [debt](../d/debt.md) and thus high-[interest](../i/interest.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md). Changes in EBIT [will](../w/will.md) cause larger changes in net [income](../i/income.md) due to the [fixed cost](../f/fixed_cost.md) of [interest](../i/interest.md).

## Calculating Degree of Combined Leverage

The formula for the DCL:

\[ \text{DCL} = \frac{\% \text{Change in EPS}}{\% \text{Change in Sales}} \]

Or alternatively:

\[ \text{DCL} = \text{DOL} \times \text{DFL} \]

Where:
- **DOL ([Degree of Operating Leverage](../d/degree_of_operating_leverage.md))**: Measures the [percentage change](../p/percentage_change.md) in EBIT for a given [percentage change](../p/percentage_change.md) in sales.
- **DFL (Degree of Financial [Leverage](../l/leverage.md))**: Measures the [percentage change](../p/percentage_change.md) in net [income](../i/income.md) for a given [percentage change](../p/percentage_change.md) in EBIT.

### Detailed Formula Breakdown

1. **[Degree of Operating Leverage](../d/degree_of_operating_leverage.md) (DOL)**:
\[ \text{DOL} = \frac{\% \text{Change in EBIT}}{\% \text{Change in Sales}} \]
\[ \text{DOL} = \frac{\text{Sales} - \text{Variable Costs}}{\text{Sales} - \text{Variable Costs} - \text{Fixed Costs}} \]

2. **Degree of Financial [Leverage](../l/leverage.md) (DFL)**:
\[ \text{DFL} = \frac{\% \text{Change in Net [Income](../i/income.md)}}{\% \text{Change in EBIT}} \]
\[ \text{DFL} = \frac{\text{EBIT}}{\text{EBIT} - \text{[Interest](../i/interest.md) Expenses}} \]

Combining DOL and DFL gives the Degree of Combined [Leverage](../l/leverage.md):

\[ \text{DCL} = \text{DOL} \times \text{DFL} \]
\[ \text{DCL} = \left( \frac{\text{Sales} - \text{Variable Costs}}{\text{Sales} - \text{Variable Costs} - \text{Fixed Costs}} \right) \times \left( \frac{\text{EBIT}}{\text{EBIT} - \text{[Interest](../i/interest.md) Expenses}} \right) \]

## Practical Implications

### Significance for Investors

For investors, understanding the DCL of a company offers deeper insights into how various levels of sales [will](../w/will.md) impact [earnings](../e/earnings.md):

- **Higher DCL**: Indicates that the company’s [earnings](../e/earnings.md) are more volatile and sensitive to changes in sales. This is typically seen in companies with high fixed costs and significant [debt](../d/debt.md) levels, potentially increasing [financial risk](../f/financial_risk.md) but also the potential for higher returns.
- **Lower DCL**: Demonstrates that the company has lesser sensitivity to change in sales, implying more stable [earnings](../e/earnings.md). Such companies may have lower fixed costs and [debt](../d/debt.md) levels, suggesting lower [financial risk](../f/financial_risk.md) and generally lower returns.

### Business Strategy

Corporations must carefully balance their operating and financial [leverage](../l/leverage.md):
- **High [Operating Leverage](../o/operating_leverage.md)**: May be beneficial during periods of stable or increasing sales as it magnifies [earnings](../e/earnings.md). It, however, can be risky during downturns.
- **High Financial [Leverage](../l/leverage.md)**: Can amplify returns on [equity](../e/equity.md) but at the cost of increased [financial risk](../f/financial_risk.md) and potential [insolvency](../i/insolvency.md) during low [earnings](../e/earnings.md) periods.

### Practical Example

Consider a company XYZ with the following details:
- Fixed Costs: $100,000
- Variable Costs per unit: $20
- Sales price per unit: $50
- Units Sold: 10,000
- [Interest](../i/interest.md) Expenses: $30,000

Calculate DOL and DFL:
- **[Contribution Margin](../c/contribution_margin.md) per Unit**: $50 - $20 = $30
- **Total [Contribution Margin](../c/contribution_margin.md)**: 10,000 units * $30 = $300,000
- **[Operating Income](../o/operating_income.md) (EBIT)**: $300,000 - $100,000 = $200,000

\[ \text{DOL} = \frac{\text{Total [Contribution Margin](../c/contribution_margin.md)}}{\text{Total [Contribution Margin](../c/contribution_margin.md)} - \text{Fixed Costs}} = \frac{300,000}{300,000 - 100,000} = \frac{300,000}{200,000} = 1.5 \]

\[ \text{DFL} = \frac{\text{EBIT}}{\text{EBIT} - \text{[Interest](../i/interest.md) Expenses}} = \frac{200,000}{200,000 - 30,000} = \frac{200,000}{170,000} \approx 1.176 \]

\[ \text{DCL} = \text{DOL} \times \text{DFL} = 1.5 \times 1.176 \approx 1.764 \]

This means that for every 1% change in sales, the EPS of XYZ is expected to change by approximately 1.764%.

## Conclusion

The Degree of Combined [Leverage](../l/leverage.md) is a vital metric for understanding a company’s [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and [risk](../r/risk.md) profile. By analyzing DCL, investors and management can make more informed decisions about the engineering of their cost structures and [capital](../c/capital.md) to navigate the volatile nature of [business](../b/business.md) environments. As such, it is an integral part of [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md), [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), and strategic planning within [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md).

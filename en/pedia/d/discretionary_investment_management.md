# Discretionary Investment Management

Discretionary [investment management](../i/investment_management.md) is a form of [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md) and [asset management](../a/asset_management.md) where an [investment manager](../i/investment_manager.md), such as a [wealth](../w/wealth.md) manager, financial adviser, or a [portfolio manager](../p/portfolio_manager.md), is given the authority to make investment decisions on behalf of a client. This authority allows the manager to execute trading decisions, rebalance portfolios, and allocate assets without requiring prior consent from the client for each [transaction](../t/transaction.md). This document provides an in-depth look at discretionary [investment management](../i/investment_management.md), its benefits, and the associated risks.

## What is Discretionary Investment Management?

Discretionary [investment management](../i/investment_management.md) involves a contractual agreement between an [investor](../i/investor.md) and a [portfolio manager](../p/portfolio_manager.md) or management [firm](../f/firm.md). The key characteristic of this arrangement is the manager's authority to make investment decisions independently, aligned with the client's investment objectives, [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md), and financial goals. These decisions can encompass buying and selling securities, altering [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md), and selecting specific investment vehicles.

### How It Works

1. **Agreement Setup:** The process begins with the establishment of a discretionary management agreement between the client and the [investment manager](../i/investment_manager.md). This agreement outlines the [scope](../s/scope.md) of the manager's authority, investment objectives, [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md), and any specific restrictions or guidelines set by the client.

2. **Portfolio Construction:** The [investment manager](../i/investment_manager.md) constructs a diversified portfolio that aligns with the agreed-upon [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md). This can include a mix of [asset](../a/asset.md) classes such as equities, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs ([Exchange](../e/exchange.md)-Traded Funds), and alternative investments.

3. **Ongoing Management:** The manager actively monitors the portfolio's performance and makes adjustments as necessary to respond to [market](../m/market.md) conditions, economic changes, and the client's evolving financial goals. This might involve [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) the portfolio, executing trades, and updating investment strategies.

4. **Reporting:** Regular reporting is provided to the client to ensure [transparency](../t/transparency.md). This includes performance reports, [transaction](../t/transaction.md) summaries, and the overall health of the investment portfolio.

## Benefits of Discretionary Investment Management

Discretionary [investment management](../i/investment_management.md) offers several advantages, particularly for clients who prefer a hands-off approach to [investing](../i/investing.md) or those who lack the time and expertise to manage their portfolios efficiently.

### Professional Expertise

Investment managers possess significant expertise and experience in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). They employ advanced analytical tools, research capabilities, and [market](../m/market.md) insights to make informed investment decisions that align with the client's objectives.

### Time Efficiency

Clients can save a substantial amount of time by delegating investment decisions to professional managers. Instead of monitoring the [market](../m/market.md) and making frequent decisions, clients can focus on other personal or professional activities.

### Diversification

Discretionary managers often have access to a wide [range](../r/range.md) of investment products and opportunities that may not be readily available to individual investors. This enables them to build diversified portfolios that can potentially enhance returns while mitigating risks.

### Risk Management

Professional managers are adept at assessing and managing [risk](../r/risk.md). They can implement strategies to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md), safeguard against losses, and ensure that the client's [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) is adhered to throughout the investment process.

### Customization

Discretionary [investment management](../i/investment_management.md) allows for personalized investment strategies that cater to the specific needs and goals of the client. Unlike mass-[market](../m/market.md) investment products, discretionary portfolios can be tailored to address individual financial circumstances, tax situations, and investment preferences.

### Responsiveness to Market Changes

Since investment managers have the authority to make decisions independently, they can quickly respond to [market](../m/market.md) fluctuations and economic developments. This agility can be crucial in capturing investment opportunities and mitigating potential losses.

## Risks of Discretionary Investment Management

While discretionary [investment management](../i/investment_management.md) offers numerous benefits, it is not without its risks. These risks need to be carefully considered by potential clients before entering into a discretionary management agreement.

### Loss of Control

One of the primary concerns with discretionary management is the loss of direct control over investment decisions. Clients must rely on the manager's [judgment](../j/judgment.md) and expertise, which may not always align perfectly with their own perspectives or preferences.

### Performance Risk

There is no guarantee of investment performance, and discretionary managers, like all investors, are subject to [market](../m/market.md) risks. A manager's decisions, even when informed by extensive research and analysis, may not always result in positive returns. Clients must be prepared for the possibility of underperformance or financial loss.

### Management Fees

Discretionary [investment management](../i/investment_management.md) typically involves management fees, which are charged for the professional services provided. These fees can vary based on the complexity of the [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md), the amount of assets under management, and the specific terms of the agreement. It is important for clients to understand the [fee](../f/fee.md) structure and assess its impact on overall returns.

### Conflicts of Interest

Potential conflicts of [interest](../i/interest.md) may arise if the [investment manager](../i/investment_manager.md)'s interests do not perfectly align with those of the client. For instance, managers may be incentivized to favor certain investment products or strategies that benefit their [firm](../f/firm.md). Transparent communication and a clear understanding of the manager's compensation and incentives are essential.

### Regulatory and Compliance Risks

Investment managers are subject to regulatory oversight to ensure that they adhere to [industry](../i/industry.md) standards and protect clients' interests. However, regulatory changes or compliance lapses can pose risks. Clients should work with reputable and compliant managers to mitigate these risks.

### Market and Economic Risks

Discretionary [investment management](../i/investment_management.md) does not eliminate [market](../m/market.md) and economic risks. Economic downturns, geopolitical events, and [global market volatility](../g/global_market_volatility.md) can affect [portfolio performance](../p/portfolio_performance.md) irrespective of the manager's expertise. [Diversification](../d/diversification.md) and prudent [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) strategies are essential in mitigating these risks.

## Conclusion

Discretionary [investment management](../i/investment_management.md) provides a structured and professional approach to [investing](../i/investing.md), [offering](../o/offering.md) significant benefits such as expertise, time [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md), [diversification](../d/diversification.md), and responsive [risk management](../r/risk_management.md). However, it also poses risks, including loss of control, performance [variability](../v/variability.md), management fees, conflicts of [interest](../i/interest.md), and exposure to [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md).

Clients considering discretionary [investment management](../i/investment_management.md) should comprehensively evaluate their financial goals, [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md), and the reputation and expertise of potential managers. By understanding both the benefits and risks, clients can make informed decisions that align with their long-term financial aspirations, ensuring a balanced and strategic approach to [wealth management](../w/wealth_management.md).

# Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE)

The Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE) is the principal stock exchange in Tanzania, located in the city of Dar es Salaam. Established in 1996, it was created to facilitate the mobilization of financial resources and to promote economic development in the country by enabling the trading of stocks and bonds. The DSE is regulated by the Capital Markets and Securities Authority (CMSA), which ensures that the exchange operates in a fair and transparent manner.

## History and Establishment

The idea of establishing a stock exchange in Tanzania can be traced back to the early 1990s when the Tanzanian government began implementing economic reforms aimed at transitioning from a centrally planned economy to a market-oriented economy. These reforms included the privatization of state-owned enterprises and the liberalization of financial markets.

The DSE was formally registered on September 19, 1996, and started operations on April 15, 1998. The first company to be listed on the DSE was Tanzania Oxygen Limited (TOL), now known as TOL Gases Limited.

These reforms included the [privatization](../p/privatization.md) of state-owned enterprises and the liberalization of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

The DSE was formally registered on September 19, 1996, and started operations on April 15, 1998. The first company to be [listed](../l/listed.md) on the DSE was Tanzania Oxygen Limited (TOL), now known as TOL Gases Limited.

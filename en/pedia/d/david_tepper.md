# David Tepper

## Early Life and Education

David Alan Tepper was born on September 11, 1957, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Raised in a modest Jewish family, his father, Harry Tepper, was an accountant, whereas his mother, Roberta, was a school teacher. Tepper exhibited a strong affinity for numbers from an early age, a talent that would serve him well in the financial world.

Tepper attended Peabody High School in Pittsburgh. After high school, he enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh, where he earned his Bachelor’s degree in Economics in 1978. Notably, Tepper worked his way through college, demonstrating an early aptitude for balancing multiple demands and handling financial responsibilities. Following his undergraduate studies, Tepper pursued a Master of Science in Industrial Administration (MSIA) from Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business, which now bears his name due to substantial donations he has made over the years.

## Early Career

David Tepper began his career at Equibank as a credit analyst. His responsibilities included analyzing the creditworthiness of various companies and understanding their debt structures. This role provided Tepper with valuable experience and insight into the financial health of corporations, knowledge that would later prove critical in his investment strategies.

In 1985, Tepper transitioned to Republic Steel, followed by a position at Keystone Mutual Funds. However, it was his tenure at Goldman Sachs that significantly shaped his career. Joining Goldman Sachs in 1985 as a credit analyst, he quickly ascended to the head of the high-yield trading desk. Tepper was instrumental in trading distressed securities, particularly during the tumultuous period following the 1987 market crash. This experience at Goldman Sachs honed his skills in trading distressed debt, a niche that would become the cornerstone of his future successes.

## Founding Appaloosa Management

In 1993, Tepper left Goldman Sachs to co-found Appaloosa Management with Jack Walton. Appaloosa Management is a hedge fund management firm headquartered in Short Hills, New Jersey. It specializes in distressed debt, a sector where Tepper had already established a formidable reputation.

Appaloosa Management’s strategy focuses on deep value investing, where they buy securities that are trading significantly below intrinsic value. The firm often takes large positions in distressed companies, betting on their turnaround or improved market conditions. Tepper's approach often involves significant risk, but it has also led to substantial rewards.

## Investing in Debt

Distressed debt investing involves purchasing the debt of companies that are experiencing financial or operational difficulties. These securities typically trade at a significant discount to their face value, reflecting the higher risk associated with such investments. However, there is also potential for substantial returns if the company recovers or successfully restructures its obligations.

### Strategic Approach

Tepper’s investment strategy involves a deep understanding of the companies in which he invests. He meticulously analyzes the financial health, assets, and restructuring potential of distressed companies. By purchasing distressed debt at discounted prices, Tepper positions Appaloosa Management to benefit from any recovery in the companies’ financial conditions.

### Notable Investments

1. **2002 - Enron and WorldCom**: After the collapse of Enron in 2001 and WorldCom in 2002 due to accounting scandals, Tepper purchased their distressed debt. His bets paid off significantly as both companies restructured and emerged from bankruptcy.

2. **2009 - Financial Crisis**: One of Tepper’s most famous bets was during the 2009 financial crisis. He invested heavily in the distressed debt of large banks like Bank of America and Citigroup, among others. As the U.S. government intervened to stabilize the banking sector, the value of these distressed debts soared, leading to massive profits for Appaloosa Management. Tepper’s adept handling of financial institutions during this period cemented his reputation as a master of distressed debt investing.

3. **2012 - European Debt Crisis**: Tepper also capitalized on the European debt crisis by investing in distressed European sovereign debt and banking stocks, again reaping significant returns as the European Central Bank took measures to stabilize the economy.

### Risk and Reward

Distressed debt investing is inherently risky. The companies involved are often on the brink of bankruptcy, and their securities are volatile. However, the potential returns can be substantial. Tepper’s success lies in his ability to assess the real value of distressed assets accurately and his willingness to take calculated risks.

## Philanthropy

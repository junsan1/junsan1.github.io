# Dogs of the Dow

The "Dogs of the Dow" is a well-known [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) that revolves around selecting the highest [dividend](../d/dividend.md)-yielding [stocks](../s/stock.md) from the list of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). This approach aims to take advantage of the cyclical nature of high-[yield](../y/yield.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) and their potential for [capital](../c/capital.md) appreciation as they revert to mean valuations over time. The strategy, while simple in its conception, has garnered a significant following and has spurred a variety of analytical approaches, adaptations, and discussions within the investment community.

## History and Background

The Dogs of the Dow strategy was popularized by Michael B. O'Higgins in his 1991 book, "Beating the Dow." The premise is grounded in the belief that large, well-established companies in the Dow are unlikely to experience long-term declines and that high [dividend](../d/dividend.md) yields often indicate [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) or out-of-favor [stocks](../s/stock.md) poised for recovery.

The theory suggests that by annually picking the top ten high-yielding Dow [stocks](../s/stock.md), investors can potentially [outperform](../o/outperform.md) the overall [market](../m/market.md). The rationale is twofold: the high [dividend yield](../d/dividend_yield.md) provides a steady stream of [income](../i/income.md), and the relatively low stock price (that causes the [yield](../y/yield.md) to be high) might recover, thus providing [capital gain](../c/capital_gain.md).

## The Mechanics of the Strategy

### 1. Identifying the Dogs
At the end of the year, an [investor](../i/investor.md) screens the 30 [stocks](../s/stock.md) in the Dow Jones Industrial Average to find the ten [stocks](../s/stock.md) with the highest [dividend](../d/dividend.md) yields. The [dividend yield](../d/dividend_yield.md) is calculated by dividing the annual [dividend](../d/dividend.md) per share by the stock's price per share.

### 2. Equal Allocation
The [investor](../i/investor.md) then equally allocates their investment across these ten [stocks](../s/stock.md). This equal allocation ensures that the [investor](../i/investor.md) isn't disproportionately exposed to any single stock or sector, helping to diversify [risk](../r/risk.md).

### 3. Annual Rebalancing
At the end of each subsequent year, the process is repeated. The portfolio is rebalanced to once again [hold](../h/hold.md) the new list of the top ten highest [dividend](../d/dividend.md)-yielding Dow [stocks](../s/stock.md).

## Financial Rationale

### Dividends as Indicators
High [dividend](../d/dividend.md) yields can often indicate [stocks](../s/stock.md) that are temporarily [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md). Investors are paid to wait through dividends until the [market](../m/market.md) recognizes the [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) of the company. Historically, dividends have also been a significant component of [total return](../t/total_return.md) in the [stock market](../s/stock_market.md), providing steady [income](../i/income.md) regardless of stock price [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

### Mean Reversion
One of the core pillars of the Dogs of the Dow strategy is the concept of [mean reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md). This theory posits that high-[yield](../y/yield.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md), more often than not, are priced lower due to temporary issues that are inherently fixable or overestimated by the [market](../m/market.md). Over time, these prices correct, and the yields come back to an average level as the stock price appreciates.

## Adaptations and Variations

The simplicity and historical effectiveness of the Dogs of the Dow strategy have led to several adaptations:

### Small Dogs of the Dow
This variation involves picking only the five lowest-priced highest-yielding [stocks](../s/stock.md) from the original ten. The idea is that lower price [stocks](../s/stock.md) have higher potential for significant gains, albeit with higher [risk](../r/risk.md).

### International Dogs
Applying the same principle to other global markets, investors can seek the highest [dividend](../d/dividend.md)-yielding [stocks](../s/stock.md) in indices outside the U.S., such as the FTSE 100 or [Nikkei](../n/nikkei.md) 225.

### Dividend Aristocrats
Some investors choose to focus on high-[yield](../y/yield.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) that also have a history of increasing dividends, applying the Dogs strategy within a subset of companies known for reliable [dividend](../d/dividend.md) growth.

## Performance and Criticisms

### Historical Performance
Over various time periods, the Dogs of the Dow strategy has generally performed well against the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Its focus on dividends has provided a cushion during bear markets, and the principle of buying [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) has led to significant [capital](../c/capital.md) appreciation in [bull](../b/bull.md) markets.

### Criticisms
1. **Sector Concentration**: At times, high-[yield](../y/yield.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) can be concentrated in specific sectors facing broad challenges, leading to overexposure to particular industries.
2. **[Value Trap](../v/value_trap.md)**: [Stocks](../s/stock.md) with high yields due to plunging prices might be in long-term decline rather than temporary setbacks, leading to potential underperformance.
3. **Simplistic Approach**: Some critics argue the strategy is overly simplistic and doesnâ€™t account for broader [market](../m/market.md) conditions, company fundamentals, or macroeconomic factors.

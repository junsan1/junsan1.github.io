# Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number

A DUNS (Data Universal Numbering System) Number is a unique nine-digit identifier for businesses, created by Dun & Bradstreet (D&B). This identifier is used globally to identify and access information on businesses. Companies across the world use DUNS Numbers to identify their business entities uniquely, which facilitates the management of business credit, the improvement of data management, and the enhancement of global trade.

## Origin and Purpose of DUNS Number

The DUNS Number was introduced in 1963 by Dun & Bradstreet, an American company that specializes in providing commercial data, analytics, and insights for businesses. Dun & Bradstreet is a pioneer in the concept of Data Universal Numbering, which helps companies keep track of business entities and their hierarchies.

The primary purpose of a DUNS Number is to act as a unique identifier for a business entity. It helps to:

- Establish a business credit file.
- Identify a company's corporate family tree.
- Assess business creditworthiness.
- Track financial transactions in compliance with various regulations.

Business entities of all sizes, from small startups to global conglomerates, may obtain a DUNS Number to facilitate better data management and foster trust in their financial dealings.

## How the DUNS Number Works

A DUNS Number consists of nine digits, which do not carry any apparent meaning or classification and are solely meant for unique identification within the database. This number does not change over time and is not reused; thus, it stays with the business location it is assigned regardless of movement or other changes.

### Steps to Obtain a DUNS Number

Obtaining a DUNS Number is a relatively straightforward process:

1. **Application Submission**: Businesses need to submit an application, typically through the D&B website.
2. **Data Verification**: Dun & Bradstreet verifies the business information provided.
3. **Generation**: A unique nine-digit DUNS Number is generated and issued to the business.

The process can be completed in a matter of days, though expedited processing is available for those requiring a number urgently.

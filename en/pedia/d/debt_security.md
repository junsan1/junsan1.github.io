# Debt Security

A **[debt](../d/debt.md) [security](../s/security.md)** is a [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) that represents a [loan](../l/loan.md) made by an [investor](../i/investor.md) to a borrower. [Debt](../d/debt.md) securities are typically issued by entities such as corporations, governments, or municipalities to raise [capital](../c/capital.md). They come with specific terms including the amount borrowed, the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md), the [maturity date](../m/maturity_date.md), and the [repayment](../r/repayment.md) schedule.

## Types of Debt Securities

### Bonds

Bonds are the most common type of [debt](../d/debt.md) [security](../s/security.md). They are essentially loans made by investors to issuers, which can [range](../r/range.md) from governments to corporations. The [issuer](../i/issuer.md) agrees to pay back the [principal](../p/principal.md) amount (the [face value](../f/face_value.md)) at a specified future date (the [maturity date](../m/maturity_date.md)), along with periodic [interest](../i/interest.md) payments (coupons).

- **Government Bonds:** Bonds issued by national governments. These are considered low-[risk](../r/risk.md) investments.
- **[Municipal Bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md):** Bonds issued by local governments or municipalities. Often used to [finance](../f/finance.md) public projects.
- **Corporate Bonds:** Bonds issued by corporations. They typically [offer](../o/offer.md) higher yields compared to government bonds but come with higher [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Notes

Notes are similar to bonds but typically have shorter maturities. They can be issued by governments, municipalities, or corporations. Notes are often used to raise funds for medium-term financial needs.

### Debentures

A [debenture](../d/debenture.md) is an [unsecured debt](../u/unsecured_debt.md) [security](../s/security.md), meaning it is not backed by any specific assets. Instead, it is backed by the general [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) and reputation of the [issuer](../i/issuer.md).

### Asset-Backed Securities (ABS)

ABS are [debt](../d/debt.md) securities backed by financial assets such as loans, leases, or receivables. These [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets generate [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md), which is used to pay back the investors.

- **[Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-Backed Securities (MBS):** A type of ABS backed by a collection of [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) loans.
- **Collateralized [Debt](../d/debt.md) [Obligations](../o/obligation.md) (CDO):** ABS that pool various types of [debt](../d/debt.md), including bonds and loans.

### Certificates of Deposit (CDs)

CDs are time deposits offered by banks that pay a [fixed interest rate](../f/fixed_interest_rate.md) for a specified term. They are considered low-[risk](../r/risk.md) investments as they are typically insured by the government.

## Features of Debt Securities

[Debt](../d/debt.md) securities come with certain inherent features that make them attractive investment [options](../o/options.md):

### Interest Rate (Coupon)

The [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md), or coupon, is the periodic [payment](../p/payment.md) made to the [investor](../i/investor.md). It can be fixed or variable. Fixed-rate securities [offer](../o/offer.md) predictable [income](../i/income.md), while variable-rate securities adjust the [interest](../i/interest.md) payments based on [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

### Maturity Date

The [maturity date](../m/maturity_date.md) is when the [principal](../p/principal.md) amount of the [debt](../d/debt.md) [security](../s/security.md) is due to be paid back in full. Maturities can [range](../r/range.md) from short-term (less than one year) to long-term (more than ten years).

### Credit Rating

[Credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) agencies assign ratings to [debt](../d/debt.md) securities based on the [issuer](../i/issuer.md)'s [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md). Higher-rated securities are considered safer but [offer](../o/offer.md) lower yields, whereas lower-rated securities come with higher [risk](../r/risk.md) and higher yields.

## Advantages of Debt Securities

### Stable Income

[Debt](../d/debt.md) securities provide a steady stream of [income](../i/income.md) through [interest](../i/interest.md) payments, making them a popular choice for [income](../i/income.md)-focused investors.

### Lower Risk

Compared to equities, [debt](../d/debt.md) securities are generally considered lower [risk](../r/risk.md), especially those issued by reputable issuers.

### Diversification

[Debt](../d/debt.md) securities can [offer](../o/offer.md) [diversification benefits](../d/diversification_benefits.md) to an investment portfolio, reducing overall [risk](../r/risk.md).

## Risks Associated with Debt Securities

### Credit Risk

The [risk](../r/risk.md) that the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) [will](../w/will.md) [default](../d/default.md) on their [payment](../p/payment.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md). This [risk](../r/risk.md) is higher in securities issued by corporations with lower [credit](../c/credit.md) ratings.

### Interest Rate Risk

The [risk](../r/risk.md) that the [value](../v/value.md) of the [debt](../d/debt.md) [security](../s/security.md) [will](../w/will.md) decrease due to rising [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. This affects fixed-rate securities more than variable-rate ones.

### Inflation Risk

The [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) of the [interest](../i/interest.md) payments and [principal](../p/principal.md) may decrease due to [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

### Liquidity Risk

Some [debt](../d/debt.md) securities may be difficult to buy or sell quickly without affecting their price.

## Regulatory Aspects

[Debt](../d/debt.md) securities are subject to stringent regulatory frameworks imposed by financial authorities. For instance, in the U.S., the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) regulates the issuance and trading of [debt](../d/debt.md) securities.

### SEC Regulation

The SEC requires issuers to provide comprehensive information about the [debt](../d/debt.md) [security](../s/security.md) and their [financial health](../f/financial_health.md), ensuring [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and protecting investors.

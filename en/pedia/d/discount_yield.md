# Discount Yield

[Discount](../d/discount.md) [yield](../y/yield.md), also known as [discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md) or [yield](../y/yield.md) [discount](../d/discount.md), is a financial term used to describe the [return](../r/return.md) on investment for a [bond](../b/bond.md) or Treasury bill sold at a [discount](../d/discount.md) to its [face value](../f/face_value.md). It represents the annualized percentage [discount](../d/discount.md) from the instrument's [par value](../p/par_value.md) to its purchase price, thereby giving investors an idea of the [effective yield](../e/effective_yield.md) they can expect over the period until [maturity](../m/maturity.md). [Discount](../d/discount.md) [yield](../y/yield.md) is particularly useful for zero-coupon bonds, Treasury bills, and other [short-term debt](../s/short-term_debt.md) instruments that do not pay periodic [interest](../i/interest.md) (coupons) but are instead sold at a [discount](../d/discount.md) and redeemed at [face value](../f/face_value.md) on [maturity](../m/maturity.md).

## Calculation of Discount Yield

The formula for [discount](../d/discount.md) [yield](../y/yield.md) is straightforward and can be expressed as follows:

\[ \text{Discount Yield} = \left( \frac{\text{[Face Value](../f/face_value.md)} - \text{Purchase Price}}{\text{[Face Value](../f/face_value.md)}} \right) \times \left( \frac{360}{\text{Days to [Maturity](../m/maturity.md)}} \right) \]

Here’s what each of the components means:

- **[Face Value](../f/face_value.md)**: The [nominal](../n/nominal.md) or [par value](../p/par_value.md) of the [bond](../b/bond.md) or Treasury bill.
- **Purchase Price**: The price at which the [bond](../b/bond.md) or Treasury bill was initially purchased.
- **Days to [Maturity](../m/maturity.md)**: The number of days remaining until the [bond](../b/bond.md) or Treasury bill matures.

### Example Calculation

Suppose an [investor](../i/investor.md) buys a Treasury bill with a [face value](../f/face_value.md) of $10,000 for a purchase price of $9,800, and the T-bill matures in 180 days. Using the [discount](../d/discount.md) [yield](../y/yield.md) formula:

\[ \text{[Discount](../d/discount.md) [Yield](../y/yield.md)} = \left( \frac{10,000 - 9,800}{10,000} \right) \times \left( \frac{360}{180} \right) \]

\[ \text{[Discount](../d/discount.md) [Yield](../y/yield.md)} = 0.02 \times 2 = 0.04 \text{ or } 4\% \]

This means the annualized [discount](../d/discount.md) [yield](../y/yield.md) for this Treasury bill is 4%.

## Importance in Financial Markets

[Discount](../d/discount.md) [yield](../y/yield.md) is a critical metric in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) for several reasons:

1. **[Valuation](../v/valuation.md) of Short-Term Instruments**: Investors use [discount](../d/discount.md) [yield](../y/yield.md) to compare the returns on various short-term financial instruments like Treasury bills, [commercial paper](../c/commercial_paper.md), and certificates of [deposit](../d/deposit.md).
2. **Benchmarking and [Monetary Policy](../m/monetary_policy.md)**: Central banks, such as the Federal Reserve in the U.S., monitor and influence short-term [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, often using [discount](../d/discount.md) [yield](../y/yield.md) as a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) to set [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md).
3. **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Assessment**: [Discount](../d/discount.md) [yield](../y/yield.md) helps in assessing the [risk](../r/risk.md) of [short-term investments](../s/short-term_investments.md). Generally, higher [discount](../d/discount.md) yields are associated with higher [risk](../r/risk.md) levels.
4. **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) Management**: For businesses and financial institutions, managing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) efficiently involves [investing](../i/investing.md) in short-term instruments with favorable [discount](../d/discount.md) yields to meet their short-term [obligations](../o/obligation.md).

## Discount Yield vs. Other Yield Metrics

There are several other [yield](../y/yield.md) metrics used in [bond](../b/bond.md) markets, including:

- **[Current Yield](../c/current_yield.md)**: This is calculated by dividing the annual coupon [payment](../p/payment.md) by the current [market price](../m/market_price.md) of the [bond](../b/bond.md).
- **[Yield to Maturity](../y/yield_to_maturity.md) (YTM)**: This represents the [total return](../t/total_return.md) anticipated on a [bond](../b/bond.md) if held until it matures, factoring in all coupon payments and the difference between the purchase price and the [face value](../f/face_value.md).

While [discount](../d/discount.md) [yield](../y/yield.md) is primarily used for zero-coupon instruments, [current yield](../c/current_yield.md) and YTM are more commonly applied to coupon-paying bonds.

## Applications in Different Securities

### Treasury Bills

Treasury bills are the most well-known instruments that use [discount](../d/discount.md) [yield](../y/yield.md) for their [valuation](../v/valuation.md). Sold in weekly auctions by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, these are short-term securities maturing in a few days up to one year. The application of [discount](../d/discount.md) [yield](../y/yield.md) in Treasury bills helps investors determine the effective [return](../r/return.md) they [will](../w/will.md) receive for holding the bill until [maturity](../m/maturity.md).

### Zero-Coupon Bonds

Zero-coupon bonds do not provide periodic [interest](../i/interest.md) payments but are sold at a substantial [discount](../d/discount.md) to their [face value](../f/face_value.md). The primary [yield](../y/yield.md) metric for these bonds is the [discount](../d/discount.md) [yield](../y/yield.md). This [yield](../y/yield.md) calculation allows investors to understand the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s profitability over its entire term.

### Commercial Paper

Corporations [issue](../i/issue.md) [commercial paper](../c/commercial_paper.md) as a short-term funding option, mainly to manage their short-term liabilities. These are typically issued at a [discount](../d/discount.md) from [face value](../f/face_value.md), and the [discount](../d/discount.md) [yield](../y/yield.md) calculation helps in determining the cost of borrowing.

### Certificates of Deposit (CDs)

Although many CDs pay periodic [interest](../i/interest.md), some are issued at a [discount](../d/discount.md) and do not pay [interest](../i/interest.md) until [maturity](../m/maturity.md). The [discount](../d/discount.md) [yield](../y/yield.md) for these CDs helps investors compare returns against other [short-term investments](../s/short-term_investments.md).

## Real-World Examples and Case Studies

### U.S. Treasury

The U.S. Department of the Treasury regularly issues T-bills that are auctioned to investors. On its official site [www.treasurydirect.gov](https://www.treasurydirect.gov), the [discount](../d/discount.md) [yield](../y/yield.md) for each auction is published, helping investors make decisions based on current [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

### Corporate Issuers

Large corporations like Apple and Microsoft often [issue](../i/issue.md) [commercial paper](../c/commercial_paper.md) as part of their [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) management strategies. The [discount](../d/discount.md) yields for these instruments provide valuable insight into the cost of short-term borrowing for these companies. You can visit Apple’s [Investor Relations](https://investor.apple.com) or Microsoft’s [Investor Relations](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor) for more details.

### Central Banks

Central banks around the world monitor [discount](../d/discount.md) yields as part of their [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) tools. The Federal Reserve, for example, uses data on [discount](../d/discount.md) yields when making decisions about [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and other economic measures. You can find more information on the Federal Reserve’s official site [www.federalreserve.gov](https://www.federalreserve.gov).

## Computational Tools and Techniques

### Bloomberg Terminal

Financial professionals use advanced tools like the [Bloomberg Terminal](../b/bloomberg_terminal.md) to calculate and compare [discount](../d/discount.md) yields among various instruments. The [Bloomberg Terminal](../b/bloomberg_terminal.md) offers real-time data and analytics on fixed-[income](../i/income.md) securities, including [discount](../d/discount.md) [yield](../y/yield.md) calculations.

### Python Libraries

For quantitative analysts and algorithmic traders, Python offers several libraries like Pandas and NumPy that can be used to calculate [discount](../d/discount.md) yields programmatically. Here’s a basic example using Python:

```python
[import](../i/import.md) pandas as pd

def calculate_discount_yield(face_value, purchase_price, days_to_maturity):
    discount_yield = ((face_value - purchase_price) / face_value) * (360 / days_to_maturity)
    [return](../r/return.md) discount_yield

# Example
face_value = 10000
purchase_price = 9800
days_to_maturity = 180

yield_value = calculate_discount_yield(face_value, purchase_price, days_to_maturity)
print(f"[Discount](../d/discount.md) [Yield](../y/yield.md): {yield_value * 100}%")
```

### Excel

Excel remains a popular tool for calculating [discount](../d/discount.md) [yield](../y/yield.md), particularly among retail investors and smaller institutional players. Simple formulas and built-in financial functions can be used to compute exact yields without much hassle.

## Historical Background

Dun & Bradstreet's history dates back to 1841 when Lewis Tappan, a savvy businessman, founded the "Mercantile Agency" in New York City. The objective was to create a network of correspondents who could provide reliable, timely intelligence on the creditworthiness of merchants and traders across the United States. This service addressed a critical need in the expanding American economy, where businesses required trustworthy information to make credit decisions.

Over the years, the Mercantile Agency evolved and merged with other players, eventually becoming known as Dun & Bradstreet in 1933 after merging with R.G. Dun & Company. The company has since grown into a global leader in business information and analytics.

# Debit

## Definition
**Debit** is an [accounting](../a/accounting.md) term that refers to an entry on the left side of a double-entry bookkeeping system. It represents an increase in assets or expenses and a decrease in liabilities, [equity](../e/equity.md), or [revenue](../r/revenue.md). Debits are used to record the consumption of [value](../v/value.md) and the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) of assets.

## Key Components
1. **[Accounting](../a/accounting.md) Entry**: In double-entry bookkeeping, every [transaction](../t/transaction.md) is recorded in two accounts: one debit and one [credit](../c/credit.md).
2. **Assets and Expenses**: Debits increase [asset](../a/asset.md) and [expense](../e/expense.md) accounts.
3. **Liabilities, [Equity](../e/equity.md), and [Revenue](../r/revenue.md)**: Debits decrease [liability](../l/liability.md), [equity](../e/equity.md), and [revenue](../r/revenue.md) accounts.

## Double-Entry Bookkeeping
1. **Debit (Dr)**: An entry made on the left side of an account.
2. **[Credit](../c/credit.md) (Cr)**: An entry made on the right side of an account. Credits increase liabilities, [equity](../e/equity.md), and [revenue](../r/revenue.md) accounts and decrease assets and expenses.

## Importance
1. **Accuracy**: Ensures the accuracy and balance of financial records by recording both aspects of each [transaction](../t/transaction.md).
2. **[Transparency](../t/transparency.md)**: Provides a clear and detailed record of all financial transactions.
3. **Financial Reporting**: Essential for preparing accurate [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md), such as the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) and [income statement](../i/income_statement.md).

## How Debits Work
1. **Assets**: When a [business](../b/business.md) acquires an [asset](../a/asset.md), the [asset](../a/asset.md) account is debited to reflect the increase in assets.
   - Example: Purchasing office equipment for $1,000. The office equipment account is debited by $1,000.
2. **Expenses**: When a [business](../b/business.md) incurs an [expense](../e/expense.md), the [expense](../e/expense.md) account is debited to reflect the increase in expenses.
   - Example: Paying $500 for utilities. The utilities [expense](../e/expense.md) account is debited by $500.
3. **Liabilities**: When a [business](../b/business.md) repays a [liability](../l/liability.md), the [liability](../l/liability.md) account is debited to reflect the decrease in liabilities.
   - Example: Paying off a $2,000 [loan](../l/loan.md). The [loan](../l/loan.md) account is debited by $2,000.
4. **[Equity](../e/equity.md)**: When a [business](../b/business.md) owner withdraws [money](../m/money.md), the [equity](../e/equity.md) account is debited to reflect the decrease in [equity](../e/equity.md).
   - Example: An owner withdraws $1,500. The owner’s [equity](../e/equity.md) account is debited by $1,500.
5. **[Revenue](../r/revenue.md)**: When [revenue](../r/revenue.md) is recorded, it is typically credited; however, if [revenue](../r/revenue.md) is refunded or reversed, it is debited.
   - Example: Issuing a $300 refund to a [customer](../c/customer.md). The sales [revenue](../r/revenue.md) account is debited by $300.

## Example Scenarios
1. **[Bank](../b/bank.md) Transactions**: When a [customer](../c/customer.md) uses a debit card to make a purchase, their [bank](../b/bank.md) account is debited by the purchase amount.
   - Example: A [customer](../c/customer.md) buys groceries for $100 using a debit card. The [customer](../c/customer.md)’s [bank](../b/bank.md) account is debited by $100.
2. **[Business](../b/business.md) Transactions**: When a company receives supplies and agrees to pay later, the supplies account is debited, and accounts payable is credited.
   - Example: Receiving $500 worth of office supplies on [credit](../c/credit.md). The supplies account is debited by $500, and accounts payable is credited by $500.
3. **[Accounting](../a/accounting.md) Records**: Recording [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) of equipment involves debiting the [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) [expense](../e/expense.md) account.
   - Example: Recording $200 [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) on machinery. The [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) [expense](../e/expense.md) account is debited by $200.

## Debit vs. Credit
1. **Debit**: Increases in assets and expenses; decreases in liabilities, [equity](../e/equity.md), and [revenue](../r/revenue.md).
2. **[Credit](../c/credit.md)**: Increases in liabilities, [equity](../e/equity.md), and [revenue](../r/revenue.md); decreases in assets and expenses.

## Conclusion
Debits are a fundamental component of double-entry bookkeeping, ensuring the accuracy and completeness of financial records. Understanding how debits work and how they interact with credits is essential for maintaining balanced accounts and producing accurate [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md). Debits play a crucial role in tracking the [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and performance of a [business](../b/business.md).

# Downstream

The term "downstream" refers to the later stages in the production and [distribution](../d/distribution.md) processes of various industries, particularly the oil and gas sector. In these industries, operations can broadly be categorized into three segments: [upstream](../u/upstream.md), midstream, and downstream. 

## Definition of Downstream

Downstream operations are concerned with the latter stages of production, which involve the refining of [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md), processing natural gas, [marketing](../m/marketing.md), [distribution](../d/distribution.md), and retailing of end products to consumers. In the context of oil and gas, downstream activities encompass everything from refining [petroleum](../p/petroleum.md) [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md) and processing raw natural gas to the selling and distributing of natural gas and refined products. These activities can include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, plastics, natural gas, as well as other petrochemicals.

Downstream operations are critical because they convert [raw materials](../r/raw_materials.md) extracted [upstream](../u/upstream.md) into finished products that consumers use daily. This sector also has a direct relationship with consumer-facing businesses and largely pertains to the sectors dealing with the delivery and sales of end-[market](../m/market.md) products.

## Types of Downstream Operations

### Refining

One of the pivotal components of downstream operations is refining. Refineries take [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md) and gas that has been extracted [upstream](../u/upstream.md) and transform it into usable products like gasoline, diesel fuel, heating oil, jet fuel, and various petrochemicals. The refining process includes [multiple](../m/multiple.md) steps such as distillation, cracking, reforming, and treating.

### Distribution and Retail

Upon refinement, the next significant component is [distribution](../d/distribution.md) and retail. This involves the transportation of refined products to storage facilities, and then ultimately to consumers. Fuel, for instance, moves through complex networks of pipelines or is transported by ships or trucks to gasoline stations. Retail points include gas stations, both independent and those branded by major oil companies, and other consumer outlets including supermarkets and convenience stores.

### Marketing and Sales

Another important aspect of downstream operations is [marketing](../m/marketing.md) and sales. This includes all activities concerned with the [sale](../s/sale.md) of [petroleum](../p/petroleum.md) products and their [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) to end-users. The [marketing](../m/marketing.md) side of [business](../b/business.md) operations might involve [brand management](../b/brand_management.md), creating [customer](../c/customer.md) outreach strategies, and various promotional activities to enhance sales.

### Petchem (Petrochemicals)

Additionally, the downstream sector includes the [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) of petrochemicals. Petrochemicals are chemical products derived from [petroleum](../p/petroleum.md) through refinery processes. These products include plastics, fertilizers, detergents, synthetic fibers, and rubbers, among others.

## Examples of Downstream Operations

### ExxonMobil

ExxonMobil is one of the largest publicly traded international oil and gas companies, and it is highly integrated across the downstream sectorâ€™s refining, [distribution](../d/distribution.md), and [marketing](../m/marketing.md) activities. You can explore more about their operations [here](https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/).

### Royal Dutch Shell

Shell operates an extensive network of refineries, chemicals, and [distribution](../d/distribution.md) facilities fully integrated with their [upstream](../u/upstream.md) and midstream operations. The company's diverse [range](../r/range.md) of activities in the downstream sector globally make it a key player. More about their operations can be found [here](https://www.shell.com/).

### Chevron

Chevron has significant operations in the downstream sector, including refining, product [marketing](../m/marketing.md), and transportation. Chevron's downstream operations allow the company to [offer](../o/offer.md) consumers a [range](../r/range.md) of [petroleum](../p/petroleum.md) products and services through retail and commercial markets. Learn more about Chevron [here](https://www.chevron.com/).

### BP (British Petroleum)

BP's integrated [supply](../s/supply.md) and trading model provides the framework for its downstream operations. They own and operate a series of refineries and chemicals plants worldwide. You can [gain](../g/gain.md) deeper insights into BP's downstream activities [here](https://www.bp.com/).

## Conclusion

Downstream operations are an essential part of the oil and gas [industry](../i/industry.md)'s [value chain](../v/value_chain.md) and play a critical role in turning [raw materials](../r/raw_materials.md) into finished goods for consumers. This sector involves refining, [distribution](../d/distribution.md), [marketing](../m/marketing.md), selling, and retailing of end products. Not only does it aim at fulfilling consumer [demand](../d/demand.md), it also crucially impacts the [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) due to its comprehensive [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) and extensive operations.

Understanding the holistic dynamics of downstream operations can [offer](../o/offer.md) better clarity into how raw resources transition into daily consumer products, thus highlighting the multifaceted nature of the [petroleum](../p/petroleum.md) [industry](../i/industry.md).

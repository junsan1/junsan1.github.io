# Derivative

In [finance](../f/finance.md), a derivative is a complex [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) whose [value](../v/value.md) is derived from the [value](../v/value.md) of another [asset](../a/asset.md). These other assets are typically called the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets. [Derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) themselves do not have standalone [value](../v/value.md); they are essentially contracts between two or more parties, whose [value](../v/value.md) is based on the price movements of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). This [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) could be commodities, [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, [market](../m/market.md) indexes, or currencies. [Derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) are often used for hedging [risk](../r/risk.md), speculating on future price movements, or getting access to certain markets.

## Types of Derivatives

### 1. **Futures Contracts**
A [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) is an agreement to buy or sell an [asset](../a/asset.md) at a predetermined future date and price. [Futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) are traded on exchanges and are standardized in terms of their expiry date and contract size. They are commonly used to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against price changes in commodities or as a means of [speculation](../s/speculation.md).

### 2. **Options**
[Options](../o/options.md) provide the holder with the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an [asset](../a/asset.md) at a specified price before a certain date. There are two main types of [options](../o/options.md): call [options](../o/options.md) and [put options](../p/put_options.md).

- **[Call Option](../c/call_option.md):** A financial contract that gives the buyer the right to buy an [asset](../a/asset.md) at a specific price within a specific time.
- **[Put Option](../p/put.md):** A contract that gives the buyer the right to sell an [asset](../a/asset.md) at a specific price within a specific time.

### 3. **Swaps**
Swaps are contracts in which two parties [exchange](../e/exchange.md) cash flows or other financial instruments over a specified period. The most common types are [interest rate swaps](../i/interest_rate_swaps.md), [currency](../c/currency.md) swaps, and [commodity](../c/commodity.md) swaps.

- **[Interest Rate Swap](../i/interest_rate_swap.md):** A contract to [exchange](../e/exchange.md) future [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) payments, usually one fixed-rate and one floating-rate.
- **[Currency Swap](../c/currency_swap.md):** A deal to [exchange](../e/exchange.md) [principal](../p/principal.md) and [interest](../i/interest.md) in one [currency](../c/currency.md) for another [currency](../c/currency.md)’s [principal](../p/principal.md) and [interest](../i/interest.md).
- **[Commodity](../c/commodity.md) [Swap](../s/swap.md):** Involves the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) of a [commodity](../c/commodity.md)’s future cash flows at predefined terms.

### 4. **Forwards**
A [forward contract](../f/forward_contract.md) is a customized contract between two parties to buy or sell an [asset](../a/asset.md) at a specified price on a future date. Unlike [futures](../f/futures.md), [forward contracts](../f/forward_contracts.md) are traded over the counter (OTC) and are not standardized or regulated.

### 5. **Credit Derivatives**
[Credit](../c/credit.md) [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) are financial instruments used to manage the [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) of a portfolio. The most common type of [credit](../c/credit.md) derivative is the [credit](../c/credit.md) [default](../d/default.md) [swap](../s/swap.md) (CDS), which allows one party to transfer the [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) of a reference [asset](../a/asset.md) to another party.

## Uses of Derivatives

### 1. **Hedging**
Hedging is a [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) strategy used to [offset](../o/offset.md) losses in investments by taking an opposite position in a related [asset](../a/asset.md). For example, a farmer could use [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) to lock in the price for a crop to protect against the [risk](../r/risk.md) of price fluctuations.

### 2. **Speculation**
Speculators use [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) to bet on the future direction of [market](../m/market.md) prices. While this can result in significant gains, it can also lead to substantial losses. [Derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) allow speculators to take leveraged positions, amplifying both potential rewards and risks.

### 3. **Arbitrage**
[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) involves the simultaneous purchase and [sale](../s/sale.md) of an [asset](../a/asset.md) to [profit](../p/profit.md) from price discrepancies in different markets. Traders use [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) to exploit small differences in the price of related securities.

### 4. **Access to Assets or Markets**
[Derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) can provide access to otherwise hard-to-[trade](../t/trade.md) assets or markets. For example, an [investor](../i/investor.md) may use [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) to [gain](../g/gain.md) exposure to foreign currencies or commodities without actually handling the physical assets.

## Risks Involved

[Derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) come with several types of [risk](../r/risk.md), including:

### 1. **Market Risk**
The [risk](../r/risk.md) that the [value](../v/value.md) of the derivative [will](../w/will.md) change as the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) moves.

### 2. **Credit Risk**
The [risk](../r/risk.md) that one party in the deal [will](../w/will.md) [default](../d/default.md) on its [obligations](../o/obligation.md), leaving the other party exposed to potential losses.

### 3. **Liquidity Risk**
The [risk](../r/risk.md) that a derivative may be difficult to buy or sell without impacting its price.

### 4. **Operational Risk**
Risks arising from the inadequacy or failure of internal processes, systems, or controls.

### 5. **Legal Risk**
The [risk](../r/risk.md) of loss due to uncertain legal standing and potential legal disputes over the terms of the contract.

## Regulatory Environment

Regulation of [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) varies significantly by jurisdiction. In the United States, the [Commodity Futures](../c/commodity_futures.md) Trading [Commission](../c/commission.md) (CFTC) and the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) oversee the [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) markets. Post-2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md), various initiatives like the Dodd-Frank Act have aimed to increase the [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and reduce the [systemic risk](../s/systemic_risk.md) posed by derivative instruments.

Understanding how [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) work and the risks they involve is crucial for anyone involved in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). These instruments are powerful tools for both hedging and [speculation](../s/speculation.md), but they come with complexities and risks that require careful management.

# Discount Broker

A discount broker is a stockbroker who executes buy and sell orders at a reduced commission rate compared to a full-service broker. They do not provide investment advice or perform analysis for their clients, a key factor that allows them to charge lower fees. This model caters primarily to self-directed investors who do not require extensive advisory services and are comfortable making their own investment decisions.

This allowed brokers to set their own fees, breaking the monopoly of full-service brokers who charged high commissions.

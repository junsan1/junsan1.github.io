### Blockchain Integration

### Smart Contracts
The platform relies on [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md) for executing trades. These are self-executing contracts where the terms of the agreement are directly written into code. [Smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md) increase [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and reduce the possibility of [fraud](../f/fraud.md).

  "api_key": "your_api_key",
  "symbol": "BTCUSDT",

  "quantity": 0.01,
  "price": 50000
}
```

- **Two-[Factor](../f/factor.md) Authentication (2FA)**: Adds an extra layer of [security](../s/security.md).

- **DDoS Protection**: Protects against Distributed Denial of Service attacks.

## Trading Pairs and Market Cap
The platform supports numerous trading pairs and enjoys a sizable [market](../m/market.md) cap due to its extensive user base and high [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md). The availability of [multiple](../m/multiple.md) trading pairs allows users to diversify their investment portfolio effectively.

## Liquidity Pools
[Liquidity pools](../l/liquidity_pools.md) are crucial for the functioning of Dex-[Trade](../t/trade.md). They allow for the pooling of assets which traders can [trade](../t/trade.md) against, thus providing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md). Users who contribute to the [liquidity pools](../l/liquidity_pools.md) are rewarded with a percentage of the trading fees generated.

#### Example of Liquidity Pool Contribution:
- **User deposits**: 10 ETH in the ETH/USDT [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) pool.
- **Rewards**: The user earns a share of the trading fees proportional to their contribution to the pool.

## Staking Rewards
Staking is another key feature offered by Dex-[Trade](../t/trade.md). Users can stake their cryptocurrencies to earn rewards in the form of more crypto. The staking process is straightforward and offers an annual percentage [yield](../y/yield.md) (APY) which varies depending on the cryptocurrency being staked.

#### Example of Staking:
- **Stake Amount**: 500 USDT
- **APY**: 12%
- **[Duration](../d/duration.md)**: 1 year
- **Rewards**: 500 USDT * 0.12 = 60 USDT after one year

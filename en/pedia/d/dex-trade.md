}

- **Cold Storage**: Stores the majority of funds in offline wallets to protect against hacking attempts.
- **DDoS Protection**: Protects against Distributed Denial of Service attacks.

## Trading Pairs and Market Cap
The platform supports numerous trading pairs and enjoys a sizable market cap due to its extensive user base and high liquidity. The availability of multiple trading pairs allows users to diversify their investment portfolio effectively.

## Liquidity Pools
Liquidity pools are crucial for the functioning of Dex-Trade. They allow for the pooling of assets which traders can trade against, thus providing liquidity. Users who contribute to the liquidity pools are rewarded with a percentage of the trading fees generated.

#### Example of Liquidity Pool Contribution:
- **User deposits**: 10 ETH in the ETH/USDT liquidity pool.
- **Rewards**: The user earns a share of the trading fees proportional to their contribution to the pool.

## Staking Rewards
Staking is another key feature offered by Dex-Trade. Users can stake their cryptocurrencies to earn rewards in the form of more crypto. The staking process is straightforward and offers an annual percentage yield (APY) which varies depending on the cryptocurrency being staked.

#### Example of Staking:
- **Stake Amount**: 500 USDT
- **APY**: 12%
- **Duration**: 1 year
- **Rewards**: 500 USDT * 0.12 = 60 USDT after one year

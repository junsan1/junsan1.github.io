# Decreasing Term Insurance

Decreasing Term [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) is a type of [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) that offers a [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) that decreases over time, usually on a regular [basis](../b/basis.md) such as annually. Unlike level term [insurance](../i/insurance.md), where the [payout](../p/payout.md) amount remains constant throughout the term, decreasing term [insurance](../i/insurance.md) reduces the sum insured at a predetermined rate. It is often designed to align with declining financial [obligations](../o/obligation.md), such as a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) or other loans.

## Purpose and Use

Decreasing term [insurance](../i/insurance.md) is typically used to cover a specific [liability](../l/liability.md) that diminishes over time. The most common scenario is [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) protection. As the outstanding balance of a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) decreases with regular repayments, the need for a substantial [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) also diminishes. Here are some key uses:

- **[Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) Repayments:** Homeowners often take out decreasing term [insurance](../i/insurance.md) to ensure that any remaining [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [debt](../d/debt.md) would be paid off in the event of their death.
- **[Loan](../l/loan.md) Agreements:** Borrowers may use this [insurance](../i/insurance.md) to cover personal or [business](../b/business.md) loans that diminish over time.
- **[Income](../i/income.md) Replacement:** Some use it to replace [income](../i/income.md) that decreases over time due to diminishing responsibilities, such as raising children where expenses decrease as children become independent.

## Structure and Function

### Premiums

The premiums for decreasing term [insurance](../i/insurance.md) are generally fixed throughout the term of the policy, despite the decreasing [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md). This makes it easier to [budget](../b/budget.md) and plan financial [obligations](../o/obligation.md). Because the [risk](../r/risk.md) to the insurer diminishes over time (as the [payout](../p/payout.md) decreases), these policies can often be more affordable than level term [insurance](../i/insurance.md).

### Death Benefit

The primary characteristic of decreasing term [insurance](../i/insurance.md) is the reducing [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md). The rate at which this benefit decreases is established at the inception of the policy. Commonly, this might be a uniform reduction, for example, 5% per year, though some policies might tailor the reduction to better match specific [obligations](../o/obligation.md) like a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [amortization schedule](../a/amortization.md).

### Term Length

The term length of a decreasing term [insurance](../i/insurance.md) policy can often be chosen to match the life of the financial obligation. For instance, if the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) is meant to cover a 30-year [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md), the term of the policy would likely be 30 years as well.

## Types of Decreasing Term Insurance

### Mortgage Decreasing Term Assurance (MDTA)

This form is specifically tailored to pair with a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md). Since most mortgages are structured with decreasing balances over time (especially those utilizing fixed [interest](../i/interest.md) rates), MDTA aligns the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) coverage accordingly.

### Credit Life Insurance

[Credit](../c/credit.md) [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) is a specific type of decreasing term [insurance](../i/insurance.md) designed to pay off a [debt](../d/debt.md) in the event of the policyholder's death. Similar to MDTA, the [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) reduces as the [debt](../d/debt.md) decreases.

### Business Loans

Businesses sometimes use decreasing term [insurance](../i/insurance.md) to cover specific loans they have taken. The logic here is the same: as the [loan](../l/loan.md) gets paid off, the required coverage decreases.

## Comparison with Level Term Insurance

### Benefits

- **Cost-Effective:** Generally, the premiums for decreasing term [insurance](../i/insurance.md) are lower than for level term [insurance](../i/insurance.md) due to the reduced [risk](../r/risk.md) over time.
- **[Budget](../b/budget.md)-Friendly:** Fixed premiums make it easier to [budget](../b/budget.md) compared to policies with escalating premiums.
- **Targeted Coverage:** It aligns precisely with declining financial responsibilities, making it a practical choice for specific debts.

### Drawbacks

- **Reduced [Death Benefit](../d/death_benefit.md):** While the premiums remain constant, the [payout](../p/payout.md) decreases, which could be a disadvantage if a larger [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) is needed later in the term.
- **Less Suitable for Long-Term Needs:** This type of [insurance](../i/insurance.md) is less effective for long-term financial needs beyond paying off a specific [debt](../d/debt.md), unlike whole life or level term [insurance](../i/insurance.md).

## Financial Planning Considerations

When considering decreasing term [insurance](../i/insurance.md), itâ€™s essential to assess long-term financial needs. This involves calculating the expected reduction in financial [obligations](../o/obligation.md) over time and considering any other potential needs beyond those covered by the decreasing term policy.

### Suitability

Decreasing term [insurance](../i/insurance.md) is particularly suitable for:

- Individuals with significant [debt](../d/debt.md) that [will](../w/will.md) decrease over time.
- Homeowners looking to insure their [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md).
- [Business](../b/business.md) owners seeking to cover specific loans or lines of [credit](../c/credit.md).

### Unsuitability

However, it might not be the best choice for:

- Those needing a consistent and sizeable [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md).
- Individuals looking to cover lifelong financial responsibilities or [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md).

## Policy Variations and Customizations

Different insurers [offer](../o/offer.md) various forms of decreasing term [insurance](../i/insurance.md). Some policies may allow for certain flexibilities, such as:

- **Recalculation:** Option to adjust the rate at which the [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) decreases.
- **Convertible Policies:** Ability to convert the policy to [permanent life insurance](../p/permanent_life_insurance.md) if longer-term coverage becomes necessary.
- **[Joint](../j/joint.md) Life Policies:** Coverage for two lives, often used by couples to cover a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) jointly.

## Major Providers and Products

Several [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies [offer](../o/offer.md) decreasing term [insurance](../i/insurance.md) with differing features and [premium](../p/premium.md) structures. Examples of well-known providers include:

- **Legal & General:** Offers [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) decreasing term [assurance](../a/assurance.md) with various customization [options](../o/options.md).

- **Age:** Younger individuals typically pay lower premiums.
- **Health:** Those in good health get better rates.
- **Smoking Status:** Non-smokers benefit from lower premiums.
- **Term Length:** Longer terms may result in higher overall costs due to the extended [risk](../r/risk.md) period, despite the decreasing benefit.

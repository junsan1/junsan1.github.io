# Financial Derivatives

Financial [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) are complex financial instruments whose [value](../v/value.md) is derived from the [value](../v/value.md) of an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), [index](../i/index.md), or rate. [Derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) are commonly used for hedging [risk](../r/risk.md) or for speculative purposes. This document [will](../w/will.md) explore the myriad aspects of financial [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), diving into their types, uses, risks, history, and regulatory considerations.

## Types of Financial Derivatives

The primary types of financial [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) include [futures](../f/futures.md), forwards, [options](../o/options.md), and swaps. Each of these [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) serves different functions and has unique characteristics.

### Futures

[Futures](../f/futures.md) are standardized contracts traded on exchanges, obligating the buyer to purchase, and the seller to sell, an [asset](../a/asset.md) at a predetermined future date and price. Key features of [futures](../f/futures.md) include:

1. **Standardization**: The terms of the contract, such as quantity and quality of the [asset](../a/asset.md), are standardized by the [exchange](../e/exchange.md).
2. **[Margin](../m/margin.md) Requirements**: Both parties are required to [deposit](../d/deposit.md) a [margin](../m/margin.md) to ensure contract performance.
3. **Mark-to-[Market](../m/market.md)**: [Futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) are marked to [market](../m/market.md) daily, meaning the contract's [value](../v/value.md) is recalculated based on its current [market price](../m/market_price.md).

### Forwards

Forwards are customized contracts between two parties to buy or sell an [asset](../a/asset.md) at a specific price on a future date. Unlike [futures](../f/futures.md), forwards are not traded on an [exchange](../e/exchange.md) and include:

1. **Customization**: The terms of the contract can be tailored to the needs of both parties.
2. **[Counterparty Risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md)**: Since forwards are not standardized or regulated by an [exchange](../e/exchange.md), there is a higher degree of [counterparty risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md).
3. **No Daily Settlement**: Forwards do not have daily mark-to-[market](../m/market.md) pricing.

### Options

[Options](../o/options.md) give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy ([call option](../c/call_option.md)) or sell ([put option](../p/put.md)) an [asset](../a/asset.md) at a predetermined price within a specific period. Key aspects include:

1. **Premiums**: The buyer of an option pays a [premium](../p/premium.md) to the seller for this right.
2. **[Expiration Date](../e/expiration_date.md)**: [Options](../o/options.md) have a defined [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md) after which the option can no longer be exercised.
3. **[Strike Price](../s/strike_price.md)**: The price at which the option holder can buy or sell the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

### Swaps

Swaps involve two parties exchanging cash flows or other financial instruments. The most common types of swaps are [interest rate swaps](../i/interest_rate_swaps.md) and [currency](../c/currency.md) swaps:

1. **[Interest Rate Swaps](../i/interest_rate_swaps.md)**: Parties [exchange](../e/exchange.md) cash flows based on different [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. For example, swapping fixed-rate [interest](../i/interest.md) payments for floating-rate payments.
2. **[Currency](../c/currency.md) Swaps**: Parties [exchange](../e/exchange.md) [principal](../p/principal.md) and [interest](../i/interest.md) payments in different currencies.

## Uses of Financial Derivatives

[Derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) are used for several purposes, including hedging, [speculation](../s/speculation.md), [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), and enhancing returns.

### Hedging

Hedging involves using [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) to reduce or eliminate risks associated with price movements in an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). Companies often use hedging to manage [currency](../c/currency.md) [risk](../r/risk.md), [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md), or [commodity](../c/commodity.md) price [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Speculation

Speculators aim to [profit](../p/profit.md) from price movements in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). By predicting [market](../m/market.md) trends and price movements, traders use [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) to [leverage](../l/leverage.md) positions and potentially achieve higher returns.

### Arbitrage

[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) involves exploiting price differences between markets or instruments. [Derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) facilitate [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) opportunities by allowing traders to simultaneously buy and sell assets or contracts in different markets to lock in [risk](../r/risk.md)-free profits.

### Enhancing Returns

Some investors use [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) to enhance portfolio returns. For example, writing [covered call](../c/covered_call.md) [options](../o/options.md) can generate additional [income](../i/income.md) from a stock portfolio.

## Risks Associated with Financial Derivatives

While [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) numerous benefits, they also come with significant risks:

### Market Risk

The primary [risk](../r/risk.md) is that of [market](../m/market.md) fluctuations affecting the [value](../v/value.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), leading to potential losses.

### Credit Risk

[Counterparty risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md) is the [risk](../r/risk.md) that the other party in a [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) contract [will](../w/will.md) [default](../d/default.md) on their [obligations](../o/obligation.md).

### Liquidity Risk

Some [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), particularly over-the-counter (OTC) [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) like forwards and swaps, can be less [liquid](../l/liquid.md), making it difficult to exit positions.

### Operational Risk

This [risk](../r/risk.md) arises from failures in internal processes, systems, or controls, leading to losses.

### Legal and Regulatory Risk

Changes in laws, regulations, or enforcement actions can impact the [value](../v/value.md) or legality of [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) contracts.

## Historical Perspective

The use of financial [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) dates back centuries. Early [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) were used in Japan's rice markets in the 1600s. The modern [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) [market](../m/market.md) has expanded exponentially since the 1970s with the introduction of [financial engineering](../f/financial_engineering.md) and complex products.

### Modern Milestones

1. **1973**: Introduction of the [Black-Scholes model](../b/black-scholes_model.md) for option pricing, revolutionizing [options](../o/options.md) trading.
2. **1982**: Launch of [interest rate swaps](../i/interest_rate_swaps.md) by the [World Bank](../w/world_bank.md) and IBM.
3. **2000s**: Explosive growth in [credit](../c/credit.md) [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), particularly [credit default swaps](../c/credit_default_swaps.md) (CDS).

## Regulatory Environment

[Derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) markets are highly regulated to mitigate [systemic risk](../s/systemic_risk.md) and protect investors. Key regulatory frameworks include:

### Dodd-Frank Act (USA)

Implemented in response to the 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md), Dodd-Frank mandates greater [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and oversight for OTC [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) markets. It includes:

1. **Central [Clearing](../c/clearing.md)**: Requires many OTC [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) to be cleared through central counterparties to reduce [counterparty risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md).
2. **Reporting Requirements**: Comprehensive record-keeping and reporting requirements for [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) transactions.

### European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)

EMIR regulates OTC [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), central counterparties, and [trade](../t/trade.md) repositories in the [European Union](../e/european_union_(eu).md):

1. **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Mitigation**: Imposes [risk](../r/risk.md) mitigation techniques for non-cleared OTC [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md).
2. **[Transparency](../t/transparency.md)**: Increases [market](../m/market.md) [transparency](../t/transparency.md) through reporting and public [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) requirements.

# Financial Derivatives

Financial [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) are complex financial instruments whose value is derived from the value of an underlying asset, index, or rate. [Derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) are commonly used for hedging risk or for speculative purposes. This document will explore the myriad aspects of financial [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), diving into their types, uses, risks, history, and regulatory considerations.

## Types of Financial Derivatives

The primary types of financial [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) include futures, forwards, options, and swaps. Each of these [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) serves different functions and has unique characteristics.

### Futures

Futures are standardized contracts traded on exchanges, obligating the buyer to purchase, and the seller to sell, an asset at a predetermined future date and price. Key features of futures include:

1. **Standardization**: The terms of the contract, such as quantity and quality of the asset, are standardized by the exchange.
2. **Margin Requirements**: Both parties are required to deposit a margin to ensure contract performance.
3. **Mark-to-Market**: [Futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) are marked to market daily, meaning the contract's value is recalculated based on its current market price.

### Forwards

Forwards are customized contracts between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a specific price on a future date. Unlike futures, forwards are not traded on an exchange and include:

1. **Customization**: The terms of the contract can be tailored to the needs of both parties.
2. **[Counterparty Risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md)**: Since forwards are not standardized or regulated by an exchange, there is a higher degree of [counterparty risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md).
3. **No Daily Settlement**: Forwards do not have daily mark-to-market pricing.

### Options

Options give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an asset at a predetermined price within a specific period. Key aspects include:

1. **Premiums**: The buyer of an option pays a premium to the seller for this right.
2. **Expiration Date**: Options have a defined expiration date after which the option can no longer be exercised.
3. **Strike Price**: The price at which the option holder can buy or sell the underlying asset.

### Swaps

Swaps involve two parties exchanging cash flows or other financial instruments. The most common types of swaps are [interest rate swaps](../i/interest_rate_swaps.md) and currency swaps:

1. **[Interest Rate Swaps](../i/interest_rate_swaps.md)**: Parties exchange cash flows based on different interest rates. For example, swapping fixed-rate interest payments for floating-rate payments.
2. **Currency Swaps**: Parties exchange principal and interest payments in different currencies.

## Uses of Financial Derivatives

[Derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) are used for several purposes, including hedging, speculation, [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), and enhancing returns.

### Hedging

Hedging involves using [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) to reduce or eliminate risks associated with price movements in an underlying asset. Companies often use hedging to manage currency risk, interest rate risk, or commodity price risk.

### Speculation

Speculators aim to profit from price movements in the underlying asset. By predicting market trends and price movements, traders use [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) to leverage positions and potentially achieve higher returns.

### Arbitrage

[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) involves exploiting price differences between markets or instruments. [Derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) facilitate [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) opportunities by allowing traders to simultaneously buy and sell assets or contracts in different markets to lock in risk-free profits.

### Enhancing Returns

Some investors use [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) to enhance portfolio returns. For example, writing covered call options can generate additional income from a stock portfolio.

## Risks Associated with Financial Derivatives

While [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) offer numerous benefits, they also come with significant risks:

### Market Risk

The primary risk is that of market fluctuations affecting the value of the underlying asset, leading to potential losses.

### Credit Risk

[Counterparty risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md) is the risk that the other party in a [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) contract will default on their obligations.

### Liquidity Risk

Some [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), particularly over-the-counter (OTC) [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) like forwards and swaps, can be less liquid, making it difficult to exit positions.

### Operational Risk

This risk arises from failures in internal processes, systems, or controls, leading to losses.

### Legal and Regulatory Risk

Changes in laws, regulations, or enforcement actions can impact the value or legality of [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) contracts.

## Historical Perspective

The use of financial [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) dates back centuries. Early [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) were used in Japan's rice markets in the 1600s. The modern [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) market has expanded exponentially since the 1970s with the introduction of [financial engineering](../f/financial_engineering.md) and complex products.

### Modern Milestones

1. **1973**: Introduction of the [Black-Scholes model](../b/black-scholes_model.md) for option pricing, revolutionizing options trading.
2. **1982**: Launch of [interest rate swaps](../i/interest_rate_swaps.md) by the World Bank and IBM.
3. **2000s**: Explosive growth in credit [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), particularly [credit default swaps](../c/credit_default_swaps.md) (CDS).

## Regulatory Environment

[Derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) markets are highly regulated to mitigate systemic risk and protect investors. Key regulatory frameworks include:

### Dodd-Frank Act (USA)

Implemented in response to the 2008 financial crisis, Dodd-Frank mandates greater transparency and oversight for OTC [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) markets. It includes:

1. **Central Clearing**: Requires many OTC [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) to be cleared through central counterparties to reduce [counterparty risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md).
2. **Reporting Requirements**: Comprehensive record-keeping and reporting requirements for [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) transactions.

### European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)

EMIR regulates OTC [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), central counterparties, and trade repositories in the European Union:

1. **Risk Mitigation**: Imposes risk mitigation techniques for non-cleared OTC [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md).
2. **Transparency**: Increases market transparency through reporting and public disclosure requirements.

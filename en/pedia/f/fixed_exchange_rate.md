# Fixed Exchange Rate

A fixed [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md), also known as a pegged [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md), is a type of [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) regime where a [currency](../c/currency.md)'s [value](../v/value.md) is tied or pegged to another major [currency](../c/currency.md), such as the US dollar or gold. This system aims to provide greater stability in [foreign exchange](../f/foreign_exchange.md) markets, foster economic predictability, and prevent excessive fluctuations in [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates that can disrupt economic stability.

## Introduction to Fixed Exchange Rates

A fixed [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) system is created when a country’s government or central [bank](../b/bank.md) commits to keeping its [currency](../c/currency.md) at a set [value](../v/value.md) compared to another reference [currency](../c/currency.md) or basket of currencies. For example, if Country A decides to peg its [currency](../c/currency.md) to the US dollar, it [will](../w/will.md) adjust its monetary policies to ensure that the [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) remains consistent with the predetermined rate. Any [devaluation](../d/devaluation.md) or appreciation beyond the fixed [range](../r/range.md) [will](../w/will.md) be countered through various measures including buying or selling currencies, altering [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, or changing [reserve requirements](../r/reserve_requirements.md).

## Mechanisms of Maintaining a Fixed Exchange Rate

### Currency Market Interventions

Central banks actively buy or sell their own [currency](../c/currency.md) in the [foreign exchange](../f/foreign_exchange.md) [market](../m/market.md) to maintain the pegged rate. For example, if the [currency](../c/currency.md) [value](../v/value.md) goes above the pegged rate, the central [bank](../b/bank.md) might sell its own [currency](../c/currency.md) and buy foreign [currency](../c/currency.md) to increase [supply](../s/supply.md) and bring the [value](../v/value.md) down.

### Monetary Policy Adjustments

To maintain a fixed [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md), countries may shift their monetary policies, such as changing [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and [reserve requirements](../r/reserve_requirements.md) to influence [currency](../c/currency.md) [demand](../d/demand.md) and [supply](../s/supply.md). A high [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) might attract [foreign investment](../f/foreign_investment.md), leading to higher [demand](../d/demand.md) for the domestic [currency](../c/currency.md), while lower rates might reduce its [value](../v/value.md).

### Foreign Reserves

Central banks [hold](../h/hold.md) significant foreign reserves, which are used to intervene in the [currency](../c/currency.md) [market](../m/market.md) when required. For instance, holding US dollars as a reserve allows a country to buy back its own [currency](../c/currency.md) if it depreciates too much against the dollar.

### Capital Controls

In certain cases, governments may enforce [capital](../c/capital.md) controls to restrict the flow of [capital](../c/capital.md) in and out of the country, thereby stabilizing the [currency](../c/currency.md). These controls prevent speculators from flooding the [market](../m/market.md), which could destabilize the fixed [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md).

## Examples of Fixed Exchange Rate Regimes

### The Hong Kong Dollar

One of the most prominent examples of a fixed [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) is the Hong Kong dollar, which has been pegged to the US dollar since 1983. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) maintains this peg at a rate of HK$7.80 to US$1, with allowable fluctuations between HK$7.75 and HK$7.85.

### The Chinese Yuan

The Chinese yuan (renminbi) was pegged to the US dollar for a long period before China shifted to a more flexible, but still controlled, [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) system in 2005. While not strictly a fixed [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md), it is a managed [float](../f/float.md) with tight controls to prevent excessive [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

### The Saudi Riyal

The Saudi riyal is pegged to the US dollar at a rate of approximately SAR3.75 to US$1. This fixed [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) helps the country stabilize its [economy](../e/economy.md), heavily reliant on oil exports priced in US dollars.

## Benefits of a Fixed Exchange Rate

### Economic Stability

A fixed [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) creates a stable economic environment, reducing the [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) in international [trade](../t/trade.md) and investment. Businesses and investors can plan with greater certainty without worrying about [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md)-induced losses or gains.

### Inflation Control

[Tying](../t/tying.md) the [national currency](../n/national_currency.md) to a stable and low-[inflation](../i/inflation.md) [currency](../c/currency.md), such as the US dollar, can help control domestic [inflation](../i/inflation.md). The need to maintain the peg can lead to disciplined fiscal and monetary policies, indirectly curbing the [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rate.

### Attraction of Foreign Investment

Stability in [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates can attract foreign investors looking for a predictable [return](../r/return.md) on investment. The reduced [risk](../r/risk.md) of [currency](../c/currency.md) [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) makes investments in pegged [currency](../c/currency.md) countries more attractive.

### Balance of Payments Stability

By fixing the [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md), countries can avoid large imbalances in their balance of payments. The stability ensures that imports and exports remain balanced without drastic changes in [currency](../c/currency.md) [value](../v/value.md) affecting [trade](../t/trade.md) flows.

## Drawbacks of a Fixed Exchange Rate

### Limited Monetary Policy Autonomy

Maintaining a fixed [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) can limit a country’s ability to use its [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) effectively. For instance, to keep the [currency](../c/currency.md) pegged, a central [bank](../b/bank.md) might need to align its [interest](../i/interest.md) rates closely with the anchor [currency](../c/currency.md)'s rates, even if those rates are not suitable for the domestic [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md).

### Risk of Speculative Attacks

Fixed [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) regimes can attract speculative attacks if investors believe that the [currency](../c/currency.md) is [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md) or [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md). These attacks can deplete a country’s foreign reserves rapidly and force [devaluation](../d/devaluation.md), leading to economic turmoil.

### Deflationary Pressures

To maintain a fixed [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md), especially in periods of economic downturns, countries may need to implement deflationary policies such as reducing public spending and increasing [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. These measures can lead to increased [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) and reduced [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md).

### Balance of Payments Crisis

Countries with fixed [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates can face balance of payments crises if they run persistent [trade](../t/trade.md) deficits. The need to maintain the peg can deplete foreign reserves, creating pressures that might ultimately force a [currency](../c/currency.md) [devaluation](../d/devaluation.md).

## Historical Context

### Bretton Woods System

One of the most significant implementations of a fixed [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) system was the Bretton Woods Agreement established in 1944. Under this system, currencies of participating countries were pegged to the US dollar, which was, in turn, convertible to gold. This system aimed to stabilize economies post-World War II but collapsed in 1971 when the US suspended gold convertibility, leading to the modern system of floating [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates.

### Gold Standard

Before Bretton Woods, many countries operated under the [gold standard](../g/gold_standard.md), where currencies were directly linked to gold. This system provided long-term price stability but was eventually abandoned due to its inability to accommodate economic flexibility during periods of financial crises and wars.

## Implementing a Fixed Exchange Rate

### Prerequisites

1. **Adequate Foreign Reserves:** Ensures that a central [bank](../b/bank.md) can intervene in the forex [market](../m/market.md) to maintain the [currency peg](../c/currency_peg.md).
2. **Stable Anchor [Currency](../c/currency.md):** The choice of an anchor [currency](../c/currency.md) with low [inflation](../i/inflation.md) and stable economic policies is crucial.
3. **[Robust](../r/robust.md) Economic Policies:** Discipline in fiscal and monetary policies is necessary to avoid scenarios requiring frequent adjustments.

### Steps to Implementation

1. **Determine the Peg:** Decide on the [currency](../c/currency.md) or basket of currencies to peg the domestic [currency](../c/currency.md) against.
2. **Set the Rate:** Establish the [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) to be maintained.
3. **Prepare Reserves:** Accumulate foreign reserves to support interventions.
4. **Legislative Framework:** Create laws and regulations to support the fixed [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) regime.
5. **Communicate Policy:** Announce the policy to the public and international markets to build credibility.

### Case Study: Argentina’s Currency Board

In the early 1990s, Argentina implemented a [currency](../c/currency.md) board system, [pegging](../p/pegging.md) the Argentine peso to the US dollar. The system initially succeeded in quelling [hyperinflation](../h/hyperinflation.md) and stabilizing the [economy](../e/economy.md). However, maintaining the peg in the face of external economic pressures and rigid monetary policies led to a [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md), resulting in the abandonment of the system in 2001.

## Conclusion

A fixed [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) system offers numerous advantages in terms of economic stability, [inflation](../i/inflation.md) control, and attracting [foreign investment](../f/foreign_investment.md), but it also comes with significant risks and limitations. Countries must weigh these benefits and drawbacks carefully before deciding to implement or maintain a fixed [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) regime. The success of such a system largely depends on the country's economic policies, the choice of the anchor [currency](../c/currency.md), and the ability to maintain sufficient foreign reserves. Central banks and governments should be prepared to face challenges such as speculative attacks and balance of payments crises and take measures to mitigate these risks. Understanding the complex dynamics of fixed [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) systems can help policymakers make informed decisions that balance stability with economic flexibility.

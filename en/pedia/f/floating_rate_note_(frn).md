# Floating Rate Note (FRN)

A Floating Rate [Note](../n/note.md) (FRN) is a type of [bond](../b/bond.md) or [debt instrument](../d/debt_instrument.md) with a [variable interest rate](../v/variable_interest_rate.md). Unlike fixed-rate bonds that have consistent [interest](../i/interest.md) payments throughout their life, the [interest](../i/interest.md) payments on FRNs fluctuate, typically in line with [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) rates such as LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), EURIBOR ([Euro](../e/euro.md) Interbank Offered Rate), or the [Federal Funds Rate](../f/federal_funds_rate.md). This unique characteristic makes FRNs attractive to investors looking to mitigate [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md), particularly during periods of rising or volatile [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

## Overview

FRNs can be issued by governments, financial institutions, and corporations. They are particularly common in the banking sector. These notes [offer](../o/offer.md) a number of advantages and disadvantages that appeal to different types of investors. Understanding the mechanics of FRNs is crucial for making informed investment decisions and managing [risk](../r/risk.md). 

### Structure

The [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) on an FRN is composed of two components:
1. **[Reference Rate](../r/reference_rate.md):** This is the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md), such as LIBOR, that the FRN's [interest](../i/interest.md) payments track.
2. **Spread:** This is an additional amount, stated in [basis](../b/basis.md) points, added to the [reference rate](../r/reference_rate.md) to calculate the total [interest](../i/interest.md) [payment](../p/payment.md). The spread remains constant over the life of the FRN.

For example, if an FRN is pegged to the 3-month LIBOR with a spread of 100 [basis](../b/basis.md) points (1%), and the current 3-month LIBOR is 2.5%, the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) for the FRN would be 3.5%.

[Interest](../i/interest.md) payments are made at regular intervals, commonly quarterly or semi-annually. As the [reference rate](../r/reference_rate.md) changes, so does the [interest](../i/interest.md) [payment](../p/payment.md) amount, allowing the FRN to adapt to [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

### Benefits

**1. Protection Against [Interest Rate Risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md):**
Since their [interest](../i/interest.md) payments adjust with [market](../m/market.md) rates, FRNs [offer](../o/offer.md) protection against the [risk](../r/risk.md) of rising [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, which can erode the [value](../v/value.md) of fixed-rate bonds.

**2. Predictable Spread Over Benchmarks:**
Investors know the spread over the [reference rate](../r/reference_rate.md) for the life of the [note](../n/note.md), providing a degree of predictability while still capturing upward movements in the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) rates.

**3. Frequent Payments:**
FRNs often pay [interest](../i/interest.md) more frequently than many fixed-rate bonds, making them attractive to investors seeking regular [income](../i/income.md).

### Risks

**1. [Interest Rate](../i/interest_rate.md) Decline:**
When [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) rates fall, the [interest](../i/interest.md) payments on FRNs decline as well, potentially reducing the [income](../i/income.md) to investors.

**2. Complexity:**
The structured nature of FRNs and their reliance on [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) indices can make them more complex to understand and manage compared to fixed-rate bonds.

**3. [Credit Risk](../c/credit_risk.md):**
As with any [bond](../b/bond.md), there remains the [risk](../r/risk.md) that the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) could [default](../d/default.md) on their payments.

## Types of Floating Rate Notes

FRNs can come in various forms, each tailored to the needs of different issuers and investors.

### Government FRNs

Governments occasionally [issue](../i/issue.md) FRNs to [finance](../f/finance.md) their activities while managing borrowing costs in line with current [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. For instance, the [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) began issuing [Floating Rate Notes](../f/floating_rate_notes.md) in January 2014, linked to the 13-week Treasury [bill auction](../b/bill_auction.md).

### Corporate FRNs

Corporations [issue](../i/issue.md) FRNs to [fund](../f/fund.md) operations, acquisitions, or other significant expenditures. These notes provide companies with flexibility in managing [interest](../i/interest.md) payments aligned with [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

### Municipal FRNs

Municipalities may [issue](../i/issue.md) FRNs to raise funds for public projects. These notes often come with tax advantages, such as [tax-exempt interest](../t/tax-exempt_interest.md), making them appealing to certain investors.

## Benchmark Rates

Effective [floating rate notes](../f/floating_rate_notes.md) rely on well-established and transparent [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) rates. The commonly used benchmarks include:

### LIBOR

LIBOR has been the primary [reference rate](../r/reference_rate.md) for many FRNs globally. However, due to past manipulation scandals and the transition to more reliable benchmarks, LIBOR is scheduled to be phased out by the end of 2021.

### EURIBOR

The [Euro](../e/euro.md) Interbank Offered Rate is used primarily for FRNs issued in euros. EURIBOR operates similarly to LIBOR, providing a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for short-term interbank lending rates within the [eurozone](../e/eurozone.md).

### Federal Funds Rate

The [Federal Funds Rate](../f/federal_funds_rate.md), set by the Federal Reserve, is a crucial [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) influencing short-term [interest](../i/interest.md) rates in the United States. It's a key reference point for U.S. dollar-denominated FRNs.

### SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate)

As LIBOR phases out, SOFR emerged as a prominent replacement. SOFR is based on overnight repurchase agreement transactions secured by [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) securities, [offering](../o/offering.md) a more transparent and [robust](../r/robust.md) [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md). The transition to SOFR is an ongoing process, impacting many FRNs traditionally tied to LIBOR.

## Issuance and Trading

FRNs are typically issued at [par value](../p/par_value.md) ([face value](../f/face_value.md)) and can be bought and sold in secondary markets. Their prices may fluctuate based on changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, [credit](../c/credit.md) conditions, and the issuing entity's [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md).

### Primary Market

In the [primary market](../p/primary_market.md), FRNs are issued directly by the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) to investors, usually through an [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) process involving [investment banks](../i/investment_bank_(ib).md). The terms of issuance, including the [reference rate](../r/reference_rate.md) and spread, are defined in the [prospectus](../p/prospectus.md).

### Secondary Market

After issuance, FRNs [trade](../t/trade.md) in the [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md) among institutional and retail investors. These trades occur on exchanges like the New York Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (NYSE) or [over-the-counter (OTC) markets](../o/over-the-counter_markets.md). The [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md) provides [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), allowing investors to buy or sell FRNs before [maturity](../m/maturity.md).

### Pricing

The price of an FRN in the [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md) is influenced by:
- Current [interest](../i/interest.md) rates: Rising rates can increase the [value](../v/value.md) of an FRN, while falling rates can decrease it.
- [Credit](../c/credit.md) quality of the [issuer](../i/issuer.md): Changes in the perceived [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) can impact the price.
- Remaining time to [maturity](../m/maturity.md): Prices can be affected by the proximity of [interest](../i/interest.md) reset dates and the overall time left until [maturity](../m/maturity.md).

## Example

Consider a [corporation](../c/corporation.md) that issues a 5-year FRN with the following terms:
- [Reference Rate](../r/reference_rate.md): 3-month LIBOR
- Spread: 150 [basis](../b/basis.md) points (1.5%)

If the 3-month LIBOR is currently 2%, the first quarterly [interest](../i/interest.md) [payment](../p/payment.md) [will](../w/will.md) be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Interest Payment} = \text{[Principal](../p/principal.md)} \times (\text{LIBOR} + \text{Spread}) \]

Assuming a [principal](../p/principal.md) amount of $1,000,000:
\[ \text{[Interest](../i/interest.md) [Payment](../p/payment.md)} = 1,000,000 \times (0.02 + 0.015) = 1,000,000 \times 0.035 = \$35,000 \]

Every three months, the 3-month LIBOR [will](../w/will.md) be reassessed, and the [interest](../i/interest.md) [payment](../p/payment.md) [will](../w/will.md) adjust accordingly. If, in the subsequent period, the 3-month LIBOR rises to 2.5%, the next [interest](../i/interest.md) [payment](../p/payment.md) calculation [will](../w/will.md) be:
\[ \text{[Interest](../i/interest.md) [Payment](../p/payment.md)} = 1,000,000 \times (0.025 + 0.015) = 1,000,000 \times 0.04 = \$40,000 \]

## Applications of Floating Rate Notes

### Portfolio Diversification

FRNs add [diversification](../d/diversification.md) to an [investor](../i/investor.md)'s portfolio. Their performance often contrasts with fixed-rate securities, [offering](../o/offering.md) balance during fluctuating [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) environments.

### Hedge Against Inflation

Since FRN [interest](../i/interest.md) payments adjust with [market](../m/market.md) rates, they can serve as a [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against [inflation](../i/inflation.md). Rising [inflation](../i/inflation.md) typically leads to higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, which in turn increases FRN [interest](../i/interest.md) payments.

### Liquidity Management

Institutions like banks use FRNs as part of their [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) management strategies. Their adjustable rates make them attractive for maintaining optimal levels of [liquid](../l/liquid.md) assets while still earning [interest](../i/interest.md).

### Risk Management

Corporations and financial institutions may [issue](../i/issue.md) FRNs to manage their [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) exposure. By aligning [debt](../d/debt.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) payments with variable [revenue](../r/revenue.md) streams, they can reduce the mismatch between [asset](../a/asset.md) and [liability](../l/liability.md) durations.

## Regulatory Considerations

The regulatory environment for FRNs is dynamic, with changes impacting both issuers and investors. Key regulatory aspects include:

### Benchmark Reform

The transition from LIBOR to alternative benchmarks like SOFR has significant implications for FRNs. [Market](../m/market.md) participants need to understand these changes and adapt existing contracts to new reference rates.

### Disclosure Requirements

Issuers of FRNs must adhere to strict [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) requirements, providing detailed information about the terms, risks, and [underlying](../u/underlying.md) benchmarks. Regulatory bodies like the U.S. Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) impose these requirements to ensure [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and protect investors.

### Risk Weighting

Banks holding FRNs need to account for them in their [risk-weighted assets](../r/risk-weighted_assets.md). Regulatory [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements may vary based on the [credit](../c/credit.md) quality and [maturity](../m/maturity.md) of the FRNs in their portfolios.

## Conclusion

[Floating Rate Notes](../f/floating_rate_notes.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) unique advantages in managing [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md), providing regular [income](../i/income.md), and diversifying investment portfolios. However, they come with complexities and risks that require careful consideration. As [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) benchmarks evolve, understanding the dynamics of FRNs and their [underlying](../u/underlying.md) reference rates is more critical than ever. Investors and issuers alike must stay informed and responsive to the changing landscape to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on the benefits of [Floating Rate Notes](../f/floating_rate_notes.md). For further detailed and specific information about particular FRNs and their applications, investors can refer to official documents and resources from financial institutions like [JP Morgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com), [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com), and government bodies like the [U.S. Treasury](https://www.treasury.gov).

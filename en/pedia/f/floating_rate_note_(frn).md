# Floating Rate Note (FRN)

A Floating Rate Note (FRN) is a type of bond or debt instrument with a variable interest rate. Unlike fixed-rate bonds that have consistent interest payments throughout their life, the interest payments on FRNs fluctuate, typically in line with benchmark interest rates such as LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), EURIBOR (Euro Interbank Offered Rate), or the Federal Funds Rate. This unique characteristic makes FRNs attractive to investors looking to mitigate interest rate risk, particularly during periods of rising or volatile interest rates.

## Overview

FRNs can be issued by governments, financial institutions, and corporations. They are particularly common in the banking sector. These notes offer a number of advantages and disadvantages that appeal to different types of investors. Understanding the mechanics of FRNs is crucial for making informed investment decisions and managing risk. 

### Structure

The interest rate on an FRN is composed of two components:
1. **Reference Rate:** This is the benchmark interest rate, such as LIBOR, that the FRN's interest payments track.
2. **Spread:** This is an additional amount, stated in basis points, added to the reference rate to calculate the total interest payment. The spread remains constant over the life of the FRN.

For example, if an FRN is pegged to the 3-month LIBOR with a spread of 100 basis points (1%), and the current 3-month LIBOR is 2.5%, the interest rate for the FRN would be 3.5%.

Interest payments are made at regular intervals, commonly quarterly or semi-annually. As the reference rate changes, so does the interest payment amount, allowing the FRN to adapt to market conditions.

### Benefits

**1. Protection Against Interest Rate Risk:**
Since their interest payments adjust with market rates, FRNs offer protection against the risk of rising interest rates, which can erode the value of fixed-rate bonds.

**2. Predictable Spread Over Benchmarks:**
Investors know the spread over the reference rate for the life of the note, providing a degree of predictability while still capturing upward movements in the benchmark rates.

**3. Frequent Payments:**
FRNs often pay interest more frequently than many fixed-rate bonds, making them attractive to investors seeking regular income.

### Risks

**1. Interest Rate Decline:**
When benchmark rates fall, the interest payments on FRNs decline as well, potentially reducing the income to investors.

**2. Complexity:**
The structured nature of FRNs and their reliance on benchmark indices can make them more complex to understand and manage compared to fixed-rate bonds.

**3. Credit Risk:**
As with any bond, there remains the risk that the issuer could default on their payments.

## Types of Floating Rate Notes

FRNs can come in various forms, each tailored to the needs of different issuers and investors.

### Government FRNs

Governments occasionally issue FRNs to finance their activities while managing borrowing costs in line with current interest rates. For instance, the U.S. Treasury began issuing Floating Rate Notes in January 2014, linked to the 13-week Treasury bill auction.

### Corporate FRNs

Corporations issue FRNs to fund operations, acquisitions, or other significant expenditures. These notes provide companies with flexibility in managing interest payments aligned with market conditions.

### Municipal FRNs

Municipalities may issue FRNs to raise funds for public projects. These notes often come with tax advantages, such as tax-exempt interest, making them appealing to certain investors.

## Benchmark Rates

Effective floating rate notes rely on well-established and transparent benchmark rates. The commonly used benchmarks include:

### LIBOR

LIBOR has been the primary reference rate for many FRNs globally. However, due to past manipulation scandals and the transition to more reliable benchmarks, LIBOR is scheduled to be phased out by the end of 2021.

### EURIBOR

The Euro Interbank Offered Rate is used primarily for FRNs issued in euros. EURIBOR operates similarly to LIBOR, providing a benchmark for short-term interbank lending rates within the eurozone.

### Federal Funds Rate

The Federal Funds Rate, set by the Federal Reserve, is a crucial benchmark influencing short-term interest rates in the United States. It's a key reference point for U.S. dollar-denominated FRNs.

### SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate)

As LIBOR phases out, SOFR emerged as a prominent replacement. SOFR is based on overnight repurchase agreement transactions secured by U.S. Treasury securities, offering a more transparent and robust benchmark. The transition to SOFR is an ongoing process, impacting many FRNs traditionally tied to LIBOR.

## Issuance and Trading

FRNs are typically issued at par value (face value) and can be bought and sold in secondary markets. Their prices may fluctuate based on changes in interest rates, credit conditions, and the issuing entity's creditworthiness.

### Primary Market

In the primary market, FRNs are issued directly by the issuer to investors, usually through an underwriting process involving investment banks. The terms of issuance, including the reference rate and spread, are defined in the prospectus.

### Secondary Market

After issuance, FRNs trade in the secondary market among institutional and retail investors. These trades occur on exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or over-the-counter (OTC) markets. The secondary market provides liquidity, allowing investors to buy or sell FRNs before maturity.

### Pricing

The price of an FRN in the secondary market is influenced by:
- Current interest rates: Rising rates can increase the value of an FRN, while falling rates can decrease it.
- Credit quality of the issuer: Changes in the perceived creditworthiness can impact the price.
- Remaining time to maturity: Prices can be affected by the proximity of interest reset dates and the overall time left until maturity.

## Example

Consider a corporation that issues a 5-year FRN with the following terms:
- Reference Rate: 3-month LIBOR
- Spread: 150 basis points (1.5%)

If the 3-month LIBOR is currently 2%, the first quarterly interest payment will be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Interest Payment} = \text{Principal} \times (\text{LIBOR} + \text{Spread}) \]

Assuming a principal amount of $1,000,000:
\[ \text{Interest Payment} = 1,000,000 \times (0.02 + 0.015) = 1,000,000 \times 0.035 = \$35,000 \]

Every three months, the 3-month LIBOR will be reassessed, and the interest payment will adjust accordingly. If, in the subsequent period, the 3-month LIBOR rises to 2.5%, the next interest payment calculation will be:
\[ \text{Interest Payment} = 1,000,000 \times (0.025 + 0.015) = 1,000,000 \times 0.04 = \$40,000 \]

## Applications of Floating Rate Notes

### Portfolio Diversification

FRNs add diversification to an investor's portfolio. Their performance often contrasts with fixed-rate securities, offering balance during fluctuating interest rate environments.

### Hedge Against Inflation

Since FRN interest payments adjust with market rates, they can serve as a hedge against inflation. Rising inflation typically leads to higher interest rates, which in turn increases FRN interest payments.

### Liquidity Management

Institutions like banks use FRNs as part of their liquidity management strategies. Their adjustable rates make them attractive for maintaining optimal levels of liquid assets while still earning interest.

### Risk Management

Corporations and financial institutions may issue FRNs to manage their interest rate exposure. By aligning debt interest payments with variable revenue streams, they can reduce the mismatch between asset and liability durations.

## Regulatory Considerations

The regulatory environment for FRNs is dynamic, with changes impacting both issuers and investors. Key regulatory aspects include:

### Benchmark Reform

The transition from LIBOR to alternative benchmarks like SOFR has significant implications for FRNs. Market participants need to understand these changes and adapt existing contracts to new reference rates.

### Disclosure Requirements

Issuers of FRNs must adhere to strict disclosure requirements, providing detailed information about the terms, risks, and underlying benchmarks. Regulatory bodies like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) impose these requirements to ensure transparency and protect investors.

### Risk Weighting

Banks holding FRNs need to account for them in their risk-weighted assets. Regulatory capital requirements may vary based on the credit quality and maturity of the FRNs in their portfolios.

## Conclusion

Floating Rate Notes offer unique advantages in managing interest rate risk, providing regular income, and diversifying investment portfolios. However, they come with complexities and risks that require careful consideration. As interest rate benchmarks evolve, understanding the dynamics of FRNs and their underlying reference rates is more critical than ever. Investors and issuers alike must stay informed and responsive to the changing landscape to capitalize on the benefits of Floating Rate Notes.

# Full Ratchet

## Definition
A Full Ratchet [anti-dilution provision](../a/anti-dilution_provision.md) is a contractual clause typically found in convertible [security](../s/security.md) agreements or [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md) agreements aimed at protecting investors from [dilution](../d/dilution.md). This [provision](../p/provision.md) ensures that if the company issues new [shares](../s/shares.md) at a price lower than the price originally paid by the initial investors, the conversion price of the original securities is adjusted downwards to match the new lower price. This effectively maintains the [value](../v/value.md) of the original investment, preventing it from being diluted by subsequent funding rounds at lower share prices.

## Mechanics
The Full Ratchet [provision](../p/provision.md) adjusts the conversion price of the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s [shares](../s/shares.md) to the price of the new issuance, allowing them to convert their preferred [shares](../s/shares.md) or convertible notes as if they had paid the lower price for the new [shares](../s/shares.md). To understand the mechanics, let’s delve into the step-by-step process:

1. **Initial Investment**: An [investor](../i/investor.md) buys [convertible preferred stock](../c/convertible_preferred_stock.md) at $10 per share.
2. **New Issuance**: The company issues new [shares](../s/shares.md) at $5 per share.
3. **Adjustment**: The Full Ratchet [provision](../p/provision.md) adjusts the conversion price of the initial [investor](../i/investor.md)’s [shares](../s/shares.md) to $5.
4. **Conversion**: If the initial [investor](../i/investor.md) converts their preferred [shares](../s/shares.md) into [common stock](../c/common_stock.md), they do so at the new lower price, hence getting more [shares](../s/shares.md) than they originally would have, mitigating the [dilution](../d/dilution.md) effect.

## Example Calculation
To clearly illustrate how a Full Ratchet [provision](../p/provision.md) works, consider an initial [investor](../i/investor.md) who buys 1,000 [shares](../s/shares.md) of [convertible preferred stock](../c/convertible_preferred_stock.md) at $10 per share, [investing](../i/investing.md) a total of $10,000. If the company later issues 1,000 new [shares](../s/shares.md) at $5 per share, the new issuance suggests the company is now valuing its [shares](../s/shares.md) at a lower price.

Using the Full Ratchet [provision](../p/provision.md), the [investor](../i/investor.md)’s conversion price adjusts from $10 to $5. Thus, instead of converting their $10,000 investment into 1,000 common [shares](../s/shares.md) ($10,000 / $10), they [will](../w/will.md) now convert it into 2,000 common [shares](../s/shares.md) ($10,000 / $5).

## Comparison with Weighted Average Anti-dilution
In contrast to the Full Ratchet, the [Weighted Average](../w/weighted_average.md) anti-[dilution](../d/dilution.md) method is less severe as it considers both the amount and the price of the new [shares](../s/shares.md) issued. It calculates a [weighted average](../w/weighted_average.md) price for the conversions rather than adjusting entirely to the new issuance price. While a Full Ratchet is more favorable to investors, it can be considered highly punitive from the company’s perspective, possibly discouraging new investors due to its aggressive nature.

## Impact on Companies and Investors
### For Companies
The Full Ratchet [provision](../p/provision.md) can significantly impact a company’s [capital structure](../c/capital_structure.md) and future funding capabilities:

- **[Dilution](../d/dilution.md)**: Subsequent funding rounds at lower valuations can lead to significant [dilution](../d/dilution.md) for founders and other non-protected shareholders.
- **Discourages New Investors**: New investors may be reluctant to invest, knowing existing investors [hold](../h/hold.md) anti-[dilution](../d/dilution.md) protection that could punish them in future down rounds.
- **Funding Strategy**: Companies might be forced to strategize their funding rounds more carefully, balancing the need for [capital](../c/capital.md) with the implications of triggering Full Ratchet provisions.

### For Investors
For investors, a Full Ratchet [provision](../p/provision.md) provides a [robust](../r/robust.md) safety net, maintaining the [value](../v/value.md) of their investment in the company through turbulent [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) or poor company performance.

- **Investment [Security](../s/security.md)**: Investors enjoy heightened [security](../s/security.md) knowing their conversion rights [will](../w/will.md) adjust favorably even if future funding rounds occur at lower valuations.
- **Attractive Term**: This [provision](../p/provision.md) makes an investment more attractive, potentially allowing the company to secure funding under more favorable terms initially.

## Industry Example
A notable instance of anti-[dilution](../d/dilution.md) provisions’ impact is seen in many [venture capital](../v/venture_capital.md) environments. For example, if a [startup](../s/startup.md) raises funds at a high [valuation](../v/valuation.md) but performs poorly, leading to a [down round](../d/down_round.md), the initial investors with Full Ratchet provisions are shielded effectively from [dilution](../d/dilution.md).

A practical case could be imaginary company XYZ Corp. In its Series A funding, investors paid $10 per share. Subsequently, due to performance issues, XYZ Corp might raise a Series B round at $5 per share. Series A investors [will](../w/will.md) then have their conversion price adjusted to $5, protecting their interests. However, this protection could make it harder for XYZ Corp to attract new investment, knowing the punitive adjustment in store for future investors.

## Legal and Contractual Aspects
Implementing Full Ratchet provisions requires careful [negotiation](../n/negotiation.md) and clear legal articulation within the stock purchase agreement or the convertible [note](../n/note.md) agreement. Legal counsel needs to ensure both the company and the investors understand the implications, and the [provision](../p/provision.md) is drafted in compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations.

Key points usually covered include:
- **Trigger Events**: Clearly defining what constitutes a trigger for the [provision](../p/provision.md).
- **Adjustments**: Mechanisms for adjusting the conversion prices and [shares](../s/shares.md).
- **Notifications**: [Obligations](../o/obligation.md) on the company to notify investors of new issuances and adjusted prices.
- **Limitations**: Any agreed limitations on the [provision](../p/provision.md)’s applicability.

## Conclusion
A Full Ratchet [anti-dilution provision](../a/anti-dilution_provision.md) is a potent protective mechanism for investors, ensuring their investment retains [value](../v/value.md) even in adverse [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md) or company downturns. However, it represents a double-edged sword for companies, influencing their [capital](../c/capital.md) raising strategy and future investment appeal. Properly balancing these interests is crucial for both parties in the [negotiation](../n/negotiation.md) process.

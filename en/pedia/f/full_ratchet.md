# Full Ratchet

## Definition
A Full Ratchet anti-dilution provision is a contractual clause typically found in convertible security agreements or preferred stock agreements aimed at protecting investors from dilution. This provision ensures that if the company issues new shares at a price lower than the price originally paid by the initial investors, the conversion price of the original securities is adjusted downwards to match the new lower price. This effectively maintains the value of the original investment, preventing it from being diluted by subsequent funding rounds at lower share prices.

## Mechanics
The Full Ratchet provision adjusts the conversion price of the investor's shares to the price of the new issuance, allowing them to convert their preferred shares or convertible notes as if they had paid the lower price for the new shares. To understand the mechanics, let’s delve into the step-by-step process:

1. **Initial Investment**: An investor buys convertible preferred stock at $10 per share.
2. **New Issuance**: The company issues new shares at $5 per share.
3. **Adjustment**: The Full Ratchet provision adjusts the conversion price of the initial investor’s shares to $5.
4. **Conversion**: If the initial investor converts their preferred shares into common stock, they do so at the new lower price, hence getting more shares than they originally would have, mitigating the dilution effect.

## Example Calculation
To clearly illustrate how a Full Ratchet provision works, consider an initial investor who buys 1,000 shares of convertible preferred stock at $10 per share, investing a total of $10,000. If the company later issues 1,000 new shares at $5 per share, the new issuance suggests the company is now valuing its shares at a lower price.

Using the Full Ratchet provision, the investor’s conversion price adjusts from $10 to $5. Thus, instead of converting their $10,000 investment into 1,000 common shares ($10,000 / $10), they will now convert it into 2,000 common shares ($10,000 / $5).

## Comparison with Weighted Average Anti-dilution
In contrast to the Full Ratchet, the Weighted Average anti-dilution method is less severe as it considers both the amount and the price of the new shares issued. It calculates a weighted average price for the conversions rather than adjusting entirely to the new issuance price. While a Full Ratchet is more favorable to investors, it can be considered highly punitive from the company’s perspective, possibly discouraging new investors due to its aggressive nature.

## Impact on Companies and Investors
### For Companies
The Full Ratchet provision can significantly impact a company’s capital structure and future funding capabilities:

- **Dilution**: Subsequent funding rounds at lower valuations can lead to significant dilution for founders and other non-protected shareholders.
- **Discourages New Investors**: New investors may be reluctant to invest, knowing existing investors hold anti-dilution protection that could punish them in future down rounds.
- **Funding Strategy**: Companies might be forced to strategize their funding rounds more carefully, balancing the need for capital with the implications of triggering Full Ratchet provisions.

### For Investors
For investors, a Full Ratchet provision provides a robust safety net, maintaining the value of their investment in the company through turbulent financial markets or poor company performance.

- **Investment Security**: Investors enjoy heightened security knowing their conversion rights will adjust favorably even if future funding rounds occur at lower valuations.
- **Attractive Term**: This provision makes an investment more attractive, potentially allowing the company to secure funding under more favorable terms initially.

## Industry Example
A notable instance of anti-dilution provisions’ impact is seen in many venture capital environments. For example, if a startup raises funds at a high valuation but performs poorly, leading to a down round, the initial investors with Full Ratchet provisions are shielded effectively from dilution.

A practical case could be imaginary company XYZ Corp. In its Series A funding, investors paid $10 per share. Subsequently, due to performance issues, XYZ Corp might raise a Series B round at $5 per share. Series A investors will then have their conversion price adjusted to $5, protecting their interests. However, this protection could make it harder for XYZ Corp to attract new investment, knowing the punitive adjustment in store for future investors.

## Legal and Contractual Aspects
Implementing Full Ratchet provisions requires careful negotiation and clear legal articulation within the stock purchase agreement or the convertible note agreement. Legal counsel needs to ensure both the company and the investors understand the implications, and the provision is drafted in compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations.

Key points usually covered include:
- **Trigger Events**: Clearly defining what constitutes a trigger for the provision.
- **Adjustments**: Mechanisms for adjusting the conversion prices and shares.
- **Notifications**: Obligations on the company to notify investors of new issuances and adjusted prices.
- **Limitations**: Any agreed limitations on the provision’s applicability.

## Conclusion
A Full Ratchet anti-dilution provision is a potent protective mechanism for investors, ensuring their investment retains value even in adverse economic conditions or company downturns. However, it represents a double-edged sword for companies, influencing their capital raising strategy and future investment appeal. Properly balancing these interests is crucial for both parties in the negotiation process.

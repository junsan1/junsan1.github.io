# Form 1098

## Introduction

Form 1098, also known as the [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [Interest](../i/interest.md) Statement, is an Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Service (IRS) tax form used in the United States. It is issued by lenders to report the amount of [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [interest](../i/interest.md), [mortgage insurance](../m/mortgage_insurance.md) premiums, and points paid by a borrower over the course of a tax year. This form is crucial for both the [lender](../l/lender.md) and the borrower, as it allows the borrower to potentially deduct the amounts reported on their [tax return](../t/tax_return.md), thereby reducing their [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md).

## Purpose of Form 1098

The main purpose of Form 1098 is to provide the IRS and the borrower with accurate information regarding the [interest](../i/interest.md) paid on a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md). This form helps ensure that proper tax deductions can be taken by the borrower, which can significantly impact their tax liabilities. The information reported on Form 1098 includes:

- [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) received from the borrower
- [Mortgage insurance](../m/mortgage_insurance.md) premiums
- Points paid on the purchase of the property
- Refunds of overpaid [interest](../i/interest.md)

### Mortgage Interest

[Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) is the amount of [interest](../i/interest.md) charged on a [loan](../l/loan.md) used to purchase a [home](../h/home.md) or [refinance](../r/refinance.md) an existing [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md). It is often the largest tax-deductible [expense](../e/expense.md) for homeowners. By reporting [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) on Form 1098, lenders provide borrowers with the necessary documentation to claim this [deduction](../d/deduction.md) on their annual tax returns.

### Mortgage Insurance Premiums

[Mortgage insurance](../m/mortgage_insurance.md) premiums are payments made to insure a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md), protecting the [lender](../l/lender.md) in case the borrower defaults on the [loan](../l/loan.md). These premiums may also be deductible, depending on the borrower's adjusted [gross income](../g/gross_income.md) (AGI) and the tax year in question. The amount of [mortgage insurance](../m/mortgage_insurance.md) premiums paid by the borrower is also reported on Form 1098.

### Points

Points, also known as [loan](../l/loan.md) [origination](../o/origination.md) fees or [discount](../d/discount.md) points, are upfront payments made by the borrower to reduce the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) on a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md). Points can be either deductible in the year they are paid or amortized over the life of the [loan](../l/loan.md), depending on the specific circumstances. Form 1098 includes information on points paid, helping borrowers determine their potential deductions.

### Refunds of Overpaid Interest

If a borrower overpays [interest](../i/interest.md) on their [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md), the [lender](../l/lender.md) may [issue](../i/issue.md) a refund. This refund must also be reported on Form 1098, ensuring that the borrower and IRS have accurate records of the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) paid during the tax year.

## Who Must File Form 1098

Lenders, including banks, [credit](../c/credit.md) unions, [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) companies, and other financial institutions, must file Form 1098 if they receive $600 or more in [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) from a borrower during the tax year. This $600 threshold applies to the total amount of [interest](../i/interest.md) received, not the outstanding [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) balance or [principal](../p/principal.md) amount.

### Filing Requirements for Lenders

Lenders must provide a copy of Form 1098 to both the borrower and the IRS. This can be done either electronically or by mail. The deadline for furnishing Form 1098 to the borrower is January 31 of the year following the tax year, while the deadline for filing with the IRS is February 28 (or March 31 if filing electronically).

### Reporting Multiple Loans

If a borrower has [multiple](../m/multiple.md) mortgages with the same [lender](../l/lender.md), the [lender](../l/lender.md) must report each [loan](../l/loan.md) separately on Form 1098. This ensures that the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [interest](../i/interest.md), points, and [mortgage insurance](../m/mortgage_insurance.md) premiums are accurately reported for each individual [loan](../l/loan.md).

## How to Read Form 1098

Understanding the information on Form 1098 is essential for borrowers to accurately claim deductions on their tax returns. The form contains several key sections, including:

- **Payer's/Borrower's Information**: This section includes the [lender](../l/lender.md)'s and borrower's names, addresses, and [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) identification numbers (TINs).
- **[Account Number](../a/account_number.md)**: The unique [account number](../a/account_number.md) assigned to the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) by the [lender](../l/lender.md).
- **[Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [Interest](../i/interest.md) Received**: The total amount of [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) received by the [lender](../l/lender.md) from the borrower during the tax year.
- **Outstanding [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [Principal](../p/principal.md)**: The remaining [principal](../p/principal.md) balance on the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) as of January 1 of the tax year.
- **[Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [Origination](../o/origination.md) Date**: The date the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) was originated.
- **Points Paid on Purchase of [Principal](../p/principal.md) Residence**: The total amount of points paid by the borrower on the purchase of their [principal](../p/principal.md) residence.

- **Refund of Overpaid [Interest](../i/interest.md)**: The total amount of any refunds issued to the borrower for overpaid [interest](../i/interest.md).

## Importance of Form 1098 for Borrowers

For borrowers, Form 1098 is a vital document for accurately preparing their annual tax returns. The information reported on this form can significantly impact their [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md) and overall [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md). By properly reporting [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [interest](../i/interest.md), points, and [mortgage insurance](../m/mortgage_insurance.md) premiums, borrowers can potentially reduce their tax burden.

### Claiming Mortgage Interest Deduction

To claim the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) [deduction](../d/deduction.md), borrowers must itemize their deductions using Schedule A (Form 1040). The amount of [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) reported on Form 1098 is then entered on line 8a of Schedule A. This [deduction](../d/deduction.md) can result in significant tax savings, particularly for borrowers with large [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) balances and high-[interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

### Deducting Mortgage Insurance Premiums

[Mortgage insurance](../m/mortgage_insurance.md) premiums may be deductible as [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) on Schedule A, subject to certain [income](../i/income.md) limitations. Borrowers with an AGI of $109,000 or less can generally deduct their [mortgage insurance](../m/mortgage_insurance.md) premiums in full, while those with an AGI between $100,000 and $109,000 may be eligible for a partial [deduction](../d/deduction.md). The amount of [mortgage insurance](../m/mortgage_insurance.md) premiums reported on Form 1098 is entered on line 8d of Schedule A.

### Deducting Points

Points paid on the purchase of a [principal](../p/principal.md) residence may be deductible in the year they are paid, provided certain conditions are met. To claim this [deduction](../d/deduction.md), borrowers must enter the amount of points reported on Form 1098 on line 8c of Schedule A. If the points do not meet the IRS criteria for immediate [deduction](../d/deduction.md), they must be amortized over the life of the [loan](../l/loan.md).

### Reporting Refunds of Overpaid Interest

If a borrower receives a refund of overpaid [interest](../i/interest.md), this amount must be subtracted from the total [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) [deduction](../d/deduction.md) claimed on Schedule A. By accurately reporting refunds of overpaid [interest](../i/interest.md), borrowers can avoid potential issues with the IRS.

## Common Issues and Tips

While Form 1098 is essential for accurately claiming [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-related deductions, borrowers may encounter some common issues. Here are a few tips to help navigate these challenges:

### Verify Information

Borrowers should carefully review the information on Form 1098 to ensure it is accurate. This includes verifying the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [interest](../i/interest.md), points, and [mortgage insurance](../m/mortgage_insurance.md) premiums reported by the [lender](../l/lender.md). Any discrepancies should be promptly addressed with the [lender](../l/lender.md) to avoid potential issues with the IRS.

### Consult with a Tax Professional

Due to the complexities of tax laws and [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-related deductions, borrowers may benefit from consulting with a tax professional. A qualified tax advisor can help ensure that deductions are accurately claimed and that the borrower maximizes their tax savings.

### Update Address Information

To ensure timely receipt of Form 1098, borrowers should keep their address information up to date with their [lender](../l/lender.md). This helps avoid delays in receiving the form and allows for accurate [tax return](../t/tax_return.md) preparation.

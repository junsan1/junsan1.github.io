# Fortune 100

The Fortune 100 is a list compiled and published annually by Fortune magazine that ranks the top 100 American companies by their gross revenue. This ranking serves as a segment of the larger Fortune 500 list, which includes the top 500 corporations in the United States. The Fortune 100 list offers a snapshot of the most successful, influential, and economically robust companies in the country. The firms on the Fortune 100 are primarily recognized for their size, but they also set industry standards and trends. This list is widely regarded as a prestigious benchmark of corporate success and influence.

The Fortune 100 features companies from a diverse range of industries, including technology, manufacturing, retail, finance, and healthcare. These companies not only play a pivotal role in the U.S. economy but also have a significant impact on the global market. As of the most recent list, the top companies often include names such as Walmart, Amazon, Apple, ExxonMobil, and Berkshire Hathaway.

## Historical Context

The Fortune 100 list was first published in 1955. Over the years, the composition of the list has evolved, reflecting the changing landscape of the American and global economies. In the mid-20th century, the list was dominated by industrial manufacturing giants like General Motors, Ford, and General Electric. However, as the economy shifted towards services and technology, new players emerged, particularly in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.

The arrival of companies such as Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet (Google) on the list marks a significant shift from manufacturing to technology and digital services as the drivers of economic profit and growth.

## Criteria and Methodology

The ranking on the Fortune 100 list is primarily based on total revenue figures. The revenue figures are typically for the fiscal year ending on or around December 31 of the preceding year. Fortune collects this data from public financial statements and company reports. The methodology includes:

1. **Revenue**: The total revenue generated by the company from its various business activities.
2. **Net Income**: The companyâ€™s profit after all expenses have been deducted from total revenue.
3. **Market Value**: The total market capitalization of the company, although this is more prominently featured in lists such as the Fortune 500.
4. **Employee Numbers**: While not directly affecting the ranking, Fortune also considers the number of employees as an auxiliary metric.
5. **Historical Performance**: The historical performance and growth trajectory can influence future estimates, though it does not directly alter current ranking.

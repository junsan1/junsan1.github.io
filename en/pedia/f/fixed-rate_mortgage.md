# Fixed-Rate Mortgage

A fixed-rate [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) (FRM) is a popular type of [home](../h/home.md) [loan](../l/loan.md) with a set [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) that remains [unchanged](../u/unchanged.md) for the entire term of the [loan](../l/loan.md). This distinctive feature makes it a preferred choice for borrowers seeking stability and predictability in their monthly [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) payments.

## Key Characteristics

### Interest Rate
- **[Fixed Interest Rate](../f/fixed_interest_rate.md)**: The [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) on a fixed-rate [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) does not fluctuate with changes in [market](../m/market.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. It is determined at the time of [loan](../l/loan.md) [origination](../o/origination.md) and remains constant throughout the [loan](../l/loan.md) period.
- **Competitive Rates**: While initial [interest](../i/interest.md) rates on fixed-rate mortgages may be higher than those of adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), they [offer](../o/offer.md) long-term peace of mind.

### Loan Term
Fixed-rate mortgages typically come in varying terms, with the most common being 15, 20, and 30 years. Each term has different implications for monthly payments and the total [interest](../i/interest.md) paid over the life of the [loan](../l/loan.md).
- **30-Year FRM**: Popular for its lower monthly payments, making homeownership more affordable for many borrowers. However, it results in higher total [interest](../i/interest.md) payments.
- **15-Year FRM**: Offers lower total [interest](../i/interest.md) costs and quicker [loan](../l/loan.md) payoff. Monthly payments are higher compared to longer terms.
- **20-Year FRM**: Provides a middle ground between 15 and 30-year terms, balancing monthly [payment](../p/payment.md) size and total [interest](../i/interest.md) costs.

### Monthly Payments
- **Consistent Payments**: Homeowners with a fixed-rate [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) benefit from predictable monthly payments, which consist of both [principal](../p/principal.md) and [interest](../i/interest.md) portions.
- **Ease of Budgeting**: The stability of payments simplifies [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md) and budgeting, as borrowers can anticipate their housing costs without worrying about fluctuating rates.

### Amortization
Fixed-rate mortgages are fully amortizing loans. This means each monthly [payment](../p/payment.md) gradually reduces the [principal](../p/principal.md) balance, and the [loan](../l/loan.md) is fully paid off at the end of the term.
- **[Amortization Schedule](../a/amortization.md)**: Lenders provide an [amortization schedule](../a/amortization.md) that outlines the breakdown of [principal](../p/principal.md) and [interest](../i/interest.md) payments over the life of the [loan](../l/loan.md).
- **[Equity](../e/equity.md) Building**: As [principal](../p/principal.md) payments increase over time, homeowners build [equity](../e/equity.md) in their property.

## Advantages of Fixed-Rate Mortgages

### Predictability
- **Stable Payments**: The main advantage is the predictability of [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) payments, shielding borrowers from [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) fluctuations.
- **[Financial Planning](../f/financial_planning.md)**: This stability allows for better long-term [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md) and budgeting.

### Long-term Savings
- **[Interest Rate](../i/interest_rate.md) Lock**: Borrowers lock in today's rates, which can be advantageous if [interest](../i/interest.md) rates rise in the future, potentially leading to long-term savings.

### Simplicity
- **Understandable Terms**: Fixed-rate mortgages are straightforward, making them easier for borrowers to understand.
- **No Rate Shock**: Borrowers avoid the [risk](../r/risk.md) of sudden [payment](../p/payment.md) increases that can occur with adjustable-rate mortgages.

## Disadvantages of Fixed-Rate Mortgages

### Higher Initial Rates
- **Comparatively Higher Rates**: Fixed-rate mortgages often start with higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates than adjustable-rate mortgages, resulting in higher initial monthly payments.

### Limited Flexibility
- **No Adjustments**: The inability to adjust the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) may be a drawback if [market](../m/market.md) rates decline significantly.
- **[Prepayment](../p/prepayment.md) Penalties**: Some lenders may impose penalties for paying off the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) early, though this is less common with modern [loan](../l/loan.md) products.

## Comparative Analysis with Adjustable-Rate Mortgages (ARMs)

Fixed-rate mortgages are often compared to adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) to help borrowers make informed decisions. Key comparative points include:

### Stability vs. Flexibility
- **Fixed-Rate [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) (FRM)**:
  - Offers rate stability and predictable payments.
  - Higher initial rates but long-term savings in a rising rate environment.
- **Adjustable-Rate [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) (ARM)**:
  - Initially lower rates, which can adjust periodically based on [market](../m/market.md) conditions.
  - Potential for rate increases leading to higher payments and [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md).

### Suitability
- **FRM**: Suitable for [risk-averse](../r/risk-averse.md) borrowers who plan to stay in their [home](../h/home.md) for an extended period.
- **ARM**: May be beneficial for borrowers expecting to sell or [refinance](../r/refinance.md) before the rate adjusts.

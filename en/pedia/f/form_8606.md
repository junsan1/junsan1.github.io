# Form 8606

Form 8606, also known as the "Nondeductible IRAs" form, is a crucial document for individuals participating in certain types of retirement accounts. This form must be filed alongside your [tax return](../t/tax_return.md) to report contributions to non-deductible traditional IRAs, conversions from traditional IRAs to Roth IRAs, and distributions from Roth IRAs. Detailed knowledge of this form is essential for accurate tax reporting and to avoid potential penalties or excess [taxation](../t/taxation.md). Below, we'll delve into its specific sections, filing requirements, and the implications of not properly reporting transactions related to IRAs.

## What is Form 8606?

Form 8606 is used by taxpayers to track their non-deductible contributions to traditional IRAs, report conversions from traditional to Roth IRAs (backdoor Roth conversions), and [Roth IRA](../r/roth_ira.md) distributions. Contributions to a [traditional IRA](../t/traditional_ira.md) are typically deductible on your [tax return](../t/tax_return.md), but if you or your spouse is covered by a retirement plan at work and your [income](../i/income.md) exceeds certain levels, your ability to deduct contributions may be limited or eliminated. In these cases, the contributions are non-deductible.

Filing Form 8606 helps to ensure that you do not pay [taxes](../t/taxes.md) again on the portion of your [traditional IRA](../t/traditional_ira.md) distributions that represent non-deductible contributions. Additionally, it is required to calculate the taxable portion of a [Roth IRA](../r/roth_ira.md) conversion and to report [Roth IRA](../r/roth_ira.md) distributions.

## Importance of Form 8606

Filing Form 8606 correctly is critical for several reasons:

- **Prevent [Double Taxation](../d/double_taxation.md)**: Ensure that non-deductible contributions are not taxed again when distributions are taken.
- **Accurate Tax Reporting**: Report and calculate [taxes](../t/taxes.md) owed on Roth conversions accurately.
- **Avoid Penalties**: Prevent IRS penalties due to inaccurate reporting or failure to file.

## When is Form 8606 Required?

You must file Form 8606 if any of the following situations apply:

- You made non-deductible contributions to your [traditional IRA](../t/traditional_ira.md).
- You received distributions from a [traditional IRA](../t/traditional_ira.md), SEP IRA, or SIMPLE IRA and you have [cost basis](../c/cost_basis.md) (i.e., you have made non-deductible contributions to any of these IRAs).
- You converted an amount from your [traditional IRA](../t/traditional_ira.md), SEP IRA, or SIMPLE IRA to your [Roth IRA](../r/roth_ira.md).
- You received distributions from a [Roth IRA](../r/roth_ira.md).

## Breakdown of Form 8606 Sections

### Part I: Nondeductible Contributions to Traditional IRAs and Distributions

This section is used to report nondeductible contributions made to traditional IRAs. It includes lines to calculate the total [basis](../b/basis.md) (total nondeductible contributions) and to determine the taxable and non-taxable portions of any [traditional IRA](../t/traditional_ira.md) distributions you received.

Key lines in this section include:

- **Line 1**: Total nondeductible contributions for the year.
- **Line 2**: Total [basis](../b/basis.md) in traditional IRAs.
- **Line 7**: Non-taxable portion of distributions.

### Part II: Conversions from Traditional, SEP, or SIMPLE IRAs to Roth IRAs

This section captures details of any IRA conversions. When you convert a [traditional IRA](../t/traditional_ira.md) to a [Roth IRA](../r/roth_ira.md), the converted amount is generally taxable, and this section helps calculate the taxable portion.

Key lines in this section include:

- **Line 16**: Total conversions from traditional, SEP, and SIMPLE IRAs to Roth IRAs.
- **Line 18**: Taxable amount of the conversion.

### Part III: Distributions from Roth IRAs

This section is used to report distributions from Roth IRAs and to determine if any part of the [distribution](../d/distribution.md) is taxable. Generally, qualified [Roth IRA](../r/roth_ira.md) distributions are [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md), but non-qualified distributions may be subject to [taxes](../t/taxes.md) and penalties.

Key lines in this section include:

- **Line 19**: Total distributions from Roth IRAs.
- **Line 22**: Taxable amount of distributions.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Filing Form 8606 can be complex, and there are several common errors to avoid:

- **Incorrect [Basis](../b/basis.md) Calculation**: Failing to accurately track and report the [basis](../b/basis.md) in traditional IRAs can result in paying [taxes](../t/taxes.md) twice on the same [income](../i/income.md).
- **Omitting Conversions**: Not reporting Roth conversions properly.
- **Incorrect [Distribution](../d/distribution.md) Reporting**: Misreporting [Roth IRA](../r/roth_ira.md) distributions can lead to unexpected [taxes](../t/taxes.md) and penalties.

## Proper Record Keeping

Maintaining accurate records is crucial for correctly filing Form 8606. You should:

- Keep records of all IRA contributions, including whether they were deductible or non-deductible.
- Retain records of conversions and distributions.
- Ensure prior Form 8606 filings are kept for reference, as the [basis](../b/basis.md) in your IRAs carries forward each year.

## Filing the Form

Form 8606 should be filed with your individual [tax return](../t/tax_return.md) (Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR). If you need to file it separately, send it to the address where you would otherwise file your Form 1040.

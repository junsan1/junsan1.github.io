# Follow On Public Offer (FPO)

A Follow On Public [Offer](../o/offer.md) (FPO) is a process by which a publicly traded company issues additional [shares](../s/shares.md) to investors after its initial public [offering](../o/offering.md) (IPO). This method is leveraged by companies primarily to raise additional [capital](../c/capital.md) from the public. The raised funds can be used for various purposes such as [clearing](../c/clearing.md) debts, expanding businesses, or launching new projects. 

## Differences Between FPO and IPO

While both IPOs and FPOs involve companies [offering](../o/offering.md) their [shares](../s/shares.md) to the public, there are some key differences:

- **Purpose**: An IPO introduces a company to the public [market](../m/market.md) with the aim of raising initial [capital](../c/capital.md). FPO, on the other hand, is aimed at raising additional funds once the company is already public.
- **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Level**: IPOs are often considered more risky because the company’s performance in the public [market](../m/market.md) is still uncertain. FPOs are generally less risky since the company is already public and has a [market](../m/market.md) history.
- **Pricing**: In an IPO, the price is usually set based on evaluation by underwriters and [market](../m/market.md) conditions. In FPOs, the price is usually [market](../m/market.md) determined and can fluctuate more because the company is already publicly traded.

## Types of FPO

There are two primary types of FPOs:

1. **Dilutive [Follow-on Offering](../f/follow-on_offering.md)**: In this type, new [shares](../s/shares.md) are issued, leading to a [dilution](../d/dilution.md) of [earnings](../e/earnings.md) per share (EPS) since the total number of [shares](../s/shares.md) increases. This usually results in a decrease in the share price in the short term. The [capital](../c/capital.md) raised from such [offering](../o/offering.md) is typically used for paying off [debt](../d/debt.md) or [investing](../i/investing.md) in new ventures.

2. **Non-Dilutive [Follow-on Offering](../f/follow-on_offering.md)**: This involves the [sale](../s/sale.md) of [shares](../s/shares.md) that are already existing. Usually, large shareholders, like directors of the company or other [pre-IPO](../p/pre-ipo.md) investors, sell their own [shares](../s/shares.md) to the public. Since no new [shares](../s/shares.md) are issued, there is no [dilution](../d/dilution.md) of the EPS. 

## Mechanism of an FPO

The process of an FPO involves several steps:

- **Board Approval**: The company's board of directors must first approve the FPO.
- **Regulatory Filing**: The company then needs to file required documents with the relevant regulatory authority (like the SEC in the United States).
- **Pricing**: The company must decide on the [offering price](../o/offering_price.md), often guided by investment bankers.
- **[Marketing](../m/marketing.md)**: The company typically conducts roadshows and other [marketing](../m/marketing.md) activities to attract investors.
- **[Book Building](../b/book_building.md)**: [Investment banks](../i/investment_bank_(ib).md) help gather [investor](../i/investor.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) and determine [demand](../d/demand.md) for the [shares](../s/shares.md) at various price levels.
- **[Allotment](../a/allotment.md)**: Based on the [demand](../d/demand.md), [shares](../s/shares.md) are then allotted to investors.
- **Listing**: The newly [issued shares](../i/issued_shares.md) are [listed](../l/listed.md) on the stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md) and become tradable.

## Advantages of FPOs

- **[Capital](../c/capital.md) Access**: Companies can raise additional [capital](../c/capital.md) which can be utilized to pay off debts, invest in new projects, or for general corporate purposes.
- **Lower [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: FPOs usually pose lower [risk](../r/risk.md) as the company has a track record in the [market](../m/market.md).
- **Opportunity for Public Investors**: Public investors get another chance to invest in the company, possibly at a different price point than the IPO.

## Disadvantages of FPOs

- **[Dilution](../d/dilution.md)**: For dilutive FPOs, the issuance of new [shares](../s/shares.md) dilutes the ownership stake of existing shareholders.
- **Cost**: The process of conducting an FPO involves costs related to [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md), legal, and [administrative expenses](../a/administrative_expenses.md).
- **Price Pressure**: The introduction of additional [shares](../s/shares.md) can lead to downward pressure on the stock price due to increased [supply](../s/supply.md).

## Case Examples

### Facebook's FPO (2013)

One of the well-known examples of an FPO is Facebook’s [follow-on offering](../f/follow-on_offering.md) in December 2013. Facebook issued an additional 70 million [shares](../s/shares.md) to the public, raising about $3.9 billion. This allowed the company to ensure more [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and use the funds for corporate purposes.

### Tesla's FPO (2020)

Another significant example is that of Tesla's [follow-on offering](../f/follow-on_offering.md) in 2020. Tesla raised $2 billion through this [offering](../o/offering.md) by selling 2.65 million [shares](../s/shares.md). The funds raised were primarily for general corporate purposes and strengthening their [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md).

## Conclusion

Follow On Public Offers are a vital tool for publicly traded companies to raise additional funds. They [offer](../o/offer.md) an opportunity for companies to access more [capital](../c/capital.md) and manage their [equity](../e/equity.md) structure efficiently. However, it is crucial to consider the potential dilutive effects and [market](../m/market.md) perception when executing an FPO. Although generally less risky than IPOs, FPOs must be carefully planned and executed to achieve the desired outcomes.

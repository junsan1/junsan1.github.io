# Four Asian Tigers

The Four Asian Tigers, also known as the Asian Dragons or Four Little Dragons, refer to the highly developed economies of Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. These regions have experienced rapid [industrialization](../i/industrialization.md) and exceptional [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) rates, particularly between the 1960s and 1990s, propelling them from developing to high-[income](../i/income.md) developed economies. This analysis provides a comprehensive examination of the economic strategies, growth trajectories, and current status of these distinct but interconnected regions.

## Hong Kong

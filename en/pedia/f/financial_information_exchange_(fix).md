# Financial Information Exchange (FIX)

## Overview

The Financial Information Exchange (FIX) protocol is a standard electronic communications protocol initiated in 1992 for international real-time exchange of information related to securities transactions and markets. Originally developed by a group of financial institutions, the protocol has since become integral to the financial industry's trading, pre-trading, and post-trading processes, enabling market participants across the globe to communicate efficiently.

## History and Evolution

The FIX protocol was conceived to streamline the cumbersome and error-prone communication methods between buy-side firms and sell-side firms. Initially developed by Fidelity Investments and Salomon Brothers, the protocol has grown into a robust and widely adopted standard facilitated by the non-profit organization FIX Protocol Ltd.

### Key Milestones

2. **1998**: Creation of FIX Protocol Ltd. to oversee the growth and development of the protocol.
3. **2001**: Release of FIX 4.4, which became the industry's workhorse version for many years.
4. **2006**: Guidelines for using FIX for post-trade processing were introduced.

## Functional Areas

1. **Order Management**: Sending and receiving orders between buy-side firms and sell-side firms.

3. **Post-Trade Processing**: Facilitating the confirmation, allocation, and settlement of trades.
4. **Market Data**: Distributing real-time market data, including bid/ask prices and trade reporting.

## Message Types

The FIX protocol operates using various message types that cater to distinct trading functions. Each message type is defined by a unique tag.

1. **New Order - Single (D)**: Initiates a single order request.
2. **Execution Report (8)**: Provides execution details for trades.
3. **Order Cancel Request (F)**: Requests the cancellation of an existing order.
4. **Market Data Snapshot/Full Refresh (W)**: Provides a snapshot of the market data.
5. **Order Mass Status Request (AF)**: Requests the status of multiple orders.

## Message Structure

FIX messages consist of three parts:

1. **Header**: Contains information pertinent to the communication, like the protocol version, sequence number, and message type identifier.
2. **Body**: Contains the actual content of the message, such as order details, execution reports, or market data.
3. **Trailer**: Ensures message integrity, typically including the checksum.

Each element in a FIX message is identified by a tag number, followed by a value, and separated by a delimiter known as the "SOH" (Start Of Header) character.

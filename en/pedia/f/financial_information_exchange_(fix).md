# Financial Information Exchange (FIX)

## Overview

The Financial Information [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (FIX) protocol is a standard electronic communications protocol initiated in 1992 for international real-time [exchange](../e/exchange.md) of information related to securities transactions and markets. Originally developed by a group of financial institutions, the protocol has since become integral to the financial [industry](../i/industry.md)'s trading, pre-trading, and post-trading processes, enabling [market](../m/market.md) participants across the globe to communicate efficiently.

## History and Evolution

The FIX protocol was conceived to streamline the cumbersome and error-prone communication methods between [buy-side](../b/buy-side.md) firms and [sell-side](../s/sell-side.md) firms. Initially developed by [Fidelity Investments](../f/fidelity_investments.md) and Salomon Brothers, the protocol has grown into a [robust](../r/robust.md) and widely adopted standard facilitated by the non-[profit](../p/profit.md) organization FIX Protocol Ltd.

### Key Milestones

1. **1992**: Initial development by [Fidelity Investments](../f/fidelity_investments.md) and Salomon Brothers.
2. **1998**: Creation of FIX Protocol Ltd. to oversee the growth and development of the protocol.
3. **2001**: Release of FIX 4.4, which became the [industry](../i/industry.md)'s workhorse version for many years.
4. **2006**: Guidelines for using FIX for [post-trade processing](../p/post-trade_processing.md) were introduced.
5. **2014**: Introduction of FIX 5.0 Service Pack 2, addressing [post-trade processing](../p/post-trade_processing.md), regulatory reporting, and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md).

## Functional Areas

1. **[Order Management](../o/order_management_in_trading.md)**: Sending and receiving orders between [buy-side](../b/buy-side.md) firms and [sell-side](../s/sell-side.md) firms.
2. **Pre-[Trade](../t/trade.md) [Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Monitoring and evaluating [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) before the [execution](../e/execution.md) of trades.
3. **[Post-Trade Processing](../p/post-trade_processing.md)**: Facilitating the confirmation, allocation, and settlement of trades.
4. **[Market](../m/market.md) Data**: Distributing [real-time market data](../r/real-time_market_data.md), including [bid](../b/bid.md)/ask prices and [trade](../t/trade.md) reporting.

## Message Types

The FIX protocol operates using various message types that cater to distinct trading functions. Each message type is defined by a unique tag.

1. **New [Order](../o/order.md) - Single (D)**: Initiates a single [order](../o/order.md) request.
2. **[Execution](../e/execution.md) Report (8)**: Provides [execution](../e/execution.md) details for trades.
3. **[Order](../o/order.md) Cancel Request (F)**: Requests the cancellation of an existing [order](../o/order.md).
4. **[Market](../m/market.md) Data Snapshot/Full Refresh (W)**: Provides a snapshot of the [market](../m/market.md) data.
5. **[Order](../o/order.md) Mass Status Request (AF)**: Requests the status of [multiple](../m/multiple.md) orders.

## Message Structure

FIX messages consist of three parts:

1. **Header**: Contains information pertinent to the communication, like the protocol version, sequence number, and message type identifier.
2. **Body**: Contains the actual content of the message, such as [order](../o/order.md) details, [execution](../e/execution.md) reports, or [market](../m/market.md) data.
3. **Trailer**: Ensures message integrity, typically including the checksum.

Each element in a FIX message is identified by a tag number, followed by a [value](../v/value.md), and separated by a delimiter known as the "SOH" (Start Of Header) character.

## Adoption and Usage

### Market Participants

FIX is widely utilized by various [market](../m/market.md) participants, including:

1. **[Broker](../b/broker.md)-Dealers**: Execute transactions on behalf of clients.

3. **Exchanges and ECNs**: Provide trading platforms.
4. **Service Providers**: [Offer](../o/offer.md) trading technologies and solutions.

# Futures Term Structure

The term structure of [futures](../f/futures.md) refers to the relationship between the prices of [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) and the differing [maturity](../m/maturity.md) dates for these contracts. Essentially, it is the curve created when plotting the prices of [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) against their respective expiration dates. This concept is particularly important in understanding the cost of carry, [market](../m/market.md) expectations, and the overall [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md). 

## Key Components

### Futures Contracts

A [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) is a standardized legal agreement to buy or sell a particular [commodity](../c/commodity.md) or [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future. [Futures](../f/futures.md) are traded on exchanges and are used for both hedging and speculative purposes.

### Contango and Backwardation

The term structure of [futures](../f/futures.md) can be in one of two main states: [contango](../c/contango.md) or [backwardation](../b/backwardation.md).

#### Contango

[Contango](../c/contango.md) is a situation where the [futures](../f/futures.md) prices are higher than the spot prices. In other words, [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) with later [maturity](../m/maturity.md) dates are priced higher than those with earlier [maturity](../m/maturity.md) dates. This condition occurs due to the cost of carry, which includes storage costs, [insurance](../i/insurance.md), and the [interest](../i/interest.md) foregone on invested funds.

#### Backwardation

[Backwardation](../b/backwardation.md) is the opposite of [contango](../c/contango.md), where [futures](../f/futures.md) prices are lower than the spot prices. It occurs when the benefit of holding the physical [asset](../a/asset.md) (such as dividends or convenience [yield](../y/yield.md)) outweighs the costs.

## Influencing Factors

Several factors influence the [futures](../f/futures.md) term structure, including:

### Spot Prices

The current price at which an [asset](../a/asset.md) is bought or sold is the [spot price](../s/spot_price.md), and this price is a primary input in determining the [futures](../f/futures.md) price.

### Interest Rates

[Interest](../i/interest.md) rates affect the cost of carry, as the cost of funding the purchase of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) is dependent on prevailing [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

### Storage Costs

For physical commodities, storage costs—including [warehousing](../w/warehousing.md), [insurance](../i/insurance.md), and deterioration—can influence the term structure.

### Dividends and Coupon Payments

For financial instruments like bonds and [stocks](../s/stock.md), the [income](../i/income.md) received from these investments (i.e., dividends or coupon payments) can impact the [futures](../f/futures.md) prices.

### Market Sentiment and Expectations

[Trader](../t/trader.md) sentiment and [market](../m/market.md) expectations about future price changes, [supply](../s/supply.md) and [demand](../d/demand.md), and macroeconomic factors also play a role.

## Theoretical Models

Several theoretical models help explain the term structure of [futures](../f/futures.md):

### Cost-of-Carry Model

The cost-of-carry model posits that the [futures](../f/futures.md) price equals the [spot price](../s/spot_price.md) plus the cost of carry. This model applies primarily to commodities and financial instruments with negligible [income](../i/income.md).

### Expectations Theory

The [expectations theory](../e/expectations_theory.md) suggests that the [futures](../f/futures.md) price is determined by the [market](../m/market.md)’s expectation of the future [spot price](../s/spot_price.md). According to this theory, the current [futures](../f/futures.md) price reflects the collective [market](../m/market.md) prediction of where the [spot price](../s/spot_price.md) [will](../w/will.md) be at contract [maturity](../m/maturity.md).

### Normal Backwardation and Contango Theory

Developed by Keynes, the theory proposes that [futures](../f/futures.md) prices are biased predictors of future spot prices because hedgers are willing to pay a [premium](../p/premium.md) to avoid [risk](../r/risk.md), leading to normal [backwardation](../b/backwardation.md). Conversely, if speculators dominate the [market](../m/market.md), prices may exhibit normal [contango](../c/contango.md).

## Practical Implications

### Arbitrage Opportunities

If the [futures](../f/futures.md) prices deviate significantly from what the theoretical pricing models suggest, arbitragers [will](../w/will.md) step in to exploit these differences, thereby bringing prices back towards [equilibrium](../e/equilibrium.md).

### Hedging Strategies

Understanding the term structure is crucial for hedgers who use [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) to mitigate [risk](../r/risk.md). For example, oil producers may use a [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) in [contango](../c/contango.md) to lock in higher future prices, thereby stabilizing [revenue](../r/revenue.md).

### Investment Strategies

Investors may develop strategies based on the term structure. For instance, a [trader](../t/trader.md) might buy short-dated [futures](../f/futures.md) and sell long-dated [futures](../f/futures.md) when the [market](../m/market.md) is in [backwardation](../b/backwardation.md), expecting the prices to converge.

## Market Examples

### Commodity Markets

In [commodity](../c/commodity.md) markets, the term structure can often signal future [supply](../s/supply.md) and [demand](../d/demand.md) conditions. For example, an oil [futures market](../f/futures_market.md) in [contango](../c/contango.md) might imply an [oversupply](../o/oversupply.md) in the [market](../m/market.md), whereas [backwardation](../b/backwardation.md) may indicate a current [supply](../s/supply.md) shortage.

### Interest Rate Markets

In the context of [interest rate futures](../i/interest_rate_futures.md) (e.g., Treasury [futures](../f/futures.md)), the term structure can reflect [market](../m/market.md) expectations about future [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. A steepening [yield curve](../y/yield_curve.md) indicating [contango](../c/contango.md) might suggest expectations of higher future [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

### Equity Index Futures

[Equity](../e/equity.md) [index futures](../i/index_futures.md) illustrate the term structure in relation to expected [equity market](../e/equity_market.md) performance. Factors like [dividend](../d/dividend.md) expectations and anticipated [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) can influence the [futures](../f/futures.md) prices.

## Real-World Companies Involved

### CME Group

[CME Group](https://www.cmegroup.com/) is a global markets company that owns large [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), [options](../o/options.md), and [futures](../f/futures.md) exchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile [Exchange](../e/exchange.md). They [offer](../o/offer.md) a wide [range](../r/range.md) of [futures](../f/futures.md) products and are a key player in the analysis and application of [futures](../f/futures.md) term structures.

### ICE (Intercontinental Exchange)

[ICE](https://www.theice.com/) operates numerous global exchanges and clearinghouses, and it is another pivotal player in the [futures](../f/futures.md) markets. They provide [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) on a variety of assets, from commodities to financial instruments, allowing for comprehensive [term structure analysis](../t/term_structure_analysis.md).

## Conclusion

Understanding the [futures](../f/futures.md) term structure is fundamental for participants in the [futures](../f/futures.md) markets, from hedgers to speculators and arbitragers. It allows for informed decision-making, optimal hedging and investment strategies, and the identification of potential [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) opportunities. Both theoretical and practical knowledge of the term structure can significantly impact trading outcomes and [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md).

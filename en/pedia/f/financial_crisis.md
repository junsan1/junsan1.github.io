# Financial Crisis

A financial crisis is a situation where financial assets such as [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, or [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) suddenly lose a significant part of their [nominal value](../n/nominal_value.md). Nations around the world have historically experienced financial crises that have had severe economic impacts. The complexities of financial crises are often characterized by the [insolvency](../i/insolvency.md) of banks, massive [stock market](../s/stock_market.md) crashes, and disruptions in international financial systems.

## Types of Financial Crises

### Banking Crises
A banking crisis occurs when a significant number of banks in a country are insolvent. These crises often lead to runs on banks, where a large number of customers withdraw their deposits because they believe the [bank](../b/bank.md) may become insolvent. Examples of notable banking crises include the U.S. Savings and [Loan](../l/loan.md) Crisis of the 1980s and the 2007-2008 Financial Crisis.

### Currency Crises
[Currency](../c/currency.md) crises happen when a [currency](../c/currency.md) experiences a rapid [devaluation](../d/devaluation.md) or a speculative attack due to [foreign exchange](../f/foreign_exchange.md) [market](../m/market.md) instability. This can result in significant economic consequences, such as increased [inflation](../i/inflation.md) and [capital](../c/capital.md) flight. The [Asian Financial Crisis](../a/asian_financial_crisis.md) of 1997 is a prominent example of a [currency](../c/currency.md) crisis where countries like Thailand, Indonesia, and South Korea faced severe devaluations and economic disruptions.

### Sovereign Debt Crises
Sovereign [debt](../d/debt.md) crises occur when a country cannot meet its [debt](../d/debt.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md). This can lead to sovereign defaults, where a country does not fulfill its [debt](../d/debt.md) repayments, often resulting in severe economic instability and loss of [investor](../i/investor.md) confidence. The Greek [Debt](../d/debt.md) Crisis that began in 2009 is an example of a sovereign [debt](../d/debt.md) crisis.

## Causes of Financial Crises

### Excessive Leverage
Excessive leveraging implies borrowing large sums of [money](../m/money.md) relative to one's [equity](../e/equity.md) [capital](../c/capital.md). When assets are over-leveraged, small losses in [asset](../a/asset.md) [value](../v/value.md) can result in [insolvency](../i/insolvency.md) for financial institutions or investors, which can trigger a broader financial crisis.

### Financial Deregulation
Loosening regulations around [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and institutions can increase [risk](../r/risk.md)-taking behavior, leading to the creation of [asset](../a/asset.md) [bubbles](../b/bubble.md) and other economically damaging outcomes.

### Asset Bubbles
[Asset](../a/asset.md) [bubbles](../b/bubble.md) occur when the prices of assets rise rapidly to levels that are not supported by the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s fundamental [value](../v/value.md). These [bubbles](../b/bubble.md) eventually burst, causing a sharp decline in [asset](../a/asset.md) prices and financial turmoil. The U.S. [housing bubble](../h/housing_bubble.md) of the mid-2000s is a well-known example.

### Contagion
Contagion occurs when financial instability or crises in one country spread to others, primarily due to interconnected economies and global [capital markets](../c/capital_markets.md). This can amplify and spread the crisis across borders, deepening and prolonging its impacts.

## Key Examples of Financial Crises

### The Great Depression (1929)
The [Great Depression](../g/great_depression.md) began with the U.S. [stock market crash](../s/stock_market_crash.md) in October 1929 and was characterized by severe worldwide economic [depression](../d/depression.md) through the 1930s. It led to massive job losses, bankruptcies, and a significant contraction in economic activity globally.

### Asian Financial Crisis (1997)
The [Asian Financial Crisis](../a/asian_financial_crisis.md) started in Thailand with the collapse of the Thai baht following the government's decision to [float](../f/float.md) the [currency](../c/currency.md). It quickly spread to other Asian nations and led to severe economic downturns in Indonesia, South Korea, and Malaysia.

### Dot-com Bubble (2000)
The Dot-com Bubble was characterized by rapid [speculation](../s/speculation.md) and overvaluation in internet-based companies during the late 1990s. It burst in 2000, leading to a massive decline in the [stock market](../s/stock_market.md), particularly affecting technology [stocks](../s/stock.md).

### Global Financial Crisis (2007-2008)
The Global Financial Crisis was the most severe financial crisis since the [Great Depression](../g/great_depression.md), primarily triggered by the collapse of the [housing bubble](../h/housing_bubble.md) in the United States and the widespread use of complex financial instruments. [Lehman Brothers](../l/lehman_brothers.md)' [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) in September 2008 exemplified the crisis's severity, leading to a [global recession](../g/global_recession.md).

## Effects of Financial Crises

### Economic Recession
Financial crises often lead to economic recessions, characterized by significant declines in GDP, higher [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) rates, and reduced consumer and [business](../b/business.md) spending.

### Deflation
[Deflation](../d/deflation.md) can occur during a financial crisis as the [demand](../d/demand.md) for goods and services decreases, leading to falling prices. Persistent [deflation](../d/deflation.md) can further weaken economic activity.

### Bank Failures
The [insolvency](../i/insolvency.md) of banks is one of the most direct effects of financial crises. [Bank](../b/bank.md) failures disrupt the [credit](../c/credit.md) system, making it harder for businesses and consumers to obtain loans.

### Government Interventions
Governments often need to intervene during financial crises through [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) (reducing [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, [quantitative easing](../q/quantitative_easing.md)) and [fiscal policy](../f/fiscal_policy.md) (stimulus packages, bailouts) to stabilize the [economy](../e/economy.md) and restore confidence in the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md).

## Regulatory Responses to Financial Crises

### Dodd-Frank Act (2010)
The [Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act](../d/dodd-frank_wall_street_reform_and_consumer_protection_act.md) was enacted in response to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. It introduced significant regulatory changes to increase [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and accountability in the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md), including the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).

### Basel III Accords (2010)
The [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md) Accords were introduced by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to strengthen regulation, supervision, and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) within the banking sector. It introduced more stringent [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements and [stress testing](../s/stress_testing.md) measures.

### The European Stability Mechanism (ESM)
The ESM was established in 2012 to provide financial assistance to [Eurozone](../e/eurozone.md) countries experiencing severe [financing](../f/financing.md) difficulties. It was created as part of broader measures to strengthen the monetary union and prevent sovereign [debt](../d/debt.md) crises.

## Companies Impacted by Financial Crises

### Lehman Brothers
[Lehman Brothers](../l/lehman_brothers.md) was a global financial services [firm](../f/firm.md) that declared [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) in September 2008, marking one of the most notable failures during the global financial crisis. [Lehman Brothers](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Lehman-Brothers-Bank)

### Greece's Financial Institutions
Greece experienced severe economic distress and [multiple](../m/multiple.md) bailouts during its sovereign [debt](../d/debt.md) crisis. The crisis significantly impacted its major banks like [National Bank](../n/national_bank.md) of Greece, [Alpha](../a/alpha.md) [Bank](../b/bank.md), and Piraeus [Bank](../b/bank.md). [National Bank of Greece](https://www.nbg.gr/en)

### Enron
Enron [Corporation](../c/corporation.md), an American energy company, faced a major scandal and declared [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) in 2001, highlighting corporate [fraud](../f/fraud.md) and [accounting](../a/accounting.md) malpractices.

## Conclusion

Financial crises are complex phenomena with far-reaching impacts on the global [economy](../e/economy.md). Understanding the causes, types, examples, and regulatory responses to financial crises is crucial to mitigating their effects and preventing future occurrences. Effective policy measures, [robust](../r/robust.md) regulatory frameworks, and vigilant [market](../m/market.md) practices are essential to safeguard financial stability and economic prosperity.

# Foreign Currency Swap

A Foreign [Currency Swap](../c/currency_swap.md) (FCS) is a financial agreement between two parties to [exchange](../e/exchange.md) [principal](../p/principal.md) and [interest](../i/interest.md) payments in one [currency](../c/currency.md) for equivalent amounts in another [currency](../c/currency.md). It is an essential instrument in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), allowing companies and institutions to manage risks associated with [currency](../c/currency.md) fluctuations, reduce costs, and optimize their [capital](../c/capital.md) structures.

## Overview

Foreign [currency](../c/currency.md) swaps are a type of [derivative](../d/derivative.md) instrument where two parties agree to [exchange](../e/exchange.md) specific amounts of different currencies on a predetermined schedule. The [swap](../s/swap.md) usually involves the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) of [principal](../p/principal.md) amounts at the inception and [maturity](../m/maturity.md) of the contract and periodic [interest](../i/interest.md) payments during the life of the [swap](../s/swap.md). These swaps can be tailored to meet the needs of the parties involved and can vary in terms of [duration](../d/duration.md), [currency](../c/currency.md) pairs, and [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) structures.

## Structure of Currency Swaps

### Principal Exchange

The [swap](../s/swap.md) begins with an initial [exchange](../e/exchange.md) of [principal](../p/principal.md) amounts in different currencies. This can be understood as a [loan](../l/loan.md) being provided in one [currency](../c/currency.md) and simultaneously taken out in the other [currency](../c/currency.md) between the two parties.

### Interest Payments

Throughout the life of the [swap](../s/swap.md), periodic [interest](../i/interest.md) payments are made based on the initial [principal](../p/principal.md) amounts. These payments can be structured in [multiple](../m/multiple.md) ways:
- **Fixed-for-Fixed**: Both parties make fixed [interest](../i/interest.md) payments on the notional amounts.
- **Fixed-for-Floating**: One party makes fixed [interest](../i/interest.md) payments, while the other makes floating [interest](../i/interest.md) payments that can vary over time.
- **Floating-for-Floating**: Both parties make floating [interest](../i/interest.md) payments, which adjust based on [market](../m/market.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) rates (e.g., LIBOR, EURIBOR).

### Maturity

At the end of the [swap](../s/swap.md) agreement, the parties [exchange](../e/exchange.md) the [principal](../p/principal.md) amounts again, reversing the initial [exchange](../e/exchange.md). This closing [exchange](../e/exchange.md) of [principal](../p/principal.md) is designed to ensure that each party regains the [currency](../c/currency.md) they originally swapped out.

## Benefits and Uses

### Hedging Currency Risk

Corporations with exposure to foreign currencies due to international operations can use [currency](../c/currency.md) swaps to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against possible adverse movements in [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates. It ensures that they can lock in [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates for future transactions, providing stability and predictability for [business](../b/business.md) planning and budgeting.

### Cost Reduction

Swaps can be used to reduce the cost of borrowing. For example, a company with a [comparative advantage](../c/comparative_advantage_in_trading.md) in a specific [currency](../c/currency.md) [market](../m/market.md) (e.g., lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates) can [swap](../s/swap.md) its [debt](../d/debt.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md) to another [currency](../c/currency.md), effectively reducing its overall borrowing costs.

### Access to Foreign Markets

[Currency](../c/currency.md) swaps can facilitate access to foreign [capital markets](../c/capital_markets.md). Companies may find it advantageous to borrow in a foreign [currency](../c/currency.md) to enter new markets or to [fund](../f/fund.md) foreign subsidiaries, using swaps to mitigate the associated [currency](../c/currency.md) [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Speculation

Traders and financial institutions may use [currency](../c/currency.md) swaps to speculate on future movements in [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates. By entering into a [swap](../s/swap.md), they can [profit](../p/profit.md) from favorable changes in [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates and [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

## Example of a Currency Swap

Consider two companies: Company A is based in the United States and needs Euros, while Company B is based in Europe and needs US Dollars. Both companies decide to enter into a [currency swap](../c/currency_swap.md) agreement.

1. **Initial [Exchange](../e/exchange.md)**: Company A exchanges USD 10 million with Company B, which provides EUR 9 million, based on the prevailing [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) at the time.
2. **[Interest](../i/interest.md) Payments**:
   - Every six months, Company A pays [interest](../i/interest.md) on the EUR 9 million at a fixed rate.
   - Simultaneously, Company B pays [interest](../i/interest.md) on the USD 10 million at a floating rate linked to LIBOR.
3. **[Maturity](../m/maturity.md)**: At the end of the [swap](../s/swap.md) term (e.g., five years), the [principal](../p/principal.md) amounts are exchanged back at the original notional amounts: Company A returns EUR 9 million to Company B, and Company B returns USD 10 million to Company A.

## Market Participants

Several entities participate in the foreign [currency swap](../c/currency_swap.md) [market](../m/market.md), including:

### Corporations

Multinational corporations use [currency](../c/currency.md) swaps to manage the risks associated with foreign [currency](../c/currency.md) transactions, [fund](../f/fund.md) international operations, and optimize their [capital structure](../c/capital_structure.md).

### Financial Institutions

Banks and other financial institutions act as intermediaries, facilitating [currency](../c/currency.md) swaps for clients, hedging their own [currency](../c/currency.md) exposure, and engaging in [proprietary trading](../p/proprietary_trading.md) activities.

### Governments and Central Banks

Governments and central banks use [currency](../c/currency.md) swaps to manage reserves, stabilize [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates, and support [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) objectives.

## Regulatory Considerations

[Currency](../c/currency.md) swaps, like other [financial derivatives](../f/financial_derivatives.md), are subject to regulatory oversight to ensure [market](../m/market.md) stability, [transparency](../t/transparency.md), and to mitigate [systemic risk](../s/systemic_risk.md). Regulations vary by jurisdiction but generally cover aspects such as reporting requirements, [counterparty risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md) management, and limits on [leverage](../l/leverage.md).

### Dodd-Frank Act (USA)

In the United States, the [Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act](../d/dodd-frank_wall_street_reform_and_consumer_protection_act.md) mandates increased [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and oversight of [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) markets, including [currency](../c/currency.md) swaps. The Act requires reporting of [swap](../s/swap.md) transactions to [trade](../t/trade.md) repositories and mandates central [clearing](../c/clearing.md) of standardized [swap](../s/swap.md) contracts.

### European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)

In the [European Union](../e/european_union_(eu).md), the European [Market](../m/market.md) [Infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) Regulation (EMIR) introduces similar requirements for the reporting, central [clearing](../c/clearing.md), and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) of over-the-counter (OTC) [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), including [currency](../c/currency.md) swaps.

# Foreign Currency Swap

A Foreign Currency Swap (FCS) is a financial agreement between two parties to exchange principal and interest payments in one currency for equivalent amounts in another currency. It is an essential instrument in financial markets, allowing companies and institutions to manage risks associated with currency fluctuations, reduce costs, and optimize their capital structures.

## Overview

Foreign currency swaps are a type of derivative instrument where two parties agree to exchange specific amounts of different currencies on a predetermined schedule. The swap usually involves the exchange of principal amounts at the inception and maturity of the contract and periodic interest payments during the life of the swap. These swaps can be tailored to meet the needs of the parties involved and can vary in terms of duration, currency pairs, and interest rate structures.

## Structure of Currency Swaps

### Principal Exchange

The swap begins with an initial exchange of principal amounts in different currencies. This can be understood as a loan being provided in one currency and simultaneously taken out in the other currency between the two parties.

### Interest Payments

Throughout the life of the swap, periodic interest payments are made based on the initial principal amounts. These payments can be structured in multiple ways:
- **Fixed-for-Fixed**: Both parties make fixed interest payments on the notional amounts.
- **Fixed-for-Floating**: One party makes fixed interest payments, while the other makes floating interest payments that can vary over time.
- **Floating-for-Floating**: Both parties make floating interest payments, which adjust based on market interest rates (e.g., LIBOR, EURIBOR).

### Maturity

At the end of the swap agreement, the parties exchange the principal amounts again, reversing the initial exchange. This closing exchange of principal is designed to ensure that each party regains the currency they originally swapped out.

## Benefits and Uses

### Hedging Currency Risk

Corporations with exposure to foreign currencies due to international operations can use currency swaps to hedge against possible adverse movements in exchange rates. It ensures that they can lock in exchange rates for future transactions, providing stability and predictability for business planning and budgeting.

### Cost Reduction

Swaps can be used to reduce the cost of borrowing. For example, a company with a comparative advantage in a specific currency market (e.g., lower interest rates) can swap its debt obligations to another currency, effectively reducing its overall borrowing costs.

### Access to Foreign Markets

Currency swaps can facilitate access to foreign capital markets. Companies may find it advantageous to borrow in a foreign currency to enter new markets or to fund foreign subsidiaries, using swaps to mitigate the associated currency risk.

### Speculation

Traders and financial institutions may use currency swaps to speculate on future movements in exchange rates. By entering into a swap, they can profit from favorable changes in exchange rates and interest rates.

## Example of a Currency Swap

Consider two companies: Company A is based in the United States and needs Euros, while Company B is based in Europe and needs US Dollars. Both companies decide to enter into a currency swap agreement.

1. **Initial Exchange**: Company A exchanges USD 10 million with Company B, which provides EUR 9 million, based on the prevailing exchange rate at the time.
2. **Interest Payments**:
   - Every six months, Company A pays interest on the EUR 9 million at a fixed rate.
   - Simultaneously, Company B pays interest on the USD 10 million at a floating rate linked to LIBOR.
3. **Maturity**: At the end of the swap term (e.g., five years), the principal amounts are exchanged back at the original notional amounts: Company A returns EUR 9 million to Company B, and Company B returns USD 10 million to Company A.

## Market Participants

Several entities participate in the foreign currency swap market, including:

### Corporations

Multinational corporations use currency swaps to manage the risks associated with foreign currency transactions, fund international operations, and optimize their capital structure.

### Financial Institutions

Banks and other financial institutions act as intermediaries, facilitating currency swaps for clients, hedging their own currency exposure, and engaging in proprietary trading activities.

### Governments and Central Banks

Governments and central banks use currency swaps to manage reserves, stabilize exchange rates, and support monetary policy objectives.

## Regulatory Considerations

Currency swaps, like other financial derivatives, are subject to regulatory oversight to ensure market stability, transparency, and to mitigate systemic risk. Regulations vary by jurisdiction but generally cover aspects such as reporting requirements, counterparty risk management, and limits on leverage.

### Dodd-Frank Act (USA)

In the United States, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act mandates increased transparency and oversight of derivatives markets, including currency swaps. The Act requires reporting of swap transactions to trade repositories and mandates central clearing of standardized swap contracts.

### European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)

In the European Union, the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) introduces similar requirements for the reporting, central clearing, and risk management of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, including currency swaps.

# Freddie Mac

Freddie Mac, formally known as the Federal [Home](../h/home.md) [Loan](../l/loan.md) [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) (FHLMC), is a public [government-sponsored enterprise](../g/government-sponsored_enterprise.md) (GSE) that was created in 1970 to expand the [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md) for mortgages in the United States. The entity buys mortgages on the [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md), pools them, and sells them as [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-backed securities (MBS) to investors on the [open market](../o/open_market.md). By doing so, Freddie Mac aims to provide [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), stability, and affordability to the nation's housing [market](../m/market.md).

## Overview

### Creation and Purpose
Freddie Mac was established by Congress as part of the Emergency [Home](../h/home.md) [Finance](../f/finance.md) Act to serve as a competitor to the Federal National [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) Association, commonly known as Fannie Mae. This competition was meant to reduce [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) costs and improve the availability of funds for [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) lending.

### Structure and Function
Freddie Mac operates by purchasing residential mortgages from lenders and either holding these mortgages in its portfolio or packaging them into [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-backed securities. These securities are then sold to investors, which provides fresh [capital](../c/capital.md) that lenders can use to create more [home](../h/home.md) loans. As such, Freddie Mac plays a crucial role in stabilizing and expanding the U.S. housing [market](../m/market.md) by ensuring a steady flow of [capital](../c/capital.md).

## Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS)
One of Freddie Mac's most significant contributions to the housing [finance](../f/finance.md) system is the development and [sale](../s/sale.md) of MBS. These securities are created through a process of [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [securitization](../s/securitization.md), which involves pooling [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) loans into a single, tradable [security](../s/security.md) that investors can buy. This process allows Freddie Mac to efficiently distribute [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) and provide investors with a product that offers a [return](../r/return.md) based on [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) payments from borrowers.

## Financial Products and Services
Freddie Mac offers several financial products and services designed to promote [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) in the housing [market](../m/market.md). These include:
- **Single-Family Securities:** These involve securitizing single-family [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) loans, turning them into MBS.
- **Multifamily Securities:** Freddie Mac also deals with multifamily properties, [offering](../o/offering.md) securities backed by mortgages on apartment buildings and other multi-unit properties.
- **[Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [Loan](../l/loan.md) Purchases:** Freddie Mac buys conforming loans that meet specific [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) guidelines, thus maintaining the flow of [credit](../c/credit.md).
- **[Credit Risk](../c/credit_risk.md) Transfer (CRT):** An innovative program where Freddie Mac transfers a portion of the [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) associated with its [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) loans to private investors.

## Regulatory Environment
Freddie Mac is regulated by the Federal Housing [Finance](../f/finance.md) Agency (FHFA), which oversees its operations, [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices, and financial soundness. The company operates under a conservatorship established by the FHFA in 2008 during the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) to prevent [insolvency](../i/insolvency.md) and maintain its vital role in the housing [finance](../f/finance.md) [market](../m/market.md).

## Financial Performance and Challenges
Freddie Mac's [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) is closely linked to the broader housing [market](../m/market.md) and [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md). During times of economic downturn, the [demand](../d/demand.md) for housing and the performance of [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) loans can decline, affecting Freddie Mac's [income](../i/income.md) from [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) purchases and MBS sales.

### The 2008 Financial Crisis
During the 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md), Freddie Mac was severely impacted due to its exposure to subprime and other risky mortgages. To stabilize the company, the federal government placed Freddie Mac (along with Fannie Mae) into conservatorship, providing emergency financial support and overseeing its operations to ensure it could continue to fulfill its mission without further destabilizing the [economy](../e/economy.md).

### Post-Crisis Era
Following the crisis, Freddie Mac has adopted stricter [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) guidelines, more rigorous [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices, and innovations in financial products to better manage and distribute [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [risk](../r/risk.md). Their efforts contribute to a more resilient housing [finance](../f/finance.md) system while continuing to support affordable housing initiatives.

## Research and Innovation
Freddie Mac engages in extensive research and innovation in housing [finance](../f/finance.md). This includes developing new financial products, improving [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) qualification processes, and addressing challenges in the housing [market](../m/market.md) such as affordability and accessibility. Their research helps inform policy decisions and advancements in the housing [finance](../f/finance.md) ecosystem.

## Impact on Homebuyers and Investors
Freddie Mac's operations significantly impact various stakeholders, including homebuyers, lenders, and investors. By maintaining [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) in the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [market](../m/market.md), Freddie Mac helps ensure that homebuyers have access to affordable and varied [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [options](../o/options.md). For investors, Freddie Mac's MBS provide an attractive [investment vehicle](../i/investment_vehicle.md) with returns tied to residential [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) payments.

## Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
Freddie Mac is committed to corporate [social responsibility](../s/social_responsibility.md), emphasizing initiatives such as:
- **Affordable Housing:** Supporting programs that make homeownership and rental housing more affordable.
- **Community Development:** [Investing](../i/investing.md) in community development through grants and partnerships.
- **Sustainable Practices:** Implementing environmental sustainability initiatives in their operations and [financing](../f/financing.md).

Freddie Mac maintains [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and ethical practices in its dealings, ensuring that their mission aligns with broader societal goals.

## Conclusion
Freddie Mac plays a crucial role in the U.S. housing [finance](../f/finance.md) system by ensuring a steady flow of [capital](../c/capital.md) to [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) lenders, promoting stability in the housing [market](../m/market.md), and supporting affordable housing initiatives. Despite challenges such as the 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md), Freddie Mac has adapted and continues to innovate, ensuring it meets its mission to provide [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), stability, and affordability to the housing [market](../m/market.md).

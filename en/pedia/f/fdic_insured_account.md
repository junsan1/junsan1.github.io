# FDIC Insured Account

An FDIC insured account refers to a type of [deposit](../d/deposit.md) account at a [bank](../b/bank.md) or savings institution that is covered by [insurance](../i/insurance.md) provided by the Federal [Deposit](../d/deposit.md) [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) (FDIC). This [insurance](../i/insurance.md) protects depositors by covering their deposits, up to the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) limit, in the event that the institution fails. This is an essential aspect of financial [security](../s/security.md) for consumers, providing peace of mind that their [money](../m/money.md) is safe even if the [bank](../b/bank.md) goes out of [business](../b/business.md).

## Overview of FDIC Insurance

The FDIC is an independent agency created by the Congress of the United States to maintain stability and public confidence in the nation's [financial system](../f/financial_system.md). The FDIC achieves this by insuring deposits, examining and supervising financial institutions for safety, soundness, and consumer protection, and managing receiverships.

### Coverage Limits

As of 2023, the standard [insurance](../i/insurance.md) amount provided by the FDIC is $250,000 per depositor, per insured [bank](../b/bank.md), for each account ownership category. This means that if you have [multiple](../m/multiple.md) accounts at the same [bank](../b/bank.md), they are all considered together when determining the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) limit. However, different ownership categories (e.g., single accounts, [joint](../j/joint.md) accounts, retirement accounts) are insured separately.

### Types of FDIC Insured Accounts

FDIC [insurance](../i/insurance.md) covers all types of deposits received at an insured [bank](../b/bank.md), which includes:
* Savings accounts
* Checking accounts
* [Money market](../m/money_market.md) [deposit](../d/deposit.md) accounts (MMDAs)
* Certificates of [Deposit](../d/deposit.md) (CDs)

FDIC [insurance](../i/insurance.md) does not cover investments such as mutual funds, annuities, [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policies, [stocks](../s/stock.md), and bonds, even if they are purchased at an insured [bank](../b/bank.md).

## Historical Context

The FDIC was established in 1933 in response to the thousands of [bank](../b/bank.md) failures that occurred in the 1920s and early 1930s. The Banking Act of 1933 (also known as the [Glass-Steagall Act](../g/glass-steagall_act.md)) established the FDIC, and federal [deposit](../d/deposit.md) [insurance](../i/insurance.md) became effective on January 1, 1934. Initially, the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) cover limit was set at $2,500. Over the years, this limit has been increased to adapt to changing [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md) and to provide greater protection to depositors.

## How FDIC Insurance Works

When a [bank](../b/bank.md) becomes insolvent, the FDIC steps in to protect the customers. Here’s a step-by-step outline of how the FDIC [insurance](../i/insurance.md) process works:

1. **[Bank](../b/bank.md) Failure Declaration**: The state or federal authority that regulates the [bank](../b/bank.md) [will](../w/will.md) declare it insolvent.
2. **FDIC Becomes Receiver**: The FDIC is appointed as the receiver. This means the FDIC takes over the [bank](../b/bank.md)’s assets and liabilities.
3. **[Insurance](../i/insurance.md) [Payment](../p/payment.md)**: The FDIC uses the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) [fund](../f/fund.md) to pay depositors up to the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) limit.
4. **Resolution of the [Bank](../b/bank.md)**: The FDIC either sells the failed [bank](../b/bank.md) to a healthy [bank](../b/bank.md), thereby transferring the insured deposits to the new [bank](../b/bank.md), or it pays depositors directly for their insured amounts.

## Importance of FDIC Insurance

FDIC [insurance](../i/insurance.md) serves several important purposes in the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md):

### Financial Stability

FDIC [insurance](../i/insurance.md) helps maintain stability and public confidence in the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md) by assuring depositors that their funds are safe. This reduces the likelihood of [bank](../b/bank.md) runs, where depositors rush to withdraw their funds out of fear that the [bank](../b/bank.md) [will](../w/will.md) [fail](../f/fail.md).

### Consumer Protection

It provides crucial protection for consumers, ensuring that their savings are not entirely lost if their [bank](../b/bank.md) fails. This [insurance](../i/insurance.md) contributes to financial [security](../s/security.md) and planning by protecting personal and [business](../b/business.md) savings.

### Market Discipline

The existence of FDIC [insurance](../i/insurance.md) also imposes a degree of [market](../m/market.md) discipline on banks. Knowing that their depositors are protected, banks operate within regulatory guidelines that promote safe banking practices.

## How to Ensure Your Deposits Are Fully Insured

Depositors can take several steps to ensure that their funds are fully insured:

1. **Understand the Limits**: Be aware of the $250,000 limit per depositor, per insured [bank](../b/bank.md), for each ownership category.
2. **Distribute Funds**: Spread out funds across different banks if your deposits exceed $250,000.
3. **Utilize Different Ownership Categories**: Take advantage of different account ownership categories like single, [joint](../j/joint.md), and retirement accounts to increase your coverage.
4. **[Check](../c/check.md) [Bank](../b/bank.md)’s FDIC Status**: Confirm that your [bank](../b/bank.md) is insured by the FDIC by checking the FDIC's BankFind tool.

## FDIC and Financial Institutions

Banks and financial institutions that are insured by the FDIC are subject to the agency's regulations and guidelines. These regulations are designed to ensure that banks operate safely and soundly while protecting consumers' interests.

### Bank Examinations

The FDIC conducts regular examinations of insured banks to assess their [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and compliance with laws and regulations. These examinations help identify and mitigate risks before they result in [bank](../b/bank.md) failures.

### Regulatory Enforcement

The FDIC has the authority to take enforcement actions against banks that [fail](../f/fail.md) to comply with regulations. This may include fines, sanctions, or other corrective actions.

### Deposit Insurance Fund

The funds used to insure deposits come from premiums paid by banks into the [Deposit](../d/deposit.md) [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) [Fund](../f/fund.md) (DIF). The DIF is maintained by the FDIC and is used to cover the cost of [bank](../b/bank.md) failures.

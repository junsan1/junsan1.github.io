# Fibonacci Retracement

## Introduction to Fibonacci Retracement

Fibonacci [Retracement](../r/retracement.md) is a popular tool used in [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) that is based on the key numbers identified by the mathematician Leonardo Pisano, commonly known as Fibonacci. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The sequence appears frequently in nature and has been found to be applicable in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) as well.

## Key Fibonacci Retracement Levels

Technical analysts employ Fibonacci [retracement](../r/retracement.md) levels to identify potential areas of [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md). These levels are calculated by taking two extreme points on a chart and dividing the vertical distance by the key Fibonacci ratios of 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 100%. The resulting [retracement](../r/retracement.md) levels are then plotted to identify areas where the price might find support or resistance.

### Explanation of Key Levels

- **23.6% Level**: The price may have a minor [correction](../c/correction.md) and then continue its original [trend](../t/trend.md).
- **38.2% Level**: A moderate level of [correction](../c/correction.md), often considered a first line of defense for a [market](../m/market.md) [trend](../t/trend.md).
- **50% Level**: Though not a Fibonacci ratio, the 50% [retracement](../r/retracement.md) level is widely used and indicates a significant [retracement](../r/retracement.md) level.
- **61.8% Level**: Often referred to as the “golden ratio” in Fibonacci analysis, this level is considered a strong area of support or resistance.
- **100% Level**: Represents a full [retracement](../r/retracement.md) of the prior move, also acting as significant support or resistance at times.

## Applying Fibonacci Retracement

### Identifying Highs and Lows

To apply Fibonacci [retracement](../r/retracement.md), traders identify a major peak and [trough](../t/trough.md) on the chart. For an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md), the lowest swing low point is selected, and the [retracement](../r/retracement.md) tool is applied to the swing high. In a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md), the highest swing high point is chosen, and the tool is applied to the swing low.

### Drawing the Fibonacci Retracement

Using charting software or platforms like Thinkorswim (https://www.tdameritrade.com/tools-and-platforms/thinkorswim.page), traders can easily draw Fibonacci [retracement](../r/retracement.md) levels. The tool plots horizontal lines at each of the key Fibonacci levels between the high and low points. 

### Interpreting the Levels

These levels help traders predict where an [asset](../a/asset.md)’s price might revisit support or resistance zones before continuing its original [trend](../t/trend.md). It allows for better timing of entries and exits in trades, aiding in effective [risk management](../r/risk_management.md).

## Theoretical Basis

The rationale behind Fibonacci [retracement](../r/retracement.md) levels stems from the belief that markets [will](../w/will.md) often retrace a predictable portion of a move, after which they can face resistance or support, and then proceed in the original direction.

## Implementations in Trading Strategies

Fibonacci [retracement](../r/retracement.md) can be implemented in various [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), including but not limited to:

- **[Swing Trading](../s/swing_trading.md)**: Traders look for these [retracement](../r/retracement.md) levels to identify potential [reversal](../r/reversal.md) points in the short to medium term.
- **[Day Trading](../d/day_trading.md)**: Intraday traders may use Fibonacci levels to time entries and exits during the trading day.
- **[Trend Following](../t/trend_following.md)**: These levels can be used within a larger [trend](../t/trend.md)-following strategy to enter positions after a [retracement](../r/retracement.md) to a key Fibonacci level.
- **Combining with Other Indicators**: However, it is often recommended to use Fibonacci [retracement](../r/retracement.md) conjunction with other [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicator.md) like Moving Averages, MACD, RSI, etc., to confirm signals given by [retracement](../r/retracement.md) levels.

## Real-World Use Cases

### Example

Assume a stock is trending upwards and forms a high at $100 after previously bottoming out at $75. Using Fibonacci [retracement](../r/retracement.md), the key levels are calculated as follows:

- 23.6% level: $75 + (0.236 × ($100 - $75)) = $81.9
- 38.2% level: $75 + (0.382 × ($100 - $75)) = $84.55
- 50% level: $75 + (0.5 × ($100 - $75)) = $87.5
- 61.8% level: $75 + (0.618 × ($100 - $75)) = $90.45
- 76.4% level: $75 + (0.764 × ($100 - $75)) = $94.1

At each of these levels, the [trader](../t/trader.md) might look for signals that the price is finding support before it continues the [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md).

### Usage in Different Markets

Just as useful in [equity](../e/equity.md) markets, Fibonacci [retracement](../r/retracement.md) is also applied to commodities, forex, cryptocurrency, and more. For example, in the forex [market](../m/market.md), Fibonacci [retracement](../r/retracement.md) is widely used to determine potential [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels in [currency](../c/currency.md) pairs.

## Tools and Platforms

Several trading platforms incorporate Fibonacci [retracement](../r/retracement.md) tools. Some prominent platforms include:

- **MetaTrader 4 and 5**: [Offering](../o/offering.md) comprehensive tools for Fibonacci analysis.
- **[TradingView](../t/tradingview.md)**: Widely used for its user-friendly interface and extensive charting capabilities. (https://www.[tradingview](../t/tradingview.md).com/)
- **Thinkorswim**: Powered by TD [Ameritrade](../a/ameritrade.md), known for [robust](../r/robust.md) analytical tools. (https://www.tdameritrade.com/tools-and-platforms/thinkorswim.page)
- **Chandelier TPS**: A newer platform that also integrates Fibonacci tools along with proprietary indicators. 

## Limitations

Despite its popularity, Fibonacci [retracement](../r/retracement.md) is not infallible. Some limitations include:

- **Subjectivity**: The selection of high and low points can be subjective, leading to inconsistent results.
- **Not an Absolute**: They indicate potential levels but do not guarantee that the price [will](../w/will.md) actually reverse or find support/resistance at these points.
- **[Market](../m/market.md) Conditions**: In highly volatile or news-driven markets, Fibonacci levels can be bypassed.

## Conclusion

Fibonacci [retracement](../r/retracement.md) is a versatile and widely-used tool in [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) that helps traders identify potential levels of [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) based on the Fibonacci sequence. When combined with other [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicator.md) and solid [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices, Fibonacci [retracement](../r/retracement.md) can significantly enhance [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). However, traders should always be cautious and consider the broader [market](../m/market.md) context when relying on these levels for making trading decisions.

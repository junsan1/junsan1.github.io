# Float-Adjusted Market Capitalization

Float-Adjusted Market Capitalization is a refined method of calculating market capitalization that reflects only the shares available to the public and excludes shares held by insiders, governments, or other strategic entities. This parameter provides a more accurate representation of a company's value from the perspective of everyday investors since it focuses on the shares that can be actively traded.

## Traditional Market Capitalization
To fully understand float-adjusted market capitalization, it's important to first grasp the concept of traditional market capitalization. Traditional market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the total number of a company's shares outstanding by the current price per share. For example, if a company has 1 million shares outstanding, and its current price per share is $50, the market capitalization would be $50 million.

**Formula:**
\[ \text{Market Capitalization} = \text{Shares Outstanding} \times \text{Share Price} \]

## Limitations of Traditional Market Capitalization
Traditional market capitalization has its drawbacks because it includes all shares, many of which may not be available for trading. These non-tradable shares often belong to:

1. **Insiders:** These can include company executives, directors, or employees who hold shares as part of their compensation packages.
2. **Governments:** In some cases, governments may hold substantial amounts of shares, often as part of privatization or as a strategic investment.
3. **Founders and Strategic Entities:** Founders, venture capitalists, and other pre-IPO investors may hold significant shares that are often subject to lock-in periods.
   
This inclusion of non-tradable shares can distort the perceived value and [liquidity risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md) of a company’s stock, making it seem more liquid than it actually is.

## Calculating Float-Adjusted Market Capitalization
Float-adjusted market capitalization refines this calculation by excluding shares that are not available for public trading. This offers a more realistic view of a company's market value from an investment perspective.

**Formula:**
\[ \text{Float-Adjusted Market Capitalization} = \text{Float Shares} \times \text{Share Price} \]

Where "Float Shares" are the total outstanding shares minus restricted shares (shares held by insiders, governments, etc.).

For example, if the same company mentioned above has 1 million shares outstanding but 300,000 of these shares are held by insiders, the float would be 700,000 shares. If the current share price is $50, the float-adjusted market capitalization would be $35 million.

\[ \text{Float-Adjusted Market Capitalization} = 700,000 \times 50 = 35,000,000 \]

## Importance in Index Construction
Float-adjusted market capitalization is particularly crucial in the construction and maintenance of stock market indices. Major indices like the S&P 500, FTSE 100, and others use float-adjusted market capitalization to ensure that the index more accurately reflects the performance and liquidity of the included companies. 

For example, the S&P 500 introduced float-adjusted market capitalization methodology in 2005. This change aimed to provide a more realistic and investable benchmark for index funds and institutional investors.

## Impact on Investments
Float-adjusted market capitalization has several implications for both passive and active investment strategies:

1. **Index Funds:** Many index funds use float-adjusted weights to allocate investments. This makes the index less susceptible to price manipulation since non-tradable shares are excluded.
2. **Liquidity Assessment:** Investors can get a clearer picture of a stock's [liquidity risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md), as the calculation does not include shares that are unlikely to be traded.
3. **Valuation Accuracy:** A more accurate valuation metric allows for better comparison between companies, especially in sectors where insider ownership can be substantial, like technology or pharmaceuticals.

## Case Studies
### Apple Inc. (AAPL)
As of 2023, Apple Inc. is one of the largest companies by market capitalization globally. Understanding its float-adjusted market capitalization can provide insights into its investment dynamics. 

On Apple's [Investor Relations page](https://investor.apple.com/), you can find detailed information about the number of shares outstanding, insider holdings, and more, which can help in calculating the float-adjusted market capitalization.

### Tesla Inc. (TSLA)
Tesla is another interesting example, given the significant amount of shares held by its founder, Elon Musk. The float-adjusted market capitalization of Tesla gives a better understanding of the company’s liquidity and market risk compared to its traditional market capitalization.

Details about Tesla's shareholding structure can be accessed on [Tesla’s Investor Relations site](https://ir.tesla.com/).

## Conclusion
Float-adjusted market capitalization is an essential metric for providing a more realistic view of a company's market value and [liquidity risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md). It is indispensable for [index construction](../i/index_construction.md) and is highly beneficial for various investment strategies. By excluding non-tradable shares, this metric ensures that investors and funds get an accurate picture of the stocks they are interested in, allowing for more informed decision-making.

# Float-Adjusted Market Capitalization

[Float](../f/float.md)-Adjusted [Market Capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) is a refined method of calculating [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) that reflects only the [shares](../s/shares.md) available to the public and excludes [shares](../s/shares.md) held by insiders, governments, or other strategic entities. This parameter provides a more accurate representation of a company's [value](../v/value.md) from the perspective of everyday investors since it focuses on the [shares](../s/shares.md) that can be actively traded.

## Traditional Market Capitalization
To fully understand [float](../f/float.md)-adjusted [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md), it's important to first grasp the concept of traditional [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md). Traditional [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) is calculated by multiplying the total number of a company's [shares](../s/shares.md) outstanding by the current price per share. For example, if a company has 1 million [shares](../s/shares.md) outstanding, and its current price per share is $50, the [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) would be $50 million.

**Formula:**
\[ \text{[Market Capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md)} = \text{[Shares](../s/shares.md) Outstanding} \times \text{Share Price} \]

## Limitations of Traditional Market Capitalization
Traditional [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) has its drawbacks because it includes all [shares](../s/shares.md), many of which may not be available for trading. These non-tradable [shares](../s/shares.md) often belong to:

1. **Insiders:** These can include company executives, directors, or employees who [hold](../h/hold.md) [shares](../s/shares.md) as part of their compensation packages.
2. **Governments:** In some cases, governments may [hold](../h/hold.md) substantial amounts of [shares](../s/shares.md), often as part of [privatization](../p/privatization.md) or as a strategic investment.
3. **Founders and Strategic Entities:** Founders, venture capitalists, and other [pre-IPO](../p/pre-ipo.md) investors may [hold](../h/hold.md) significant [shares](../s/shares.md) that are often subject to lock-in periods.
   
This inclusion of non-tradable [shares](../s/shares.md) can distort the [perceived value](../p/perceived_value.md) and [liquidity risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md) of a company’s stock, making it seem more [liquid](../l/liquid.md) than it actually is.

## Calculating Float-Adjusted Market Capitalization
[Float](../f/float.md)-adjusted [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) refines this calculation by excluding [shares](../s/shares.md) that are not available for public trading. This offers a more realistic view of a company's [market value](../m/market_value.md) from an investment perspective.

**Formula:**
\[ \text{Float-Adjusted [Market Capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md)} = \text{[Float](../f/float.md) [Shares](../s/shares.md)} \times \text{Share Price} \]

Where "[Float](../f/float.md) [Shares](../s/shares.md)" are the total outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md) minus restricted [shares](../s/shares.md) ([shares](../s/shares.md) held by insiders, governments, etc.).

For example, if the same company mentioned above has 1 million [shares](../s/shares.md) outstanding but 300,000 of these [shares](../s/shares.md) are held by insiders, the [float](../f/float.md) would be 700,000 [shares](../s/shares.md). If the current share price is $50, the [float](../f/float.md)-adjusted [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) would be $35 million.

\[ \text{Float-Adjusted [Market Capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md)} = 700,000 \times 50 = 35,000,000 \]

## Importance in Index Construction
[Float](../f/float.md)-adjusted [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) is particularly crucial in the construction and maintenance of [stock market](../s/stock_market.md) indices. Major indices like the S&P 500, FTSE 100, and others use [float](../f/float.md)-adjusted [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) to ensure that the [index](../i/index.md) more accurately reflects the performance and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) of the included companies. 

For example, the S&P 500 introduced [float](../f/float.md)-adjusted [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) methodology in 2005. This change aimed to provide a more realistic and investable [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for [index](../i/index.md) funds and institutional investors.

## Impact on Investments
[Float](../f/float.md)-adjusted [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) has several implications for both passive and active investment strategies:

1. **[Index](../i/index.md) Funds:** Many [index](../i/index.md) funds use [float](../f/float.md)-adjusted weights to allocate investments. This makes the [index](../i/index.md) less susceptible to price manipulation since non-tradable [shares](../s/shares.md) are excluded.
2. **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) Assessment:** Investors can get a clearer picture of a stock's [liquidity risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md), as the calculation does not include [shares](../s/shares.md) that are unlikely to be traded.
3. **[Valuation](../v/valuation.md) Accuracy:** A more accurate [valuation](../v/valuation.md) metric allows for better comparison between companies, especially in sectors where insider ownership can be substantial, like technology or pharmaceuticals.

## Case Studies
### Apple Inc. (AAPL)
As of 2023, Apple Inc. is one of the largest companies by [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) globally. Understanding its [float](../f/float.md)-adjusted [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) can provide insights into its investment dynamics. 

On Apple's [Investor Relations page](https://investor.apple.com/), you can find detailed information about the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) outstanding, insider [holdings](../h/holdings.md), and more, which can help in calculating the [float](../f/float.md)-adjusted [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md).

### Tesla Inc. (TSLA)
Tesla is another interesting example, given the significant amount of [shares](../s/shares.md) held by its founder, Elon Musk. The [float](../f/float.md)-adjusted [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) of Tesla gives a better understanding of the company’s [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and [market risk](../m/market_risk.md) compared to its traditional [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md).

Details about Tesla's shareholding structure can be accessed on [Tesla’s Investor Relations site](https://ir.tesla.com/).

## Conclusion
[Float](../f/float.md)-adjusted [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) is an essential metric for providing a more realistic view of a company's [market value](../m/market_value.md) and [liquidity risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md). It is indispensable for [index construction](../i/index_construction.md) and is highly beneficial for various investment strategies. By excluding non-tradable [shares](../s/shares.md), this metric ensures that investors and funds get an accurate picture of the [stocks](../s/stock.md) they are interested in, allowing for more informed decision-making.

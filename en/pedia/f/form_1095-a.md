# Form 1095-A

Form 1095-A, also known as the [Health Insurance Marketplace](../h/health_insurance_marketplace.md) Statement, is a form provided by the [Health Insurance Marketplace](../h/health_insurance_marketplace.md). This form is used to file your federal [taxes](../t/taxes.md) if you have [health insurance](../h/health_insurance.md) coverage through the [Health Insurance Marketplace](../h/health_insurance_marketplace.md). This document reports [insurance](../i/insurance.md) coverage details, including the months you were covered and the amount of any Advance [Premium](../p/premium.md) [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md) (APTC) paid towards your coverage.

## Purpose and Importance of Form 1095-A

Form 1095-A is crucial for taxpayers who obtained their [health insurance](../h/health_insurance.md) through a [Health Insurance Marketplace](../h/health_insurance_marketplace.md) established under the [Affordable Care Act](../a/affordable_care_act.md) (ACA). This form demonstrates proof of [insurance](../i/insurance.md) coverage and helps individuals reconcile the advance payments of the [premium](../p/premium.md) [tax credit](../t/tax_credit.md) on their tax returns.

The information included in Form 1095-A is needed to fill out Form 8962, [Premium](../p/premium.md) [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md) (PTC), which determines the amount of [premium](../p/premium.md) [tax credit](../t/tax_credit.md) you can claim when filing your [tax return](../t/tax_return.md), or if you need to repay any excess advance payments of the [premium](../p/premium.md) [tax credit](../t/tax_credit.md).

## Structure of Form 1095-A

The Form 1095-A consists of three main parts:

1. **Part I: Covered Individuals** - Lists details about the primary policyholder, including name, [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) Number (SSN), and the number of months covered.

2. **Part II: Coverage Information** - Provides information about the [Health Insurance Marketplace](../h/health_insurance_marketplace.md) policy, including the premiums for the second lowest cost Silver plan ([benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) plan), which is significant for calculating the allowable [premium](../p/premium.md) [tax credit](../t/tax_credit.md).

3. **Part III: Monthly [Premium](../p/premium.md) Amounts** - Includes monthly [premium](../p/premium.md) amounts and any APTC received. It also includes the amount of the premiums for the plan in which you are enrolled and the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) plan.

## Key Elements of Form 1095-A

### 1. Marketplace Identifier
Each Marketplace has a unique identifier which is included on Form 1095-A. It ensures that the IRS can recognize the exact Marketplace that the health plan was purchased from.

### 2. Policy Number
This helps in identifying the specific [health insurance](../h/health_insurance.md) policy associated with the Marketplace, essential for confirming coverage details.

### 3. Coverage Dates
The coverage dates indicate the specific months during which the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) and their family members had [health insurance](../h/health_insurance.md) coverage through the Marketplace.

### 4. Premiums Paid
The payments made for the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) policy are provided with details for each month. It is crucial for determining the total [premium](../p/premium.md) amount and contrasting it with the APTC received.

### 5. Advance Premium Tax Credit
It shows the amounts of the [premium](../p/premium.md) tax credits paid to the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies on behalf of the taxpayers.

## How Form 1095-A is Used in Tax Filing

While filing [taxes](../t/taxes.md), the information from Form 1095-A needs to be entered into Form 8962. This helps taxpayers to:

1. **Claim the [Premium](../p/premium.md) [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md)**: The [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) can claim any additional [premium](../p/premium.md) [tax credit](../t/tax_credit.md) not already applied during the year.
2. **Repay Excess Advance Payments**: If excess APTC was received based on an overestimation of [income](../i/income.md) or underestimation of household size, Form 8962 [will](../w/will.md) help calculate the excess amount that needs to be repaid to the IRS.

### Steps to Use Form 1095-A

1. **Collect [Income](../i/income.md) Information**: Gather all necessary documentation reflecting your annual [income](../i/income.md).
2. **Review Form 1095-A**: Verify the information on Form 1095-A, ensuring its accuracy.
3. **Complete Form 8962**: Using information from Form 1095-A, complete Form 8962 to calculate the amount of [premium](../p/premium.md) [tax credit](../t/tax_credit.md).
4. **File [Tax Return](../t/tax_return.md)**: Attach the completed Form 8962 to your federal [tax return](../t/tax_return.md).

## Common Issues with Form 1095-A

### 1. Errors in Details
Incorrect information can lead to discrepancies when filing your [tax return](../t/tax_return.md). It is essential to review and confirm each detail on Form 1095-A thoroughly.

### 2. Missing Form
If you haven't received Form 1095-A but believe you should have, contact the [Health Insurance Marketplace](../h/health_insurance_marketplace.md) immediately to request a copy.

[Health Insurance](../h/health_insurance.md) Marketplaces are required to send Form 1095-A to individuals by January 31st of the year following the coverage year. The form can be obtained electronically or through mail depending on the individual's preference.

## Key Differences Between Form 1095-A, 1095-B, and 1095-C

# Front Month Contracts

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), also known as algo trading, uses computer programs and algorithms to execute trades based on predefined criteria. A vital element in this sphere is the understanding and application of forward and [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md), one of which is the front month contract. This document delves into the details of front month contracts and their significance in algo trading.

### Front Month Contracts Defined

A front month contract refers to the nearest expiration date futures contract in the financial market. It is the contract with the closest upcoming delivery or settlement date. For instance, if it is January and a futures contract is set to expire in February, that would be considered the front month contract. These contracts are crucial because they usually exhibit higher liquidity and more accurate tracking of the underlying asset’s spot price compared to longer-dated contracts.

### Importance in Algorithmic Trading

The importance of front month contracts in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) cannot be overstated. Here are several key reasons:

1. **Liquidity**: Front month contracts are usually the most liquid, making it easier and cheaper to enter and exit positions. This high liquidity reduces the impact of slippage, which occurs when the execution of an order causes the price to move.
   
2. **Accuracy**: Front month contracts have prices that tend to be closer to the actual underlying asset’s current price. This reduces the basis risk, which is the risk that the futures price might diverge from the spot price.
   
3. **Volatility**: These contracts often have higher volatility than longer-dated contracts, presenting more opportunities for [short-term trading](../s/short-term_trading.md) strategies.

### Trading Strategies

There are numerous [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) involving front month contracts that are widely utilized in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md):

1. **Calendar Spreads**: This strategy involves taking a position in both a front month contract and a longer-dated contract simultaneously. Traders profit from changes in the price difference between these contracts.

2. **[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**: When discrepancies arise between the price of an asset in the spot market and its price in the futures market, traders use front month contracts to capitalize on these differences.

3. **[Momentum Trading](../m/momentum_trading.md)**: Algorithms are set to detect momentum in the front month contract's price movements, allowing traders to take positions accordingly.

### Application and Utility

Front month contracts are widely used in a variety of markets, including:

- **Commodities**: Markets like crude oil, natural gas, gold, and silver depend heavily on front month contracts for hedging and speculative purposes.

Example: Crude oil front month contracts are crucial because the commodities market is heavily influenced by near-term supply and demand factors.

- **Equities**: Stock [index futures](../i/index_futures.md), such as the S&P 500 front month futures, help traders gain exposure to the overall stock market performance without having to trade individual stocks.
  
- **Interest Rates**: Treasury bonds and Eurodollar futures often focus on the front month to gauge short-term interest rate expectations.

### Example of Companies

Several companies and exchanges specialize in offering a range of [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md), including front month contracts. Some well-known firms include:

- **CME Group**: [CME Group](https://www.cmegroup.com) offers a wide variety of [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md), including front month contracts across multiple asset classes like equities, commodities, and fixed income.

- **Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)**: [ICE](https://www.theice.com) provides markets for trading futures across global commodities, currencies, and financial products.

- **Nasdaq**: [Nasdaq Futures](https://www.nasdaq.com) offers trading opportunities in equity [index futures](../i/index_futures.md) and options, often highlighting front month contracts.

### Risks and Management

While front month contracts offer many advantages, they also come with specific risks:

1. **High Volatility**: The same volatility that provides trading opportunities can also lead to significant losses if not managed correctly.

2. **Roll Risk**: Traders who wish to maintain their position in the market need to "roll" contracts (shift their position from an expiring front month contract to a new front month contract), which can incur additional costs and risks.

To manage these risks, traders often use advanced algorithms that dynamically adjust positions and implement [hedging strategies](../h/hedging_strategies.md) to mitigate potential losses.

### Conclusion

Understanding front month contracts is essential for anyone involved in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). These contracts provide liquidity, accuracy, and trading opportunities that are unparalleled compared to their longer-dated counterparts. However, traders must also be aware of the inherent risks and utilize advanced [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) techniques to capitalize on the benefits while minimizing potential downsides. By doing so, traders can enhance their performance and achieve better outcomes in the highly competitive world of algo trading.

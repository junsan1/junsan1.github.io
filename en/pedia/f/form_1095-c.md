# Form 1095-C

## Introduction to Form 1095-C

Form 1095-C is a tax form used in the United States, primarily for reporting health insurance coverage offered by employers to their employees under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). This form plays a significant role in ensuring that businesses comply with the ACA's Employer Shared Responsibility Provisions. While it may seem unrelated to algorithmic trading (or "algo trading"), understanding Form 1095-C is essential for employers in the financial sector to manage compliance and avoid potential penalties.

## Purpose of Form 1095-C

The primary purpose of Form 1095-C is to report whether an employer offered health insurance coverage to its full-time employees and their dependents, and if so, the level of coverage offered. This information helps the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) enforce the individual mandate that requires individuals to maintain minimum essential health coverage or face a penalty.

## Key Sections of Form 1095-C

Form 1095-C consists of several parts, each providing crucial information regarding employer-provided health coverage:

1. **Part I: Employee and Employer Information**
    - This section includes basic details about the employee and the employer, such as names, addresses, and Social Security Numbers (SSNs) or Employer Identification Numbers (EINs).

2. **Part II: Employee Offer and Coverage**
    - This part details the type of health coverage offered to the employee, the lowest-cost monthly premium for self-only coverage, and the applicable safe harbor codes, if any.

3. **Part III: Covered Individuals**
    - This section is filled out only if the employer provides self-insured coverage, listing all individuals covered under the employer’s health plan, including employees and their dependents.

## Reporting Requirements for Employers

Employers with 50 or more full-time employees, including full-time equivalent employees (Applicable Large Employers or ALEs), are required to file Form 1095-C for each full-time employee. These forms help the IRS determine whether the employer has complied with the ACA's Employer Mandate.

## Filing and Distribution

Employers must file Form 1095-C with the IRS and furnish a copy to each covered employee. The deadlines for these tasks are typically as follows:
- **Filing with the IRS**: Usually by March 31 if filing electronically, or by February 28 if filing by paper.
- **Furnishing to Employees**: By January 31.

If the deadlines fall on a weekend or holiday, they are extended to the next business day.

## Compliance and Penalties

Non-compliance with the reporting requirements of Form 1095-C can result in significant penalties. Employers must ensure accuracy and timeliness in filing and distributing these forms. Penalties may arise from:
- Failing to file the forms.
- Failing to furnish the forms to employees.
- Filing incorrect or incomplete forms.

## Form 1095-C in the Context of Algo Trading Companies

Algorithmic trading companies, like any other businesses, must comply with the ACA if they meet the criteria of ALEs. Given the often high turnover and the specific nature of employment in the financial sector, these companies need robust HR and compliance systems to manage their workforce's health coverage and ensure accurate reporting.

Some of the considerations for an algo trading firm regarding Form 1095-C include:
- **Accurate tracking of employee statuses**: Employees’ full-time or part-time status may change frequently, and accurate tracking is essential for proper reporting.
- **Integration with HR and payroll systems**: Automated systems can help ensure that data required for Form 1095-C is accurate and up-to-date.
- **Awareness of IRS updates**: Staying informed about changes in IRS regulations regarding Form 1095-C is crucial for continuous compliance.

# Futures

## Introduction to Futures

Futures are standardized financial contracts that obligate the buyer to purchase, and the seller to sell, an [asset](../a/asset.md) at a predetermined future date and price. These contracts are traded on futures exchanges and are used for a variety of purposes including hedging, [speculation](../s/speculation.md), and [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md). [Futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) can cover a wide [range](../r/range.md) of assets, including commodities, [stocks](../s/stock.md), indices, and [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

## Components of a Futures Contract

The key components of a [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) include:

1. **[Underlying Asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)**: The specific [commodity](../c/commodity.md), [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md), or [index](../i/index.md) that the [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) represents.
2. **Contract Size**: The quantity of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) that the contract represents.
3. **[Expiration Date](../e/expiration_date.md)**: The date on which the contract is settled.
4. **Settlement**: The process of fulfilling the terms of the contract, either through [physical delivery](../p/physical_delivery_in_trading.md) of the [asset](../a/asset.md) or through cash settlement.
5. **Price**: The agreed-upon price at which the [asset](../a/asset.md) [will](../w/will.md) be bought or sold.

## Types of Futures Contracts

### Commodity Futures

These contracts cover physical goods like [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md), natural gas, gold, silver, corn, soybeans, and wheat. [Commodity futures](../c/commodity_futures.md) are primarily traded on [commodity](../c/commodity.md) exchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (CME) and the Intercontinental [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (ICE).

### Financial Futures

These contracts cover financial instruments or indices rather than physical commodities. Examples include stock [index futures](../i/index_futures.md), [currency](../c/currency.md) futures, and [interest rate futures](../i/interest_rate_futures.md). These are traded on exchanges such as the CME and the New York Mercantile [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (NYMEX).

### Stock Index Futures

These are [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) based on a stock [index](../i/index.md), such as the S&P 500 or the [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md)-100. Rather than delivering [stocks](../s/stock.md), these contracts are usually settled in cash.

### Currency Futures

These contracts are used to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) or speculate on the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates between different currencies. Examples include contracts on the [Euro](../e/euro.md), British Pound, and Japanese Yen.

### Interest Rate Futures

These [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) are based on [interest](../i/interest.md)-bearing instruments such as government bonds and Treasury bills. They are often used to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md).

## Market Participants

### Hedgers

Hedgers use [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) to protect against price movements in an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). For example, a farmer might use [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) to lock in a price for their crop, while a company that needs oil might use futures to manage the [risk](../r/risk.md) of rising oil prices.

### Speculators

Speculators aim to [profit](../p/profit.md) from price movements in the futures markets. They buy or sell [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) based on their predictions of future price movements. Unlike hedgers, speculators do not intend to take [physical delivery](../p/physical_delivery_in_trading.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

### Arbitrageurs

Arbitrageurs take advantage of price discrepancies between different markets or related instruments. They buy and sell [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) simultaneously to lock in [risk](../r/risk.md)-free profits.

## Futures Exchanges

### Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)

The CME is one of the world's largest futures exchanges, [offering](../o/offering.md) a wide [range](../r/range.md) of [commodity](../c/commodity.md) and financial futures. More information can be found on their [official website](https://www.cmegroup.com/).

### Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)

The ICE operates global futures, [equity](../e/equity.md), and [commodity](../c/commodity.md) markets, and provides clearinghouse solutions. For more details, visit [their website](https://www.theice.com/index).

### New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX)

NYMEX is another major [exchange](../e/exchange.md), particularly for energy and metal futures. For more details, see their [website](https://www.cmegroup.com/).

## Margin Requirements and Leverage

One of the defining features of futures trading is the use of [margin](../m/margin.md). [Margin](../m/margin.md) is a [security](../s/security.md) [deposit](../d/deposit.md) that traders must put up to [open](../o/open.md) a futures position. It represents a fraction of the total contract [value](../v/value.md). [Leverage](../l/leverage.md) allows traders to control large positions with relatively small amounts of [capital](../c/capital.md), magnifying both potential gains and losses.

## Settlement and Expiration

At expiration, [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) must be settled. This can occur in one of two ways:

1. **[Physical Delivery](../p/physical_delivery_in_trading.md)**: The actual [commodity](../c/commodity.md) is delivered to the buyer.
2. **Cash Settlement**: The difference between the contract price and the [market price](../m/market_price.md) at expiration is paid in cash. This is common in financial [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md).

## Risks in Futures Trading

### Market Risk

[Market risk](../m/market_risk.md) refers to the [risk](../r/risk.md) of losses due to adverse price movements in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

### Liquidity Risk

[Liquidity risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md) arises when a [trader](../t/trader.md) cannot buy or sell a contract easily without affecting its price.

### Margin Risk

[Margin](../m/margin.md) [risk](../r/risk.md) involves the potential for [margin](../m/margin.md) calls, where the [trader](../t/trader.md) must [deposit](../d/deposit.md) additional funds to maintain their position.

### Counterparty Risk

[Counterparty risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md) is the [risk](../r/risk.md) that the other party in the contract [will](../w/will.md) [default](../d/default.md). Futures exchanges mitigate this [risk](../r/risk.md) through clearinghouses that guarantee the transactions.

## Algorithmic Trading in Futures

[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), or algotrading, involves the use of computer algorithms to [trade](../t/trade.md) [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) based on predefined criteria. This type of trading can be highly effective for capturing short-term [market](../m/market.md) movements and managing complex [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

### Types of Algotrading in Futures

#### High-Frequency Trading (HFT)

HFT involves executing a large number of orders at extremely high speeds. This type of algotrading looks to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on small price discrepancies that exist for short periods.

#### Statistical Arbitrage

Statistical [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) uses mathematical and statistical models to identify trading opportunities. In futures, this often involves exploring the relationships between different contracts and executing trades to [profit](../p/profit.md) from the identified inefficiencies.

#### Market Making

[Market](../m/market.md) making algos provide [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) to the [market](../m/market.md) by continuously quoting both buy and sell prices. These algorithms [profit](../p/profit.md) from the [bid-ask spread](../b/bid-ask_spread.md) and the [volume](../v/volume.md) of trades they facilitate.

#### Trend Following

[Trend following](../t/trend_following.md) algorithms identify the direction of the [market](../m/market.md) [trend](../t/trend.md) and execute trades in the same direction. This strategy is based on the idea that markets move in trends and that it is more profitable to follow the [trend](../t/trend.md) than to [trade](../t/trade.md) against it.

### Advantages of Algotrading in Futures

1. **Speed**: Algorithms can execute trades much faster than human traders.
2. **[Efficiency](../e/efficiency.md)**: Algorithms can process large datasets and identify trading opportunities that might be missed by humans.
3. **Consistency**: Algorithms can execute a [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) consistently, without the influence of emotions or [psychological biases](../p/psychological_biases_in_trading.md).
4. **[Scalability](../s/scalability.md)**: Once a trading algorithm has been developed, it can be easily scaled to [trade](../t/trade.md) [multiple](../m/multiple.md) markets and instruments.

### Disadvantages of Algotrading in Futures

1. **Complexity**: Developing and maintaining [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) requires a high level of expertise.
2. **Cost**: The research, development, and implementation of [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) can be expensive.
3. **Technology [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: Algotrading systems can be vulnerable to technical failures and cyberattacks.
4. **Regulation**: Algotrading in futures markets is subject to various regulatory requirements, which can add to the complexity and cost of implementation.

## Regulatory Environment

### Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)

The CFTC is the primary regulatory body for futures trading in the United States. It oversees the futures markets to ensure they operate in a fair and transparent manner.

### National Futures Association (NFA)

The NFA is a self-regulatory organization for the U.S. futures [industry](../i/industry.md). It establishes and enforces standards for the conduct of its members in futures markets.

### European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA)

ESMA is responsible for regulating futures trading in the [European Union](../e/european_union_(eu).md). It aims to enhance the protection of investors and ensure the stability of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

## Conclusion

[Futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) are powerful financial instruments used by a wide [range](../r/range.md) of [market](../m/market.md) participants for hedging, [speculation](../s/speculation.md), and [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md). The use of futures spans across various [asset](../a/asset.md) classes, including commodities, financial instruments, and indices. With the advent of [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), the landscape of futures trading has evolved, [offering](../o/offering.md) new opportunities and challenges. While futures trading can be highly profitable, it also involves significant risks that must be carefully managed. Regulatory bodies like the CFTC, NFA, and ESMA play crucial roles in maintaining the integrity and stability of futures markets.

# Fundamental Analysis

Fundamental Analysis (FA) is a method of evaluating a security by attempting to measure its intrinsic value by examining related economic, financial, and other qualitative and quantitative factors. Fundamental analysts study everything from the overall economy and industry conditions to the financial condition and management of companies. The objective is to derive a value that an investor can compare with the security's current price in order to determine what sort of position to take with that security (underpriced, overpriced, or accurately priced).

## Key Components of Fundamental Analysis

### 1. Economic Analysis
Economic analysis involves studying the broader economic environment in which a company operates. This includes reviewing macroeconomic indicators such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), interest rates, inflation rates, unemployment rates, and fiscal policies.

### 2. Industry Analysis
[Industry analysis](../i/industry_analysis.md) focuses on understanding the dynamics and competitive structure of the industry in which the company operates. Porter’s Five Forces model is commonly used for this purpose, examining the following factors:
- Threat of new entrants
- Threat of substitutes
- Bargaining power of buyers
- Bargaining power of suppliers
- Competitive rivalry within the industry

### 3. Company Analysis
Company analysis dives into a firm’s financial statements and other pertinent information to determine its health and performance. This involves the following components:

#### Financial Statements:
- **Income Statement**: Reveals the company's revenue, expenses, and profits over a period.
- **Balance Sheet**: Provides a snapshot of the company’s assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity at a specific point in time.
- **Cash Flow Statement**: Shows the flows of cash into and out of the business over a period.

#### Ratios:
- **[Liquidity Ratios](../l/liquidity_ratios.md)**: Assess the company’s ability to meet its short-term obligations (e.g., Current Ratio, Quick Ratio).
- **Profitability Ratios**: Gauge how well the company uses its resources to generate profit (e.g., Return on Assets, Return on Equity).
- **Debt Ratios**: Examine the company’s leverage and its ability to meet long-term obligations (e.g., Debt to Equity Ratio, Interest Coverage Ratio).
- **Efficiency Ratios**: Indicate how well the company utilizes its resources (e.g., Inventory Turnover, Accounts Receivable Turnover).

#### Qualitative Factors:
- **Management Quality**: Evaluating the competency, experience, and ethos of the company’s management team.
- **Brand Value**: Understanding the strength and recognition of the company’s brand in the market.
- **Market Position**: Determining the company’s market share and competitive advantage.

### 4. Valuation Models
[Valuation models](../v/valuation_models.md) are used to estimate the intrinsic value of a company. Common models include:

#### Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis:
The DCF model estimates the value of an investment based on its expected future cash flows, which are discounted back to their present value.

#### Price to Earnings (P/E) Ratio:
The P/E ratio compares a company’s current share price to its earnings per share (EPS), reflecting what the market is willing to pay for each dollar of earnings.

#### Price to Book (P/B) Ratio:
The P/B ratio compares a company’s market value to its book value (net assets).

#### Dividend Discount Model (DDM):
The DDM values a company based on the theory that its worth is the present value of all its future dividends.

## Applications and Limitations of Fundamental Analysis
Fundamental analysis can be applied to various types of investments, including stocks, bonds, and other securities. However, it has its limitations. It often requires significant time and expertise to conduct a thorough analysis. For optimal results, it is typically used alongside other forms of analysis, such as [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md).

### Application in Stocks
Fundamental analysis is frequently used to determine if a stock is overvalued or undervalued by comparing its intrinsic value to its current market price. Investors might build a long position if the stock trades below its intrinsic value or a short position if it trades above its intrinsic value.

### Application in Bonds
In bond analysis, fundamental analysts assess the issuing entity’s ability to meet its debt obligations by examining its financial health, cash flow stability, and interest coverage ratios.

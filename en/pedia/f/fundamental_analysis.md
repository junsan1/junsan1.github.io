# Fundamental Analysis

Fundamental Analysis (FA) is a method of evaluating a [security](../s/security.md) by attempting to measure its [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) by examining related economic, financial, and other qualitative and quantitative factors. Fundamental analysts study everything from the overall [economy](../e/economy.md) and [industry](../i/industry.md) conditions to the financial condition and management of companies. The objective is to derive a [value](../v/value.md) that an [investor](../i/investor.md) can compare with the [security](../s/security.md)'s current price in [order](../o/order.md) to determine what sort of position to take with that [security](../s/security.md) (underpriced, overpriced, or accurately priced).

## Key Components of Fundamental Analysis

### 1. Economic Analysis
Economic analysis involves studying the broader economic environment in which a company operates. This includes reviewing macroeconomic indicators such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rates, [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) rates, and fiscal policies.

### 2. Industry Analysis
[Industry analysis](../i/industry_analysis.md) focuses on understanding the dynamics and competitive structure of the [industry](../i/industry.md) in which the company operates. Porter’s Five Forces model is commonly used for this purpose, examining the following factors:
- Threat of new entrants
- Threat of substitutes
- Bargaining power of buyers
- Bargaining power of suppliers
- Competitive rivalry within the [industry](../i/industry.md)

### 3. Company Analysis
Company analysis dives into a [firm](../f/firm.md)’s [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) and other pertinent information to determine its health and performance. This involves the following components:

#### Financial Statements:
- **[Income Statement](../i/income_statement.md)**: Reveals the company's [revenue](../r/revenue.md), expenses, and profits over a period.
- **[Balance Sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md)**: Provides a snapshot of the company’s assets, liabilities, and shareholders' [equity](../e/equity.md) at a specific point in time.
- **[Cash Flow Statement](../c/cash_flow_statement.md)**: Shows the flows of cash into and out of the [business](../b/business.md) over a period.

#### Ratios:
- **[Liquidity Ratios](../l/liquidity_ratios.md)**: Assess the company’s ability to meet its short-term [obligations](../o/obligation.md) (e.g., [Current Ratio](../c/current_ratio.md), [Quick Ratio](../q/quick_ratio.md)).
- **[Profitability Ratios](../p/profitability_ratios.md)**: Gauge how well the company uses its resources to generate [profit](../p/profit.md) (e.g., [Return on Assets](../r/return_on_assets_(roa).md), [Return](../r/return.md) on [Equity](../e/equity.md)).
- **[Debt](../d/debt.md) Ratios**: Examine the company’s [leverage](../l/leverage.md) and its ability to meet long-term [obligations](../o/obligation.md) (e.g., [Debt](../d/debt.md) to [Equity](../e/equity.md) Ratio, [Interest Coverage Ratio](../i/interest_coverage_ratio.md)).
- **[Efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) Ratios**: Indicate how well the company utilizes its resources (e.g., [Inventory Turnover](../i/inventory_turnover.md), Accounts [Receivable](../r/receivable.md) [Turnover](../t/turnover.md)).

#### Qualitative Factors:
- **Management Quality**: Evaluating the competency, experience, and ethos of the company’s management team.
- **Brand [Value](../v/value.md)**: Understanding the strength and recognition of the company’s brand in the [market](../m/market.md).
- **[Market](../m/market.md) Position**: Determining the company’s [market share](../m/market_share.md) and [competitive advantage](../c/competitive_advantage.md).

### 4. Valuation Models
[Valuation models](../v/valuation_models.md) are used to estimate the [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) of a company. Common models include:

#### Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis:
The DCF model estimates the [value](../v/value.md) of an investment based on its expected future cash flows, which are discounted back to their [present value](../p/present_value.md).

#### Price to Earnings (P/E) Ratio:
The P/E ratio compares a company’s current share price to its [earnings](../e/earnings.md) per share (EPS), reflecting what the [market](../m/market.md) is willing to pay for each dollar of [earnings](../e/earnings.md).

#### Price to Book (P/B) Ratio:
The P/B ratio compares a company’s [market value](../m/market_value.md) to its [book value](../b/book_value.md) (net assets).

#### Dividend Discount Model (DDM):
The DDM values a company based on the theory that its worth is the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of all its future dividends.

## Applications and Limitations of Fundamental Analysis
Fundamental analysis can be applied to various types of investments, including [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, and other securities. However, it has its limitations. It often requires significant time and expertise to conduct a thorough analysis. For optimal results, it is typically used alongside other forms of analysis, such as [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md).

### Application in Stocks
Fundamental analysis is frequently used to determine if a stock is [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md) or [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) by comparing its [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) to its current [market price](../m/market_price.md). Investors might build a long position if the stock trades below its [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) or a short position if it trades above its [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md).

### Application in Bonds
In [bond](../b/bond.md) analysis, fundamental analysts assess the issuing entity’s ability to meet its [debt](../d/debt.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md) by examining its [financial health](../f/financial_health.md), [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) stability, and [interest](../i/interest.md) coverage ratios.

By examining [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md), [industry](../i/industry.md) conditions, and company-specific financial data, investors can make informed decisions about their investments. Though it has its challenges and limitations, when combined with other methods, fundamental analysis can provide a [robust](../r/robust.md) framework for investment decision-making.

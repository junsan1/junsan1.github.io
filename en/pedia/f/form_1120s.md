# Form 1120S

Form 1120S, also known as the U.S. [Income Tax](../i/income_tax.md) [Return](../r/return.md) for an S [Corporation](../c/corporation.md), is the IRS (Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Service) tax form used by S corporations to report their corporate [income](../i/income.md), gains, losses, deductions, and credits. An S [corporation](../c/corporation.md), a type of [corporation](../c/corporation.md) that meets specific Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Code requirements, elects to pass corporate [income](../i/income.md), losses, deductions, and credits through to their shareholders for federal tax purposes. Here is an in-depth exploration of Form 1120S, covering its purpose, structure, filing requirements, and other key aspects.

## Purpose of Form 1120S

The main purpose of Form 1120S is to report all financial activities of an S [corporation](../c/corporation.md) to the IRS. Though the [corporation](../c/corporation.md) itself is not subject to [income tax](../i/income_tax.md), it must file the form to inform the IRS of its financial activities, which [will](../w/will.md) subsequently be passed onto the shareholders. This is in line with the "pass-through" [taxation](../t/taxation.md) system where the entity's [income](../i/income.md), losses, and other tax attributes pass through to the owners or shareholders who report them on their personal tax returns.

## Structure of Form 1120S

Form 1120S is divided into several parts, which collectively cover the entire financial landscape of the S [corporation](../c/corporation.md):

### Part I: Income

This section captures the [gross income](../g/gross_income.md) of the [corporation](../c/corporation.md). It includes:

- [Gross Receipts](../g/gross_receipts.md) or Sales
- Returns and Allowances
- Cost of Goods Sold
- [Gross Profit](../g/gross_profit.md)
- Other [Income](../i/income.md)

### Part II: Deductions

Here, the S [corporation](../c/corporation.md) reports deductions such as salaries and wages, repairs and maintenance, rents, [interest](../i/interest.md), [taxes](../t/taxes.md), and employee benefit programs. This section helps in reducing [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md).

### Schedule B: Other Information

This segment includes questions about the type of [business](../b/business.md), [accounting method](../a/accounting_method.md), and other operational aspects of the [corporation](../c/corporation.md).

### Schedule K: Shareholders' Pro Rata Share Items

In this schedule, the [corporation](../c/corporation.md) lists the shareholders’ proportionate share of [income](../i/income.md), deductions, credits, and other items.

### Schedule L: Balance Sheets per Books

This part requires reporting the beginning and end-of-year book balance sheets which provide vital financial metrics to the IRS.

### Schedule M-1: Reconciliation of Income (Loss) per Books With Income (Loss) per Return

This schedule bridges the gap between book [income](../i/income.md) and [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md), explaining any discrepancies.

### Schedule M-2: Analysis of Accumulated Adjustments Account, Other Adjustments Account, and Shareholders’ Undistributed Taxable Income Previously Taxed

This final schedule outlines the tracking of the balance in the accumulated adjustments account ([AAA](../a/aaa.md)) and other specific accounts.

## Filing Requirements

### Eligibility

Only eligible small [business](../b/business.md) corporations can elect to be treated as S corporations. They must adhere to the following conditions:

- Have no more than 100 shareholders.
- All shareholders must be U.S. residents.
- Only one class of stock is permitted.
- All shareholders must be individuals, estates, or certain types of trusts.

### Deadlines

S corporations are generally required to file Form 1120S by the 15th day of the third month after the end of their tax year, which is March 15 for calendar year filers.

### Attachments

The [return](../r/return.md) must include a Schedule K-1 for each [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md), which breaks down the [income](../i/income.md), deductions, and credits distributed among them.

## Important Schedules and Attachments

### Schedule K-1 (Form 1120S) - Shareholder’s Share of Income, Deductions, Credits, etc.

Each [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) receives a Schedule K-1 from the S [corporation](../c/corporation.md) which they use to complete their individual tax returns. The K-1 details the [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md)'s share of the [corporation](../c/corporation.md)'s [income](../i/income.md), deductions, and credits.

### Schedule B-1 (Form 1120S) - Information on Certain Shareholders of an S Corporation

This form is required if a [corporation](../c/corporation.md) has one or more shareholders who own, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the [corporation](../c/corporation.md)’s stock.

## Key Concepts and Definitions

### Pass-Through Taxation

S corporations themselves do not pay [income](../i/income.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md). Instead, [income](../i/income.md), losses, deductions, and credits pass through the [corporation](../c/corporation.md) directly to shareholders, who then report these on their individual tax returns.

### Reasonable Compensation

The IRS requires S corporations to pay "reasonable compensation" to shareholders who perform services for the [corporation](../c/corporation.md) before distributing dividends.

### Built-In Gains Tax

S corporations may be subject to built-in gains tax if they were previously a [C corporation](../c/c_corporation.md) or acquired assets from a [C corporation](../c/c_corporation.md). This tax is imposed on gains that were built-in (inherent) at the time the S election became effective.

## Benefits of Filing Form 1120S

### Avoidance of Double Taxation

By opting to be taxed as an S [corporation](../c/corporation.md) and filing Form 1120S, businesses can avoid [double taxation](../d/double_taxation.md)—a [corporation](../c/corporation.md) and its shareholders paying [taxes](../t/taxes.md) on the same [income](../i/income.md).

### Flow-Through of Losses

Losses incurred by an S [corporation](../c/corporation.md) can be used to [offset](../o/offset.md) the individual incomes of shareholders, providing financial relief during lean periods.

### Tax-Free Contributions

Contributions of property to an S [corporation](../c/corporation.md) are generally [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md), allowing for easier [capital](../c/capital.md) formation.

## Common Errors and Tips for Filing

### Common Errors

- Incorrect calculations of [income](../i/income.md) and deductions.
- Failure to attach necessary schedules and forms.
- Missing or incorrect [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) information.
- Errors in Schedule K-1 distributions.

### Tips for Accurate Filing

- Double-[check](../c/check.md) all calculations and figures.
- Ensure all schedules and forms are appropriately attached.
- Keep accurate and detailed records of [income](../i/income.md), expenses, and stockholder distributions.
- Seek professional assistance if the process becomes overwhelming.

## Key Takeaways

Form 1120S is integral for S corporations in the United States to report their financial status and ensure compliance with federal tax responsibilities. The form facilitates the pass-through of [income](../i/income.md) to shareholders, allowing for individual tax rates to apply and potentially saving on overall [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md). Understanding the form’s structure, filing requirements, and potential pitfalls is crucial for all S corporations to accurately and effectively fulfill their tax [obligations](../o/obligation.md).

# Financial Risk Management

Financial [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) is the practice of protecting economic value in a firm by using financial instruments to manage exposure to risk, particularly credit risk and market risk. It involves identifying, assessing, and prioritizing risks followed by coordinated and economical application of resources to minimize, monitor, and control the probability or impact of undesirable events. Financial [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) is a sub-discipline of [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) and is pivotal to a firm’s [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) framework.

## Key Components of Financial Risk Management

### 1. Risk Identification

Risk identification is the process of determining risks that could potentially prevent the program, enterprise, or investment from achieving its objectives. It includes documenting and communicating the concern.

#### Types of Risks

- **Market Risk:** This includes risk arising from fluctuating market conditions such as changes in stock prices, interest rates, currency exchange rates, and commodity prices.
- **Credit Risk:** The possibility that a borrower or counterparty might fail to meet their obligations in accordance with agreed terms.
- **[Liquidity Risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md):** The risk of not being able to meet short-term financial demands due to the inability to convert assets to cash without significant loss in value.

### 2. Risk Assessment

Risk assessment comprises the processes carried out to determine the extent and types of risk present. It is paramount to quantify risks to understand their likely impact on the firm's objectives.

#### Methods of Risk Assessment

- **[Quantitative Analysis](../q/quantitative_analysis.md):** Using statistical and mathematical models to predict potential losses and their probability (e.g., Value at Risk (VaR), stress testing).
- **Qualitative Analysis:** Using scenarios and expertise to evaluate the risk's nature and potential impact.

### 3. Risk Evaluation

Risk evaluation involves comparing the results of the [risk analysis](../r/risk_analysis.md) against risk criteria to determine whether a specified level of risk is acceptable or tolerable.

### 4. Risk Control

This is the stage where decisions are made about how to deal with the identified risks. Controls can be put in place to mitigate or transfer the risk.

#### Strategies for Risk Control

- **Avoidance:** Eliminating activities that give rise to risk.
- **Mitigation:** Reducing the likelihood or impact of risk.
- **Transfer:** Shifting risk to third parties through instruments such as insurance or hedging.
- **Acceptance:** Acknowledging the risk without any mitigation actions.

### 5. Risk Monitoring and Review

Risk monitoring and review is an integral part of the [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) process, ensuring that [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices are effective and that any changes in the risk profile are identified and addressed in a timely manner.

## Financial Risk Management Techniques

There are various techniques employed to manage financial risk:

### 1. Hedging

Hedging involves taking an offsetting position in a related security, such as a futures contract. A common purpose of hedging is to mitigate the risk of price movements in an asset.

#### Instruments for Hedging

- **Options:** Financial [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) allowing the holder to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price.
- **Futures & Forwards:** Agreements to buy or sell assets at a future date for a price agreed upon today.
- **Swaps:** Contracts to exchange cash flows or related financial instruments between parties.

### 2. Diversification

Diversification involves spreading investments across a variety of assets to reduce exposure to any single risk.

### 3. Insurance

Insurance is the transfer of risk to another party in exchange for payment. It is a well-established method of risk transfer and is often used to protect against specific losses, such as physical property damage or liability claims.

### 4. Limit Setting

Setting limits on exposures and ensuring adherence is a fundamental practice in financial [risk management](../r/risk_management.md). By managing limits, organizations can control the extent to which they are exposed to risks.

## Tools and Software for Financial Risk Management

Modern financial [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) heavily relies on advanced analytics and software tools for effective measurement and control.

### 1. Risk Management Information Systems (RMIS)

RMIS are integrated IT solutions used by firms to manage and aggregate data from various sources, enabling comprehensive [risk analysis](../r/risk_analysis.md).

### 2. Predictive Analytics Software

This software leverages statistical algorithms and machine learning techniques to predict future outcomes based on historical data.

### 3. SimCorp

## Regulatory Frameworks

Comprehensive understanding and compliance with relevant regulations are vital to financial [risk management](../r/risk_management.md).

### 1. Basel III

Basel III is a global regulatory framework established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. It focuses on strengthening regulation, supervision, and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) in the banking sector.

### 2. Dodd-Frank Act

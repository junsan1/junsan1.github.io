# Forex (FX)

Foreign Exchange, commonly known as Forex or FX, is the decentralized global market for the trading of currencies. Forex is the largest, most liquid market in the world, with an average trading volume that exceeds $6 trillion per day. Unlike other financial markets, Forex operates 24 hours a day, five days a week, making it highly flexible and appealing to both institutional and individual investors. The Forex market consists of a wide array of participants, including banks, financial institutions, corporations, governments, hedge funds, and individual traders.

## What is Forex Trading?

Forex trading involves the simultaneous buying of one currency and the selling of another. Currencies are traded in pairs, with the value of one currency being quoted against another. For example, the EUR/USD pair represents the Euro against the US Dollar. If a trader believes that the Euro will strengthen against the Dollar, they will buy EUR/USD. Conversely, if they believe the Euro will weaken, they will sell EUR/USD.

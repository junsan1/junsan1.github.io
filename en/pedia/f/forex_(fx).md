# Forex (FX)

[Foreign Exchange](../f/foreign_exchange.md), commonly known as Forex or FX, is the decentralized global [market](../m/market.md) for the trading of currencies. Forex is the largest, most [liquid market](../l/liquid_market.md) in the world, with an average trading [volume](../v/volume.md) that exceeds $6 trillion per day. Unlike other [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), Forex operates 24 hours a day, five days a week, making it highly flexible and appealing to both institutional and individual investors. The Forex [market](../m/market.md) consists of a wide array of participants, including banks, financial institutions, corporations, governments, [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds, and individual traders.

## What is Forex Trading?

Forex trading involves the simultaneous buying of one [currency](../c/currency.md) and the selling of another. Currencies are traded in pairs, with the [value](../v/value.md) of one [currency](../c/currency.md) being quoted against another. For example, the EUR/USD pair represents the [Euro](../e/euro.md) against the US Dollar. If a [trader](../t/trader.md) believes that the [Euro](../e/euro.md) [will](../w/will.md) strengthen against the Dollar, they [will](../w/will.md) buy EUR/USD. Conversely, if they believe the [Euro](../e/euro.md) [will](../w/will.md) weaken, they [will](../w/will.md) sell EUR/USD.

### Key Terminologies in Forex Trading

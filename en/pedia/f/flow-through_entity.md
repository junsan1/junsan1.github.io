# Flow-Through Entity

A Flow-Through Entity (FTE) is a legal [business](../b/business.md) structure where the [income](../i/income.md) of the company is passed directly to its owners or investors, thus avoiding the incidence of [double taxation](../d/double_taxation.md). This is because the [income](../i/income.md) is not subject to corporate [taxes](../t/taxes.md), but instead, owners or investors report the [income](../i/income.md) on their individual tax returns, where it is taxed at [personal income](../p/personal_income.md) tax rates. 

## Types of Flow-Through Entities

There are several types of flow-through entities, each with distinct characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages. The most notable are:

### Partnership

In a partnership, the entity's [income](../i/income.md) is divided among the partners according to a pre-agreed upon partnership agreement. This can include General Partnerships (GPs), Limited Partnerships (LPs), and [Limited Liability](../l/limited_liability.md) Partnerships (LLPs).

- **[General Partnership](../g/general_partnership.md) (GP):** In a GP, all partners participate in managing the [business](../b/business.md) and have [unlimited liability](../u/unlimited_liability.md) for the debts and [obligations](../o/obligation.md) of the partnership.
- **Limited Partnership (LP):** An LP includes both general and limited partners. General partners manage the [business](../b/business.md) and [hold](../h/hold.md) all the [liability](../l/liability.md), while limited partners contribute [capital](../c/capital.md) and share in the profits but have [limited liability](../l/limited_liability.md).
- **[Limited Liability](../l/limited_liability.md) Partnership (LLP):** LLPs [offer](../o/offer.md) a hybrid structure where all partners can manage the [business](../b/business.md) but with [limited liability](../l/limited_liability.md) protection.

### S Corporation

An S [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) is a special type of [corporation](../c/corporation.md) that elects to pass corporate [income](../i/income.md), losses, deductions, and credits through to shareholders for federal tax purposes. This status can be elected through the IRS.

### Limited Liability Company (LLC)

An LLC combines the [liability](../l/liability.md) protection of a [corporation](../c/corporation.md) with the tax treatment of a partnership. LLCs can choose to be taxed as a [sole proprietorship](../s/sole_proprietorship.md), partnership, or [corporation](../c/corporation.md), [offering](../o/offering.md) flexibility to owners.

### Trust

Certain types of trusts, such as [Grantor](../g/grantor.md) Trusts, are also considered flow-through entities. The [trust](../t/trust.md)'s [income](../i/income.md) is reported on the [grantor](../g/grantor.md)’s personal [tax return](../t/tax_return.md).

## Advantages of Flow-Through Entities

### Single Level of Taxation

The most significant advantage is the avoidance of [double taxation](../d/double_taxation.md). Corporate [earnings](../e/earnings.md) are not taxed at the corporate level; instead, they are taxed once on the owner’s [personal income](../p/personal_income.md) [tax return](../t/tax_return.md).

### Flexibility

Flow-Through Entities [offer](../o/offer.md) more flexibility in terms of [profit distribution](../p/profit_distribution.md) and the ability to deduct [business](../b/business.md) losses and other expenses on the owners' personal tax returns.

### Simplicity

In terms of tax filing, flow-through entities are simpler because there isn't a need for separate [corporate tax](../c/corporate_tax.md) returns apart from state-level requirements.

### Status as a Pass-Through Entity

In jurisdictions that recognize the status, achieving pass-through certification can make the [business](../b/business.md) more attractive to certain investors by reducing [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md) at the corporate level, thereby potentially improving returns on investment.

## Disadvantages of Flow-Through Entities

### Liability Exposure

In partnerships (especially GPs) and certain types of trusts, individual owners can be exposed to [liability](../l/liability.md) risks. Limited partners and LLPs [offer](../o/offer.md) more protection as do LLCs which limit [liability](../l/liability.md) to the [business](../b/business.md) assets.

### Self-Employment Taxes

Owners of certain flow-through entities are subject to [self-employment](../s/self-employment.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) on their [earnings](../e/earnings.md) which could be higher than traditional wage [income](../i/income.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md).

### Complexity of Distributions

While flow-through entities [offer](../o/offer.md) flexibility in distributions, they must also meticulously track profits, losses, and deductions to ensure accurate tax reporting for each owner or [investor](../i/investor.md).

### Eligibility Restrictions

Entities such as S Corporations have strict eligibility criteria, including limits on the number and types of permitted shareholders.

## Examples of Companies as Flow-Through Entities

Several companies adopt flow-through entity structures, particularly in [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) and professional services, to optimize their tax exposures.

### Blackstone Group (Partnership)

[Blackstone Group](https://www.blackstone.com) operates as a limited partnership. This structure enables it to pass through [income](../i/income.md) to its investors, avoiding [corporate tax](../c/corporate_tax.md) layers which is particularly beneficial for large [private equity](../p/private_equity.md) operations.

### Baker Tilly US, LLP (Limited Liability Partnership)

[Baker Tilly US, LLP](https://www.bakertilly.com) is a global [accounting](../a/accounting.md) and advisory [firm](../f/firm.md) structured as a [limited liability](../l/limited_liability.md) partnership. This structure allows partners to benefit from flow-through [taxation](../t/taxation.md) while limiting their legal liabilities.

### Venture Capital and Real Estate Investment Firms (Limited Partnerships)

Many [venture capital](../v/venture_capital.md) and [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) investment firms operate as limited partnerships. These include firms such as [Sequoia Capital](https://www.sequoiacap.com) and [Cushman & Wakefield](https://www.cushmanwakefield.com).

## Regulations and Compliance

While flow-through entities [offer](../o/offer.md) tax advantages, they are also subject to specific regulations and compliance requirements:

### IRS Rules and Guidance

The IRS provides detailed [guidance](../g/guidance.md) on how flow-through entities must report [income](../i/income.md), deductions, and credits. This includes specific forms such as Schedule K-1 for partnerships and S Corporations.

### State-Level Regulations

Many states have reciprocal or varying regulations for flow-through entities. Some states may require additional filings or impose separate [taxes](../t/taxes.md) on the entity's [earnings](../e/earnings.md).

### International Considerations

For businesses operating internationally, it is crucial to comply with both U.S. and foreign tax laws. Many countries do not recognize flow-through treatment, which can result in unexpected tax liabilities.

## Planning and Strategy

Effective [tax planning](../t/tax_planning.md) for flow-through entities requires comprehensive understanding of:

### Income Distribution and Allocation

Careful planning to allocate [income](../i/income.md), manage losses, and distribute profits in a tax-efficient manner.

### Estate Planning

For businesses structured as flow-through entities, it is crucial to have sound [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md) to manage transfer and succession issues.

### Entity Conversion

For certain businesses, converting from a traditional [corporation](../c/corporation.md) to a flow-through entity could [offer](../o/offer.md) tax advantages. However, such conversion must be approached cautiously to avoid potential pitfalls related to [capital](../c/capital.md) gains [taxes](../t/taxes.md) and other liabilities.

### Professional Advice

Seeking professional tax consultation is often beneficial to navigate the complexity of laws governing flow-through entities.

## Conclusion

Flow-Through Entities [offer](../o/offer.md) significant advantages in terms of tax [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md), flexibility, and simplicity for many types of businesses. However, deciding whether to establish a [business](../b/business.md) as a flow-through entity depends on various factors including [liability](../l/liability.md) considerations, eligibility requirements, and strategic [tax planning](../t/tax_planning.md) goals. Understanding the benefits and drawbacks, as well as consulting knowledgeable tax professionals, is essential for optimizing the financial outcomes and [operational efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md) of such [business](../b/business.md) structures.

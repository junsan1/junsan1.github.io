# First Mortgage

## Introduction to First Mortgage

A first [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) is the primary [loan](../l/loan.md) a borrower takes out to purchase a residential or commercial property. It is senior to all other liens or claims on the property in terms of [repayment](../r/repayment.md) priority if the borrower defaults. This means that in the event of [foreclosure](../f/foreclosure.md), the first [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) must be paid off before any subsequent loans or liens, such as second mortgages or [home equity](../h/home_equity.md) lines of [credit](../c/credit.md). This seniority makes the first [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) less risky for lenders, typically resulting in lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates compared to junior liens. 

## Key Components of a First Mortgage

### Principal

The [principal](../p/principal.md) is the original amount of [money](../m/money.md) borrowed from the [lender](../l/lender.md). This is the sum used to purchase the property and is subject to [repayment](../r/repayment.md) through monthly [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) payments over the [loan](../l/loan.md)'s term.

### Interest Rate

The [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) is the cost of borrowing the [principal](../p/principal.md), expressed as a percentage. There are two primary types of [interest](../i/interest.md) rates associated with first mortgages:

1. **[Fixed-Rate Mortgage](../f/fixed-rate_mortgage.md) (FRM)** - The [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) remains constant throughout the [loan](../l/loan.md) term, providing stability and predictable monthly payments.
2. **Adjustable-Rate [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) (ARM)** - The [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) can fluctuate at predetermined intervals based on [market](../m/market.md) conditions, which might lead to varying monthly payments over time.

### Amortization

Amortization refers to the process of gradually paying off the [loan](../l/loan.md) balance over the term of the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md). A typical [amortization schedule](../a/amortization.md) details each monthly [payment](../p/payment.md)'s allocation toward [interest](../i/interest.md) and [principal](../p/principal.md) reduction.

### Term

The term of a first [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) is the [duration](../d/duration.md) over which the borrower agrees to repay the [loan](../l/loan.md). Common terms include 15, 20, and 30 years. Longer terms typically have lower monthly payments but result in higher [interest](../i/interest.md) costs over the life of the [loan](../l/loan.md).

### Escrow

An [escrow](../e/escrow.md) account is often set up by the [lender](../l/lender.md) to collect and manage funds for property [taxes](../t/taxes.md) and homeowner's [insurance](../i/insurance.md). Part of the monthly [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [payment](../p/payment.md) goes into this account to ensure these expenses are paid on time.

## Types of First Mortgages

### Conventional Mortgages

Conventional mortgages are not insured or guaranteed by the federal government and can be conforming or non-conforming.

- **Conforming Loans** - These meet the guidelines set by government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) like Fannie Mae and [Freddie Mac](../f/freddie_mac.md). They have specific criteria regarding [credit score](../c/credit_score.md), [loan](../l/loan.md) limits, and [down payment](../d/down_payment.md) requirements.
- **Non-Conforming Loans** - These do not meet GSE criteria, such as jumbo loans that exceed the conforming [loan](../l/loan.md) limits.

### Government-Backed Mortgages

These loans are insured or guaranteed by [federal agencies](../f/federal_agencies.md), providing more flexibility for borrowers with lower [credit](../c/credit.md) scores or smaller down payments.

- **FHA Loans** - Insured by the Federal Housing Administration, allowing for lower down payments and more lenient [credit](../c/credit.md) requirements.
- **VA Loans** - Guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs for eligible veterans and active-duty service members, often requiring no [down payment](../d/down_payment.md) or private [mortgage insurance](../m/mortgage_insurance.md) (PMI).
- **USDA Loans** - Backed by the United States Department of Agriculture for rural property buyers, [offering](../o/offering.md) low-[interest](../i/interest.md) rates and no [down payment](../d/down_payment.md) [options](../o/options.md).

## Qualifying for a First Mortgage

### Credit Score

A higher [credit score](../c/credit_score.md) generally improves the likelihood of [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) approval and securing better [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. Lenders typically look for:

- **Excellent [Credit](../c/credit.md)**: 740 and above
- **[Good Credit](../g/good_credit.md)**: 700-739
- **Fair [Credit](../c/credit.md)**: 620-699
- **Poor [Credit](../c/credit.md)**: Below 620

### Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)

The DTI ratio is calculated by dividing the borrower's total monthly [debt](../d/debt.md) payments by their gross monthly [income](../i/income.md). Lenders prefer a lower DTI, typically:

- **Front-end Ratio**: Up to 28% of gross monthly [income](../i/income.md) allocated to housing costs.
- **[Back-end Ratio](../b/back-end_ratio.md)**: Up to 36%-43% of gross monthly [income](../i/income.md) allocated to total [debt](../d/debt.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md).

### Down Payment

The [down payment](../d/down_payment.md) is an upfront cash [payment](../p/payment.md) made by the borrower, reducing the [loan](../l/loan.md) amount and [lender](../l/lender.md) [risk](../r/risk.md). Common [down payment](../d/down_payment.md) requirements include:

- **Conventional Loans**: 5%-20%
- **FHA Loans**: As low as 3.5%
- **VA and USDA Loans**: Often 0%

### Documentation

Lenders require various documents to verify [income](../i/income.md), assets, and employment, including:

- Recent pay stubs and W-2 forms
- [Bank](../b/bank.md) statements
- Tax returns
- Employment verification

## Closing Process

### Loan Estimate

Within three [business](../b/business.md) days of receiving a [loan](../l/loan.md) application, lenders provide a [Loan](../l/loan.md) Estimate, detailing estimated [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, monthly payments, and total closing costs.

### Underwriting

The [lender](../l/lender.md)'s [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) team reviews the borrower's financial information to assess [risk](../r/risk.md) and ensure compliance with lending guidelines.

### Closing Disclosure

A Closing [Disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) is provided at least three [business](../b/business.md) days before closing, outlining the final [loan](../l/loan.md) terms and costs.

### The Closing

The final step involves signing the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) documents, paying closing costs, and transferring ownership of the property to the borrower.

## Advantages of a First Mortgage

### Lower Interest Rates

As a senior [lien](../l/lien.md), a first [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) typically offers lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates compared to junior liens, reducing the overall cost of borrowing.

### Tax Deductions

[Interest](../i/interest.md) paid on a first [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) may be tax-deductible, subject to IRS regulations, potentially reducing the borrower's [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md).

### Home Equity

A first [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) allows borrowers to build [equity](../e/equity.md) in their property over time, which can be leveraged for future financial needs or investment opportunities.

## Disadvantages of a First Mortgage

### Long-Term Commitment

Taking on a first [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) is a long-term financial commitment, often spanning 15-30 years, which may limit financial flexibility.

### Foreclosure Risk

Failure to meet [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md) can result in [foreclosure](../f/foreclosure.md), leading to the loss of the property and negative impacts on [credit](../c/credit.md) scores.

### Property Value Fluctuations

[Market](../m/market.md) conditions can affect property values; a decrease in [value](../v/value.md) could result in [negative equity](../n/negative_equity.md), where the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) balance exceeds the property's worth.

## Refinancing a First Mortgage

### Rate-and-Term Refinance

Borrowers may [refinance](../r/refinance.md) to secure a lower [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) or shorten the [loan](../l/loan.md) term, which can result in reduced monthly payments or a faster [loan](../l/loan.md) payoff.

### Cash-Out Refinance

A [cash-out refinance](../c/cash-out_refinance.md) allows homeowners to tap into their [home equity](../h/home_equity.md), receiving a lump sum of cash by refinancing the current [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) with a larger [loan](../l/loan.md).

## Conclusion

A first [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) is a fundamental component of homeownership, providing the necessary [financing](../f/financing.md) to purchase residential or commercial property. Understanding its key elements, types, qualifying criteria, and the overall process is crucial for making informed decisions and securing favorable [loan](../l/loan.md) terms. While first mortgages [offer](../o/offer.md) numerous benefits, including lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and potential tax deductions, borrowers must carefully consider the long-term commitment and risks involved to ensure financial stability and success.

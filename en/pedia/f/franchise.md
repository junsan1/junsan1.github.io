2. **Retail Franchise**: Sarah buys a 7-Eleven franchise. She operates her store using 7-Eleven’s branding and [business](../b/business.md) systems, paying [royalty](../r/royalty.md) fees based on her store’s [revenue](../r/revenue.md) while receiving support from 7-Eleven’s corporate team.
3. **Service Franchise**: Mike opens a Molly Maid cleaning service franchise. He uses the company’s established cleaning methods, [marketing](../m/marketing.md) strategies, and [business](../b/business.md) systems to attract and retain customers.

## Challenges

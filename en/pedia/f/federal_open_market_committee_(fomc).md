# Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)

The Federal [Open Market](../o/open_market.md) Committee (FOMC) is a component of the Federal Reserve System, which is the central [bank](../b/bank.md) of the United States. The FOMC is charged with overseeing the nation's [open market operations](../o/open_market_operations.md) (OMOs), which involve the buying and selling of government securities in the [open market](../o/open_market.md). This action is a key tool used by the Federal Reserve to regulate the [supply](../s/supply.md) of [money](../m/money.md) and [credit](../c/credit.md) in the United States [economy](../e/economy.md).

## Composition of the FOMC

The FOMC consists of twelve members:

1. The seven members of the [Board of Governors](../b/board_of_governors.md) of the Federal Reserve System.
2. The president of the [Federal Reserve Bank](../f/federal_reserve_bank.md) of New York.
3. Four of the remaining eleven Reserve [Bank](../b/bank.md) presidents, who serve one-year terms on a rotating [basis](../b/basis.md).

The [Board of Governors](../b/board_of_governors.md) is a federal agency that is appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the Senate. Each member serves a 14-year term, although the terms may be shorter if members resign or retire before their term ends.

## Structure and Meetings

The FOMC holds eight regularly scheduled meetings per year, and additional meetings as needed. These meetings are held to:

1. Review economic and financial conditions.
2. Determine the appropriate stance of [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md).
3. Assess the risks to its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md).

During these meetings, the FOMC reviews reports on economic and financial conditions, both domestically and internationally. The committee then decides whether to maintain or change the current policy of [open market operations](../o/open_market_operations.md).

The meetings culminate in a policy statement that typically includes:

- The level and outlook of [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md).
- Economic projections.
- The rationale behind the committee's decisions.

## The Role and Functions of the FOMC

### Open Market Operations (OMOs)

OMOs are a critical tool used by the Federal Reserve to control the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md). Through OMOs, the FOMC buys and sells government securities in the [open market](../o/open_market.md) to influence the amount of reserves in the banking system. 

When the FOMC buys securities, it increases the reserves of the banks, thus increasing the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) and typically lowering [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. Conversely, selling securities decreases [bank](../b/bank.md) reserves, reduces the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md), and usually raises [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

### Setting the Federal Funds Rate

The FOMC's primary tool for implementing [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) is the [federal funds rate](../f/federal_funds_rate.md), which is the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) at which [depository](../d/depository.md) institutions lend reserve balances to other [depository](../d/depository.md) institutions overnight on an uncollateralized [basis](../b/basis.md).

By setting a target for the [federal funds rate](../f/federal_funds_rate.md), the FOMC influences other [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, including the rates on loans and savings accounts, ultimately affecting economic activity such as spending, investment, and [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md).

### Forward Guidance

Forward [guidance](../g/guidance.md) is another policy tool used by the FOMC to communicate the anticipated path of [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) to the public and [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). By providing [guidance](../g/guidance.md) about likely future policy actions, the FOMC aims to influence financial conditions, economic behavior, and thereby help achieve its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability.

## Importance of the FOMC

The decisions made by the FOMC have far-reaching impacts on the [economy](../e/economy.md). These include influencing [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rates, employment rates, and overall [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md). The FOMC's actions can affect the following:

1. **[Interest](../i/interest.md) Rates**: By setting the [federal funds rate](../f/federal_funds_rate.md), the FOMC impacts the rates at which consumers and businesses borrow and save [money](../m/money.md).
2. **[Inflation](../i/inflation.md)**: Controlling the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) helps manage [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rates. High [inflation](../i/inflation.md) can erode [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md), while [deflation](../d/deflation.md) can lead to reduced spending and economic slowdowns.
3. **Employment**: By fostering conditions that lead to [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md), the FOMC indirectly affects employment levels. Lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates can stimulate borrowing and investment, leading to job creation.

## Historical Context

The FOMC's influence and tools have evolved since its inception in 1933, during the [Great Depression](../g/great_depression.md). Initially, OMOs were used to stabilize banks and control monetary conditions. Over time, the FOMC expanded its [scope](../s/scope.md) and techniques, adapting to changing economic landscapes.

**Key Historical Milestones:**

- **Post-World War II Era**: The FOMC focused on balancing growth with controlling [inflation](../i/inflation.md), adapting policies in response to post-war economic [expansion](../e/expansion.md).
- **1960s-1970s**: Periods of high [inflation](../i/inflation.md) led to new tools and strategies to combat economic instability.
- **1980s-present**: The FOMC adopted more sophisticated mechanisms, including nuanced [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) adjustments and comprehensive assessments of global [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md).

## Communication and Transparency

The FOMC emphasizes [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and clear communication to enhance the predictability and effectiveness of [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md). The committee releases detailed minutes of its meetings three weeks after each meeting, providing insights into the deliberations and views of its members. Additionally, the chair of the FOMC holds press conferences to discuss the committee's decisions and their rationale.

## Conclusion

The FOMC plays a crucial role in shaping U.S. economic policy and ensuring financial stability. Its decisions on [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, [money supply](../m/money_supply.md), and forward [guidance](../g/guidance.md) significantly impact the broader [economy](../e/economy.md), affecting everything from [inflation](../i/inflation.md) to employment. Through [open market operations](../o/open_market_operations.md), the setting of [federal funds](../f/federal_funds.md) rates, and forward [guidance](../g/guidance.md), the FOMC seeks to fulfill its dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and price stability.

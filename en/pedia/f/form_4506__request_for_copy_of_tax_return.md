# Form 4506: Request for Copy of Tax Return

Form 4506 is an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) document used by taxpayers to request a copy of a previously filed tax return. This form is particularly valuable for individuals requiring a complete duplicate of their tax records for legal purposes, such as divorce proceedings, loan applications, or other financial verifications. Understanding this form, its application, and how to properly complete and submit it is crucial for ensuring compliance with IRS regulations and for obtaining the necessary financial documentation.

## Purpose of Form 4506

The primary purpose of Form 4506 is to allow taxpayers to obtain a duplicate of a previously submitted tax return. The forms that can be requested include:

1. **Form 1040 series** (individual income tax returns)
2. **Form 1120 series** (corporate income tax returns)
3. **Form 1065** (partnership income tax returns)
4. Other forms filed with the IRS such as **Form 941** (employerâ€™s quarterly tax return)

A complete copy includes not only the return itself but also any attachments, such as W-2s, schedules, and forms that were originally submitted.

## Situations Warranting the Use of Form 4506

Form 4506 is often required in specific scenarios, including but not limited to:

- **Applying for a mortgage or loan**: Lenders often require a copy of tax returns to verify income and financial standing.
- **Tax preparation issues**: If a taxpayer or their preparer has lost the original return, a copy can be requested from the IRS.
- **Audits and legal proceedings**: Taxpayers undergoing audits, legal cases, or needing historical tax return information often need an official copy from the IRS.
- **Financial aid**: Some universities and financial institutions require a copy of tax returns for evaluating financial aid eligibility.

## Form 4506 vs. Transcript Requests

It's important to distinguish between Form 4506 and other types of tax document requests:

- **Form 4506-T**: This form is used to request a transcript of the tax return, which provides a summary instead of a full copy. Transcripts are often adequate for lenders and other entities requiring tax info.
- **Tax Return Transcript**: Summarizes most line items from the original tax return but does not include any attachments like W-2 forms.
- **Account Transcript**: Provides any changes made to the return after it was filed and any outstanding balances.
- **Record of Account Transcript**: Combines the tax return and account transcript information into one.

## Completing Form 4506

* Corporate requests must be signed by an officer with the legal authority.
* Partnerships require a partner's signature.

### Declaration of Representatives

If an attorney, CPA, or other representative is submitting the form, a signed power of attorney (Form 2848) must be included.

## Submission of Form 4506

Submit the completed form and payment to the applicable IRS address, which can vary based on the taxpayer's current residence and the type of return. Addresses are provided in the instructions for Form 4506.

Once submitted, the processing time can vary. On average, it takes about **75 calendar days** to process the request and issue the duplicate return. However, delays can occur during peak periods or if the records need to be retrieved from archives.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Rejected Requests

Common reasons for rejection include:

- Incorrect or incomplete information
- Non-payment of fees
- Unauthorized signature

To avoid these issues, double-check the form for accuracy and completeness and ensure the correct payment is included.

2. **Record-Keeping**: Maintain personal copies of tax returns and associated documents in secure storage spaces, either digitally or physically, to avoid future delays or the need for formal requests.

# Fiji Stock Exchange (SPSE)

The Fiji Stock Exchange (SPSE) is a central platform for the trading of securities in the Republic of Fiji. As a smaller and more niche market compared to major global stock exchanges, the SPSE plays a crucial role in the local economy by facilitating the raising of capital and providing investment opportunities.

## History and Development

The SPSE was originally established as the Suva Stock Exchange in 1979 before being renamed and restructured. Its development has been pivotal in fostering financial growth in Fiji, supporting not only domestic investors but also attracting foreign investments.

## Structure and Governance

The SPSE operates as a limited liability company and is governed by a board of directors. It is regulated under the Capital Markets Decree 2009, which provides a robust framework for ensuring market integrity, transparency, and investor protection. 

### Key Regulatory Bodies:
- **Reserve Bank of Fiji**: Acts as the regulator of the Fijian financial system, overseeing the operations of the SPSE.
- **Capital Markets Advisory and Development Taskforce**: Provides strategic guidance and advisories.

## Trading Mechanisms

The SPSE uses a call market system rather than continuous trading, meaning that trades are executed at specific times during the trading day. This system suits the relatively lower volume of trades common in smaller markets. Orders are matched once or twice daily, which can provide benefits such as reduced volatility and simplified trading processes.

## Listed Securities

The SPSE lists a range of securities including equities, bonds, and term deposits. While the number of listings is smaller compared to larger international exchanges, the SPSE features several prominent Fijian companies across diverse sectors such as banking, telecommunications, and manufacturing.
- **Examples of Listed Companies:**
  - **Amalgamated Telecom Holdings Limited (ATH)**: A major telecommunications provider.
  - **Fiji Television Limited**: A leading television broadcaster.
  - **RB Patel Group Limited**: A prominent retail company.

## Market Indices

The SPSE maintains specific market indices to track performance. The most notable among these is the SPSE Total Return Index (STRI), which measures the overall market performance, including capital gains and dividends.

### SPSE Total Return Index (STRI):
- Composition: Includes all listed securities on the SPSE.
- Utility: Provides a comprehensive indicator of market trends and overall performance.

## Investment Opportunities and Financial Products

Investors on the SPSE have access to various financial products tailored to meet diverse investment strategies:
- **Equities**: Common and preferred shares of listed companies.

- **Digital Integration**: Leveraging technology to offer increased access and convenience to investors, including online trading platforms.

## Economic Impact

The SPSE contributes significantly to the Fijian economy by enabling businesses to raise capital for expansion and development, thereby fostering economic growth and job creation. Additionally, the exchange plays a role in wealth creation for investors, expanding investment opportunities beyond traditional savings accounts and real estate.

## Challenges and Opportunities

### Challenges:
- **Market Size and Liquidity**: Being a smaller market, the SPSE faces challenges in terms of lower liquidity and fewer listed companies.

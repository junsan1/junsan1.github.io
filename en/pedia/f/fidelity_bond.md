# Fidelity Bond

A fidelity [bond](../b/bond.md), also known in some contexts as an honesty [bond](../b/bond.md) or employee dishonesty [insurance](../i/insurance.md), is a type of [insurance](../i/insurance.md) that protects businesses against fraudulent acts committed by their employees. Companies purchase fidelity bonds to safeguard against financial losses that occur due to dishonest actions such as theft, [embezzlement](../e/embezzlement.md), forgery, or other similar fraudulent activities. These bonds provide a financial safety net for businesses by transferring the [risk](../r/risk.md) of loss from the [business](../b/business.md) to the issuing [insurance](../i/insurance.md) company.

## Types of Fidelity Bonds

Fidelity bonds come in various forms, tailored to meet specific needs and risks faced by different types of businesses. The primary types of fidelity bonds include:

### 1. Business Service Bonds

These bonds are designed for companies providing services on clients' premises, such as janitorial, [security](../s/security.md), and [home](../h/home.md) healthcare services. A [business](../b/business.md) service [bond](../b/bond.md) protects the client if an employee steals [money](../m/money.md) or property from their premises.

### 2. Employee Dishonesty Bonds

Employee dishonesty bonds cover losses resulting from dishonest acts committed by employees, including theft, forgery, and [embezzlement](../e/embezzlement.md). These bonds can cover either individual employees or groups of employees. 

### 3. ERISA Bonds

ERISA bonds are mandated by the Employee Retirement [Income](../i/income.md) [Security](../s/security.md) Act (ERISA) for individuals who [handle](../h/handle.md) funds or property of employee benefit plans. These bonds protect against [fraud](../f/fraud.md) or dishonesty by the individuals responsible for managing the plan assets.

### 4. Financial Institution Bonds

These bonds are specifically designed for financial institutions such as banks, [credit](../c/credit.md) unions, and investment firms. Financial institution bonds cover losses due to employee dishonesty, as well as other risks like forgery, alteration, and robbery.

### 5. Fiduciary Bonds

Fiduciary bonds, also known as [probate](../p/probate.md) bonds or [executor](../e/executor.md) bonds, protect beneficiaries against fraudulent acts by individuals appointed to manage the [estate](../e/estate.md) of a deceased person, a [trust](../t/trust.md), or another fiduciary responsibility. 

## Benefits of Fidelity Bonds

### 1. Financial Protection

The primary benefit of fidelity bonds is the financial protection they provide to businesses. In the event an employee commits a dishonest act, the [business](../b/business.md) can file a claim on the [bond](../b/bond.md) to recover the lost funds, thus mitigating the financial damage.

### 2. Client Assurance

For businesses that work on clientsâ€™ premises, holding a fidelity [bond](../b/bond.md) can provide peace of mind to clients, assuring them that they are protected against potential theft or [fraud](../f/fraud.md) by the [business](../b/business.md)'s employees. This can enhance the company's reputation and build client [trust](../t/trust.md).

### 3. Regulatory Compliance

Certain types of fidelity bonds, such as ERISA bonds, are legally required. Compliance with these requirements can prevent legal repercussions and ensure the [business](../b/business.md) operates within regulatory boundaries.

### 4. Employee Accountability

The presence of a fidelity [bond](../b/bond.md) can serve as a deterrent to potential dishonest behavior by employees, as they are aware that fraudulent actions are covered by [insurance](../i/insurance.md), and such actions can be traced and prosecuted.

## How Fidelity Bonds Work

### Purchasing a Fidelity Bond

To purchase a fidelity [bond](../b/bond.md), a [business](../b/business.md) must apply to an [insurance](../i/insurance.md) company that offers such bonds. The application process typically involves a [risk](../r/risk.md) assessment of the [business](../b/business.md), which may include evaluating the nature of the [business](../b/business.md), its [internal controls](../i/internal_controls.md), the background of its employees, and its financial history.

### Premium Payment

Once the [bond](../b/bond.md) is underwritten, the [business](../b/business.md) pays a [premium](../p/premium.md) to the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) company. The [premium](../p/premium.md) amount depends on factors such as the size of the [bond](../b/bond.md) (the maximum coverage), the type of [bond](../b/bond.md), the nature of the [business](../b/business.md), and the [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with it. The [premium](../p/premium.md) is usually paid annually.

### Filing a Claim

If an employee commits a fraudulent act that results in a financial loss, the [business](../b/business.md) can file a claim on the fidelity [bond](../b/bond.md). The claim process involves providing evidence of the dishonest act, the financial loss it caused, and proof of the employee's involvement.

### Claim Investigation

The [insurance](../i/insurance.md) company [will](../w/will.md) conduct an investigation to verify the claim. This may require documentation, interviews, and other forms of evidence gathering. If the claim is validated, the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) company [will](../w/will.md) compensate the [business](../b/business.md) for the loss up to the limit of the [bond](../b/bond.md).

## Selecting the Right Fidelity Bond

When selecting a fidelity [bond](../b/bond.md), businesses should consider the following factors:

### 1. Type of Coverage

Choose a [bond](../b/bond.md) that aligns with the specific risks faced by the [business](../b/business.md). For example, a financial institution would benefit from a financial institution [bond](../b/bond.md), while a service provider might opt for a [business](../b/business.md) service [bond](../b/bond.md).

### 2. Coverage Amount

Assess the potential [financial exposure](../f/financial_exposure.md) and choose a coverage amount that adequately protects the [business](../b/business.md). This involves evaluating the [value](../v/value.md) of assets handled by employees and the potential impact of fraudulent acts.

### 3. Insurance Company Reputation

Select an [insurance](../i/insurance.md) company with a strong reputation and financial stability. This ensures that the company can effectively [handle](../h/handle.md) claims and provide the necessary support when needed. For reputable providers, visit companies like [Travelers](https://www.travelers.com) and [The Hartford](https://www.thehartford.com).

### 4. Policy Terms and Conditions

Review the terms and conditions of the [bond](../b/bond.md) policy, including exclusions, limitations, and claim procedures. Understand the responsibilities and [obligations](../o/obligation.md) under the [bond](../b/bond.md) to ensure compliance and effective use of the coverage.

## Fidelity Bond vs. Surety Bond

It's important to differentiate between fidelity bonds and [surety](../s/surety.md) bonds, as they serve different purposes within the realm of commercial [insurance](../i/insurance.md).

### Fidelity Bond

- **Purpose:** Protects the [business](../b/business.md) against financial loss due to employee dishonesty.
- **Parties Involved:** The [business](../b/business.md) (insured) and the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) company (insurer).
- **Claim Process:** The [business](../b/business.md) files a claim for [reimbursement](../r/reimbursement.md) after a loss is discovered.

### Surety Bond

- **Purpose:** Guarantees the fulfillment of contractual [obligations](../o/obligation.md), such as project completion or [payment](../p/payment.md) of suppliers.
- **Parties Involved:** The [principal](../p/principal.md) (party required to fulfill an obligation), the obligee (party protected by the [bond](../b/bond.md)), and the [surety](../s/surety.md) (entity issuing the [bond](../b/bond.md)).
- **Claim Process:** The obligee files a claim when the [principal](../p/principal.md) fails to meet contractual [obligations](../o/obligation.md), and the [surety](../s/surety.md) ensures the obligation is fulfilled or compensates the obligee.

## Case Studies

### 1. Banking Sector

In the banking sector, financial institution bonds are critical due to the high [volume](../v/volume.md) of transactions and sensitivity of financial information. A case where such bonds proved crucial involved a mid-sized [bank](../b/bank.md) where an employee embezzled funds over several years. The financial institution [bond](../b/bond.md) covered the losses, allowing the [bank](../b/bank.md) to recover financially without significant long-term damage.

### 2. Small Service Businesses

A small janitorial service company faced a situation where an employee was caught stealing valuable artwork from a client's [home](../h/home.md). The [business](../b/business.md) service [bond](../b/bond.md) kicked in, compensating the client for their loss and preserving the company's relationship with the client.

### 3. ERISA Compliance

A retirement [fund manager](../f/fund_manager.md) responsible for overseeing a substantial employee benefit plan committed [fraud](../f/fraud.md), leading to significant losses. The mandatory ERISA [bond](../b/bond.md) protected the beneficiaries by covering the losses, ensuring their retirement savings remained intact.

## Conclusion

Fidelity bonds play a crucial role in protecting businesses from financial losses due to employee dishonesty. By understanding the different types of fidelity bonds and their specific applications, businesses can make informed decisions to mitigate risks. [Investing](../i/investing.md) in the right fidelity [bond](../b/bond.md) not only provides financial protection but also enhances client [trust](../t/trust.md) and regulatory compliance, contributing to the overall stability and reputation of the [business](../b/business.md).

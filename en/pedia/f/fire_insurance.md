# Fire Insurance

### Definition and Purpose

Fire [insurance](../i/insurance.md) is a type of [property insurance](../p/property_insurance.md) that provides coverage against damage and losses caused directly by fire. This type of [insurance](../i/insurance.md) is essential for property owners as it helps to mitigate the [financial risk](../f/financial_risk.md) associated with fire-related incidents. Fire [insurance](../i/insurance.md) policies often cover not just the physical structure of a building but also its contents, ensuring that businesses, homeowners, and other property holders can recover financially after a fire.

### History

The concept of fire [insurance](../i/insurance.md) dates back to the Great Fire of London in 1666, which destroyed a large part of the city. Following this disaster, Nicholas Barbon set up the first fire [insurance](../i/insurance.md) company called “The Fire Office” in 1681. The idea was to create a [fund](../f/fund.md) that property owners could tap into if their properties were damaged by fire. Over the centuries, fire [insurance](../i/insurance.md) has evolved to cover a wide [range](../r/range.md) of perils and has become a critical component of [property insurance](../p/property_insurance.md) policies worldwide.

### Coverage

Fire [insurance](../i/insurance.md) typically covers:

1. **Damage to the Property:** This includes the main structure and any attached or detached structures such as garages and sheds.
2. **Contents of the Property:** This encompasses personal belongings, furniture, electronics, and other valuables.
3. **Additional Living Expenses:** If the insured property is rendered uninhabitable, the policy can cover the cost of temporary accommodations.
4. **Loss of Rental [Income](../i/income.md):** If the insured property is a rental, the policy can compensate for lost rental [income](../i/income.md) during the repair period.
5. **Firefighting Charges:** Sometimes, costs associated with firefighting activities such as water damage from hoses can also be covered.

### Exclusions

While fire [insurance](../i/insurance.md) provides extensive coverage, there are several exclusions that policyholders should be aware of:

1. **Intentional Acts:** Damage caused by intentional arson by the policyholder is not covered.
2. **War and Nuclear Risks:** Damages due to war, terrorism, or nuclear risks are typically excluded.
3. **Electrical Malfunctions:** Fire caused by electrical faults or malfunctions may not be covered unless specifically stated.
4. **Wear and Tear:** [Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) or wear and tear of the property that leads to a fire is not covered.
5. **Natural Disasters:** Many standard fire [insurance](../i/insurance.md) policies may not cover damages caused by natural disasters such as earthquakes or floods.

### Types of Fire Insurance Policies

1. **Valued Policy:** This type of policy covers a pre-determined sum, agreed upon at the time of taking the policy.
2. **Specific Policy:** This covers only a specific portion of the property and its contents up to a certain amount.
3. **Comprehensive Policy:** This type provides extensive coverage not just from fire, but also from other perils like theft, natural disasters, etc.
4. **Floating Policy:** Ideal for businesses with properties in various locations, this policy covers all properties under one sum assured.
5. **Replacement Policy:** This policy covers the [replacement cost](../r/replacement_cost.md), minus [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md), of the damaged property.

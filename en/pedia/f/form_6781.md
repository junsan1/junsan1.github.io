# Form 6781: Gains and Losses From Section 1256 Contracts and Straddles

Form 6781 is a form used by taxpayers in the United States to report gains and losses from section 1256 contracts and straddles. This form is typically utilized by individuals involved in trading or investing in futures contracts, options, and other similar financial instruments that fall under the specific rules of section 1256 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). The main purpose of Form 6781 is to ensure that such gains and losses are correctly reported to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax purposes.

## Overview of Section 1256 Contracts

Section 1256 contracts are a specific category of contracts that include regulated futures contracts, foreign currency contracts, non-equity options, dealer equity options, and dealer securities futures contracts. Under section 1256, these contracts are marked to market at the end of each tax year, meaning that they are treated as if they were sold at their fair market value on the last business day of the year. This process results in gains or losses that need to be reported on Form 6781. A unique feature of section 1256 contracts is the 60/40 tax treatment, where 60% of the gains or losses are treated as long-term capital gains or losses, and 40% are treated as short-term capital gains or losses, regardless of the actual holding period.

## Filling Out Form 6781

Form 6781 is divided into three parts:

### Part I: Section 1256 Contracts Marked to Market
- **Line 1**: Enter the net gain or loss from section 1256 contracts that have been marked to market.
- **Line 2**: Include any gains or losses carried over from prior years.
- **Line 3**: Sum the amounts on lines 1 and 2.
- **Line 4**: Allocate the total amount on line 3 into 60% long-term and 40% short-term capital gains or losses. Long-term gains or losses are reported on Schedule D (Form 1040), and short-term gains or losses are also reported on Schedule D.

### Part II: Gains and Losses From Straddles
- **Line 5**: Enter the identified straddle positions and their respective gains or losses.
- **Line 6**: Record any terminated straddle positions and their respective gains or losses.
- **Line 7**: Combine the amounts from lines 5 and 6 to determine the net gains or losses from straddles.
- **Line 8**: Include these amounts into the overall gains or losses reported on the tax return, ensuring they are correctly categorized for tax purposes.

### Part III: Unrecognized Gains From Positions Held on Last Business Day of the Year
- **Line 9**: If applicable, identify and report any unrecognized gains from positions held on the last business day of the year. These positions must be disclosed to ensure transparency and compliance with IRS regulations.

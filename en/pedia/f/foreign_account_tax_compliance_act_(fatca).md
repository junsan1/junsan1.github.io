# Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)

The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) is a United States federal law enacted in 2010 aimed at preventing [tax evasion](../t/tax_evasion.md) by U.S. taxpayers who [hold](../h/hold.md) financial assets outside the United States. FATCA imposes a comprehensive legal and regulatory framework designed to track and report on the foreign financial accounts and assets of U.S. persons. This act has significant implications not only for individual taxpayers but also for foreign financial institutions (FFIs) and other entities involved in handling U.S.-linked financial accounts.

## Overview

FATCA was signed into law on March 18, 2010, as part of the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment (HIRE) Act. Its primary objective is to combat [tax evasion](../t/tax_evasion.md) by requiring U.S. persons to report their financial accounts held outside of the United States and requiring foreign financial institutions (FFIs) to report to the Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Service (IRS) about their U.S. account holders. 

## Key Provisions

### Reporting Requirements for U.S. Persons

Individuals who are considered U.S. persons under FATCA must report their foreign financial accounts and assets. This is typically done through:

- **FBAR (Report of Foreign [Bank](../b/bank.md) and Financial Accounts)**: U.S. persons must file a FinCEN Form 114, commonly known as FBAR, if they have a financial [interest](../i/interest.md) in or signature authority over a foreign [financial account](../f/financial_account.md) exceeding certain thresholds.
- **Form 8938 (Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets)**: U.S. taxpayers must file this form with their annual [tax return](../t/tax_return.md) if the total [value](../v/value.md) of their specified foreign financial assets exceeds a specific threshold.

### Requirements for Foreign Financial Institutions (FFIs)

FFIs must identify and report information on their U.S. account holders to the IRS. This involves:
- **[Due Diligence](../d/due_diligence.md) Procedures**: FFIs are required to perform thorough [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md) to identify U.S. account holders.
- **Reporting Requirements**: FFIs must report certain information about their U.S. account holders to the IRS. This information includes the name, address, and [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) identification number (TIN) of each U.S. account holder, as well as the [account balance](../a/account_balance.md) and relevant financial details.
- **[Withholding](../w/withholding.md) Requirements**: FFIs that do not comply with FATCA's reporting requirements may face a 30% [withholding tax](../w/withholding_tax.md) on certain U.S. source payments, including [interest](../i/interest.md), dividends, and gross proceeds from the [sale](../s/sale.md) of U.S. securities.

### Intergovernmental Agreements (IGAs)

To facilitate FATCA compliance, the United States has entered into Intergovernmental Agreements (IGAs) with many countries. These agreements allow for the sharing of information between the tax authorities of the signatory countries, easing the burden on FFIs and ensuring the smooth implementation of FATCA regulations.

There are two types of IGAs:
- **Model 1 IGA**: Under this agreement, FFIs report information about U.S. account holders to their [local tax](../l/local_tax.md) authority, which then forwards the information to the IRS.
- **Model 2 IGA**: In this case, FFIs report directly to the IRS.

## Implications for Financial Institutions and Taxpayers

### Compliance Challenges

FATCA has introduced significant compliance challenges for both financial institutions and taxpayers. These include:
- **Data Management**: FFIs must implement [robust](../r/robust.md) systems for gathering, analyzing, and reporting data about their U.S. account holders. This requires significant investment in technology and personnel.
- **Legal and Regulatory Expertise**: Institutions must stay abreast of evolving FATCA regulations and ensure they comply with complex, multi-jurisdictional requirements.
- **Operational Costs**: The cost of implementing and maintaining FATCA compliance can be substantial. This includes costs associated with [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md), reporting, and potential [withholding](../w/withholding.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md).

### Taxpayer Impact

For U.S. taxpayers, FATCA introduces additional reporting requirements and potential penalties for non-compliance. This includes:
- **Increased Filing Burden**: Taxpayers must file additional forms and disclosures related to their foreign financial accounts and assets.
- **Penalties for Non-Compliance**: Failure to comply with FATCA requirements can result in significant fines and penalties, ranging from monetary penalties to criminal charges in cases of willful evasion.

### Case Studies

Several high-profile cases have illustrated the impact of FATCA and the IRS's commitment to enforcing compliance:

1. **[UBS](../u/ubs.md) Case**: In 2009, Swiss [bank](../b/bank.md) [UBS](../u/ubs.md) agreed to pay $780 million in fines, penalties, [interest](../i/interest.md), and restitution. [UBS](../u/ubs.md) also disclosed the identities and account details of approximately 4,450 U.S. clients to the IRS as part of the settlement.
   
2. **[Credit](../c/credit.md) Suisse Case**: In 2014, [Credit](../c/credit.md) Suisse pleaded guilty to criminal charges for helping U.S. clients evade [taxes](../t/taxes.md). The [bank](../b/bank.md) was fined $2.6 billion and required to provide detailed information about its U.S. account holders.

## Global Reaction and Criticism

FATCA has garnered both support and criticism globally. Key points of contention include:
- **Sovereignty Concerns**: Some countries argue that FATCA infringes on their sovereignty by imposing U.S. regulations extraterritorially.
- **Privacy Issues**: Privacy advocates have raised concerns about the extensive data sharing required under FATCA, which involves the transfer of sensitive financial information across borders.
- **Reciprocity**: Critics argue that while FFIs must report information about U.S. account holders, there is a lack of reciprocal information sharing about foreign nationals holding accounts in the U.S.

Despite these challenges, FATCA is credited with increasing [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and accountability in international [finance](../f/finance.md), prompting other jurisdictions to implement similar measures to combat [tax evasion](../t/tax_evasion.md) on a global scale.

## Conclusion

The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) represents a pivotal shift in global tax compliance, extending the reach of the U.S. tax system beyond its borders. Through stringent reporting requirements and international agreements, FATCA aims to curb [tax evasion](../t/tax_evasion.md) by U.S. taxpayers holding foreign financial assets. While the act imposes significant compliance burdens on financial institutions and individuals, it also underscores the importance of global cooperation in tackling financial crimes and ensuring tax compliance.

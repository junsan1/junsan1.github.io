# Financial Institution (FI)

A Financial Institution (FI) refers to a company that deals in monetary transactions, such as deposits, loans, investments, and currency exchange. FIs encompass a broad range of business operations within the financial services sector, including banks, trust companies, insurance companies, brokerage firms, and investment dealers. The role and functionality of financial institutions are crucial for economic stability and capital flow in both domestic and international markets. In particular, they serve as intermediaries that facilitate the flow of money within the financial system.

### Types of Financial Institutions

Financial Institutions are varied, and their functions can be categorized into several types based on the services they provide:

1. **Commercial Banks**: These are the most common financial institutions, providing services such as deposits, loans, and basic investment products. They operate on a margin between loan interest rates and deposit interest rates to generate profit.

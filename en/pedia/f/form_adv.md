# Form ADV

Form ADV is a critical document required by the U.S. Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) for investment advisors under the [Investment Advisers Act of 1940](../i/investment_advisers_act_of_1940.md). It serves [multiple](../m/multiple.md) key functions and is central to the regulatory framework governing the activities of investment advisory firms operating within the United States. This form provides a comprehensive overview of the advisor's background, [business](../b/business.md) practices, clientele, and any conflicts of [interest](../i/interest.md) that may arise due to their operations. It is also a required filing for advisors registering with state securities authorities. Form ADV has become instrumental in ensuring [transparency](../t/transparency.md), protecting investors, and maintaining the integrity of the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). 

## Overview and Purpose

The primary purpose of Form ADV is to provide a standardized method of disclosing important information about investment advisers to both the regulators and the public. This [transparency](../t/transparency.md) is aimed at allowing potential clients to make informed decisions when selecting an advisor and enabling regulators to monitor and enforce compliance with relevant laws and regulations. The form consists of [multiple](../m/multiple.md) parts, each serving a specific function:

1. **Part 1**: Provides basic [business](../b/business.md) information, including the advisor's name, [principal](../p/principal.md) office and place of [business](../b/business.md), ownership structure, executive officers, and disciplinary history. It also covers the types of advisory services offered and the assets under management.

2. **Part 2**: Known as the "brochure" section, this part is divided into Part 2A and Part 2B. Part 2A presents details about the advisor’s services, fees, and investment strategies in a narrative format that is designed to be easily readable by clients. Part 2B offers information about the background and qualifications of the personnel who [will](../w/will.md) be directly advising the client.

## Importance in Algorithimic Trading

For firms involved in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md)—where strategies are executed by pre-programmed computer instructions—[transparency](../t/transparency.md) and [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) are particularly crucial. [Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) firms often manage large volumes of trades executed at high speed, which can significantly impact [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md). Given the potential for complex and opaque [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), disclosures made through Form ADV are vital for understanding the [risk](../r/risk.md) profile of these firms and ensuring they adhere to [best practices](../b/best_practices.md) in [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) and client [transparency](../t/transparency.md).

## Example of a Firm Registration: Two Sigma Investments, LP

Two Sigma Investments, LP, a prominent [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) [firm](../f/firm.md), uses sophisticated computational models to [trade](../t/trade.md) various [asset](../a/asset.md) classes.

# Flotation Cost

[Flotation](../f/flotation.md) cost refers to the expenses incurred by a company when it issues new securities. This cost includes both direct expenses like [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) fees, legal fees, and registration fees, as well as indirect expenses like shifts in share price. [Flotation](../f/flotation.md) costs are most commonly associated with issuing new [equity](../e/equity.md) but can also apply when issuing [debt](../d/debt.md).

## Components of Flotation Cost

### 1. **Underwriting Fees:**
   These fees are paid to [investment banks](../i/investment_bank_(ib).md) or underwriters who manage the issuance process. Underwriters buy the issued securities from the company and resell them to the public or institutional investors. The [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) [fee](../f/fee.md) is typically a percentage of the total amount raised.

### 2. **Legal Fees:**
   Legal fees cover the cost of regulatory compliance and contract creation. Firms need legal advice to ensure that their issues follow all rules and regulations of the securities [market](../m/market.md).

### 3. **Registration Fees:**
   These fees are paid to the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) or equivalent regulatory bodies to register the new securities.

### 4. **Marketing and Administrative Costs:**
   The company may also incur [marketing](../m/marketing.md) and administrative costs to promote the new issuance and manage the process internally. These costs can include roadshows, [marketing](../m/marketing.md) materials, and internal labor.

### 5. **Price Impact:**
   Issuing new [equity](../e/equity.md) can result in a temporary decrease in the company's existing share price. This phenomenon is often referred to as "[market](../m/market.md) impact" or "price [dilution](../d/dilution.md)."

## Importance in Financial Decisions

[Flotation](../f/flotation.md) costs are crucial when corporations make [financing](../f/financing.md) decisions. Here's how:

### A. **Cost of Capital:**
   The inclusion of [flotation](../f/flotation.md) costs affects the [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md). For example, a higher [flotation](../f/flotation.md) cost would increase the cost of new [equity](../e/equity.md), thereby making [debt financing](../d/debt_financing.md) relatively cheaper. This could also influence the company’s [capital structure](../c/capital_structure.md).

### B. **Break-even Analysis:**
   Companies often conduct a [break-even analysis](../b/break-even_analysis.md) incorporating [flotation](../f/flotation.md) costs to determine how many securities need to be sold to cover these expenses and still meet the fundraising goals.

### C. **Net Raise Calculation:**
   The actual amount raised post the issuance is typically less than the gross amount due to [flotation](../f/flotation.md) costs. Therefore, [flotation](../f/flotation.md) costs need to be subtracted from the total raise to understand [net proceeds](../n/net_proceeds.md) accurately.

## Formula

The [flotation](../f/flotation.md) cost \( F \) as a percentage of the amount raised \( A \) can be formulated as:

\[ F = \frac{\text{Total [Flotation](../f/flotation.md) Costs}}{A} \]

For practical purposes when calculating [cost of equity](../c/cost_of_equity.md) or [cost of debt](../c/cost_of_debt.md), the [flotation](../f/flotation.md) cost is often included as an adjustment in the denominator.

### Example Calculation

Suppose a company plans to [issue](../i/issue.md) $1,000,000 in new [equity](../e/equity.md). The various [flotation](../f/flotation.md) costs are estimated as follows:

- [Underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) Fees = $50,000
- Legal Fees = $20,000
- Registration Fees = $10,000
- [Marketing](../m/marketing.md) and Administrative Costs = $5,000

Total [flotation](../f/flotation.md) costs = $85,000

\[ F = \frac{85,000}{1,000,000} = 8.5\% \]

Therefore, the [flotation](../f/flotation.md) cost percentage for this issuance is 8.5%.

## Application in Equity and Debt Issues

### Equity 
[Equity](../e/equity.md) issuance often involves higher [flotation](../f/flotation.md) costs compared to [debt](../d/debt.md). When evaluating a new [equity](../e/equity.md) issuance, companies must consider:

- **[Dilution](../d/dilution.md) Effect:** Existing shareholders can experience a [dilution](../d/dilution.md) in their ownership percentage.
- **[Market](../m/market.md) Perception:** Announcements of new [equity](../e/equity.md) issuance may affect [investor](../i/investor.md) sentiment and the company's stock price.

### Debt
[Debt](../d/debt.md) issuance usually has lower [flotation](../f/flotation.md) costs but involves other considerations like [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and [debt](../d/debt.md) covenants. When issuing new [debt](../d/debt.md):

- **[Credit Rating](../c/credit_rating.md):** A company’s [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) can impact the [interest](../i/interest.md) rates on the new [debt](../d/debt.md) and therefore affect [flotation](../f/flotation.md) costs.
- **Defaults & [Risk](../r/risk.md) Premiums:** Aspects like [default risk](../d/default_risk.md) and associated [risk](../r/risk.md) premiums can also come into play.

## Minimizing Flotation Costs

### 1. **Negotiation with Underwriters:**
   Companies can minimize [flotation](../f/flotation.md) costs by effectively negotiating terms and fees with underwriters.

### 2. **Cost-efficient Legal Advice:**
   Opting for more cost-effective yet compliant legal services can reduce legal expenses.

### 3. **Pre-planning and Efficiency:**
   Proper planning and efficient [execution](../e/execution.md) of the issuance process can minimize administrative and [marketing](../m/marketing.md) costs.

## Real-world Examples

### 1. **Tesla's Capital Raise:**
   Tesla Inc. issued approximately $2 billion in new [equity](../e/equity.md) in February 2020. Considering the [flotation](../f/flotation.md) costs, the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) expenses included [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md), legal, and [marketing](../m/marketing.md) fees, significantly impacting the [net proceeds](../n/net_proceeds.md).

### 2. **Apple's Debt Issuance:**
   Apple Inc. frequently issues bonds to [finance](../f/finance.md) its operations. In one of its significant [debt](../d/debt.md) offerings, Apple raised $7 billion in 2019. [Flotation](../f/flotation.md) costs were minimal compared to the [equity](../e/equity.md) issuance costs, making [debt](../d/debt.md) a more attractive option for the tech giant [Apple Inc.](https://www.apple.com).

## Conclusion

[Flotation](../f/flotation.md) costs are a fundamental consideration for any company looking to raise new [capital](../c/capital.md). They can significantly affect the [net proceeds](../n/net_proceeds.md) of the [issue](../i/issue.md), the company's [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md), and ultimately influence strategic financial decisions. Effective management of these costs through careful planning and [negotiation](../n/negotiation.md) can optimize the [capital](../c/capital.md)-raising process, allowing companies to achieve their financial goals more efficiently.

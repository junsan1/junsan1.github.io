2. **Corporate Income Tax**: A corporation with $1 million in profits calculates its tax liability based on the corporate tax rate and available deductions for business expenses and investments.
3. **Payroll Taxes**: An employee and their employer each pay a percentage of the employee's salary in payroll taxes to fund Social Security and Medicare.
4. **Excise Taxes**: A consumer purchasing gasoline pays an excise tax included in the price per gallon, which funds transportation infrastructure projects.

## Challenges
1. **Tax Evasion and Avoidance**: Ensuring compliance and minimizing tax evasion and avoidance to maximize revenue collection.
2. **Economic Cycles**: Managing fluctuations in federal income due to economic cycles, such as recessions and booms, which impact tax revenues.
3. **Tax Policy**: Balancing tax policies to promote economic growth, ensure fairness, and provide sufficient revenue for government needs.
4. **Budget Deficits**: Addressing budget deficits where government spending exceeds federal income, leading to increased borrowing and national debt.

## Conclusion
Federal income is a critical component of a nation's economic structure, providing the necessary funds for government operations and public services. It is primarily derived from taxes on individuals and businesses, with additional revenue from excise taxes, tariffs, and other sources. Effective management of federal income is essential for economic stability, equitable wealth distribution, and the provision of essential services to the public.

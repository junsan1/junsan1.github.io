# Form 4

Form 4, officially known as the "Statement of Changes in Beneficial Ownership," is a document that corporate insiders must file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) whenever they buy or sell company stock. It is a critical component for monitoring insider trading activities and is part of the legislative framework designed to promote transparency in the securities markets.

## Overview

Corporate insiders, such as directors, officers, and any beneficial owners of more than 10% of a company's stock, are required to report any changes in their ownership of the company's securities. Form 4 provides detailed information about these transactions, including:

1. **Identity of the Reporting Person**: The insider's name and relationship to the company.
2. **Date of Transaction**: The exact date when the transaction took place.
3. **Ownership Type**: Whether the transaction was a purchase, sale, or other acquisition or disposition.
4. **Security Type**: The class of security that is being bought or sold, such as common stock or preferred stock.
5. **Transaction Code**: A specific code that describes the nature of the transaction.
6. **Volume of Shares**: The number of shares involved in the transaction.
7. **Price of Shares**: The price at which the shares were acquired or sold.

## Legal Framework

Form 4 is mandated under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Section 16(a) rule requires timely disclosures of beneficial ownership and transactions to help deter and detect insider trading. According to the SEC, timely Form 4 filings contribute to the public's confidence in the integrity of the securities markets.

### Filing Deadlines

Under current SEC rules, Form 4 must be filed electronically within two business days following the execution of the transaction. The forms are immediately made available to the public on the SEC's EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval) database.

## Key Sections of Form 4

### Part I: Reporting Person

This section requires detailed identification of the insider, including the person's name, relationship to the company (e.g., director, officer, etc.), and the company’s name and trading symbol.

### Part II: Issuer and Ticker Symbol

This section captures information about the issuing company, including its name and ticker symbol. This is critical for identifying which company's securities are involved in the transaction.

### Part III: Transaction Information

This is the core of Form 4 and includes various tables where insiders detail their transactions. It includes the following fields:

- **Transaction Date**: The actual date the action occurred.
- **Deemed Execution Date**: If the transaction involved a derivative or any other form of indirect transaction, the deemed execution date is also listed.
- **Transaction Code**: A code that categorizes the nature of the transaction (e.g., P for Purchase, S for Sale, A for Awards, etc.).
- **Securities Acquired or Disposed Of**: The specific details about the securities, including the number of shares and the transaction price.
- **Share Ownership Following Transaction**: Insiders must disclose their total beneficial ownership after the reported transaction.
- **Nature of Ownership**: Indicates if the ownership is direct or indirect. Indirect ownership involves relationships where the insider owns stock through a trust, family member, or another entity.

## Importance of Form 4

The filed Form 4s are accessible to the public and serve multiple critical functions in the financial markets:

1. **Transparency**: Provides a window into the trading activities of corporate insiders, thus promoting market transparency.
2. **Market Sentiment**: Investors keenly watch Form 4 filings to gauge insider sentiment. Significant buying might suggest that insiders are confident in the company's future, while selling might suggest the opposite.
3. **Compliance**: Ensures that corporate insiders comply with federal securities laws.
4. **Fraud Prevention**: Helps in identifying potential cases of insider trading, which can be subject to legal scrutiny and penalties.

## Practical Examples

To illustrate how Form 4 works, consider these hypothetical scenarios:

### Example 1: Purchase of Shares

Jane Doe, a director at XYZ Corporation, purchases 1,000 shares of XYZ common stock at $50 per share on October 1, 2023. She must file Form 4 by October 3, 2023, detailing this transaction.

### Example 2: Award of Stock Options

John Smith, an officer of DEF Inc., is awarded 5,000 stock options with an exercise price of $20 per share on October 5, 2023. He must file Form 4 by October 7, 2023, to report the award.

### Example 3: Sale of Shares

Alice Johnson, a beneficial owner of more than 10% of GHI Tech, sells 3,000 shares at $35 per share on September 29, 2023. She must file Form 4 by October 1, 2023, disclosing the sale.

## Compliance and Enforcement

Failure to file Form 4 in a timely manner can result in civil penalties. The SEC actively monitors Form 4 filings and has the authority to take enforcement action against individuals who fail to comply with the requirements. Common enforcement actions include fines and penalties, which can be severe depending on the nature and extent of the violations.

The SEC has an Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, which provides resources and information for investors about Form 4 and other filings. Investors can access Form 4 filings through the SEC’s EDGAR database: [SEC EDGAR Database](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/webusers.htm).

# Form 4

Form 4, officially known as the "Statement of Changes in Beneficial Ownership," is a document that corporate insiders must file with the U.S. Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) whenever they buy or sell company stock. It is a critical component for monitoring [insider trading](../i/insider.md) activities and is part of the legislative framework designed to promote [transparency](../t/transparency.md) in the securities markets.

## Overview

Corporate insiders, such as directors, officers, and any beneficial owners of more than 10% of a company's stock, are required to report any changes in their ownership of the company's securities. Form 4 provides detailed information about these transactions, including:

1. **Identity of the Reporting Person**: The insider's name and relationship to the company.
2. **Date of [Transaction](../t/transaction.md)**: The exact date when the [transaction](../t/transaction.md) took place.
3. **Ownership Type**: Whether the [transaction](../t/transaction.md) was a purchase, [sale](../s/sale.md), or other [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) or [disposition](../d/disposition.md).
4. **[Security](../s/security.md) Type**: The class of [security](../s/security.md) that is being bought or sold, such as [common stock](../c/common_stock.md) or [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md).
5. **[Transaction](../t/transaction.md) Code**: A specific code that describes the nature of the [transaction](../t/transaction.md).
6. **[Volume](../v/volume.md) of [Shares](../s/shares.md)**: The number of [shares](../s/shares.md) involved in the [transaction](../t/transaction.md).
7. **Price of [Shares](../s/shares.md)**: The price at which the [shares](../s/shares.md) were acquired or sold.

## Legal Framework

Form 4 is mandated under Section 16(a) of the [Securities Exchange Act of 1934](../s/securities_exchange_act_of_1934.md). The Section 16(a) rule requires timely disclosures of beneficial ownership and transactions to help deter and detect [insider trading](../i/insider.md). According to the SEC, timely Form 4 filings contribute to the public's confidence in the integrity of the securities markets.

### Filing Deadlines

Under current SEC rules, Form 4 must be filed electronically within two [business](../b/business.md) days following the [execution](../e/execution.md) of the [transaction](../t/transaction.md). The forms are immediately made available to the public on the SEC's EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval) database.

## Key Sections of Form 4

### Part I: Reporting Person

This section requires detailed identification of the insider, including the person's name, relationship to the company (e.g., director, officer, etc.), and the company’s name and trading symbol.

### Part II: Issuer and Ticker Symbol

This section captures information about the issuing company, including its name and [ticker symbol](../t/ticker_symbol.md). This is critical for identifying which company's securities are involved in the [transaction](../t/transaction.md).

### Part III: Transaction Information

This is the core of Form 4 and includes various tables where insiders detail their transactions. It includes the following fields:

- **[Transaction](../t/transaction.md) Date**: The actual date the action occurred.
- **Deemed [Execution](../e/execution.md) Date**: If the [transaction](../t/transaction.md) involved a [derivative](../d/derivative.md) or any other form of indirect [transaction](../t/transaction.md), the deemed [execution](../e/execution.md) date is also [listed](../l/listed.md).
- **[Transaction](../t/transaction.md) Code**: A code that categorizes the nature of the [transaction](../t/transaction.md) (e.g., P for Purchase, S for [Sale](../s/sale.md), A for Awards, etc.).
- **Securities Acquired or Disposed Of**: The specific details about the securities, including the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) and the [transaction](../t/transaction.md) price.
- **Share Ownership Following [Transaction](../t/transaction.md)**: Insiders must disclose their total beneficial ownership after the reported [transaction](../t/transaction.md).
- **Nature of Ownership**: Indicates if the ownership is direct or indirect. Indirect ownership involves relationships where the insider owns stock through a [trust](../t/trust.md), family member, or another entity.

## Importance of Form 4

The filed Form 4s are accessible to the public and serve [multiple](../m/multiple.md) critical functions in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md):

1. **[Transparency](../t/transparency.md)**: Provides a window into the trading activities of corporate insiders, thus promoting [market](../m/market.md) [transparency](../t/transparency.md).
2. **[Market Sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md)**: Investors keenly watch Form 4 filings to gauge insider sentiment. Significant buying might suggest that insiders are confident in the company's future, while selling might suggest the opposite.
3. **Compliance**: Ensures that corporate insiders comply with federal securities laws.
4. **[Fraud](../f/fraud.md) Prevention**: Helps in identifying potential cases of [insider trading](../i/insider.md), which can be subject to legal scrutiny and penalties.

## Practical Examples

To illustrate how Form 4 works, consider these hypothetical scenarios:

### Example 1: Purchase of Shares

Jane Doe, a director at XYZ [Corporation](../c/corporation.md), purchases 1,000 [shares](../s/shares.md) of XYZ [common stock](../c/common_stock.md) at $50 per share on October 1, 2023. She must file Form 4 by October 3, 2023, detailing this [transaction](../t/transaction.md).

### Example 2: Award of Stock Options

John Smith, an officer of DEF Inc., is awarded 5,000 stock [options](../o/options.md) with an [exercise price](../e/excersise_price.md) of $20 per share on October 5, 2023. He must file Form 4 by October 7, 2023, to report the award.

### Example 3: Sale of Shares

Alice Johnson, a [beneficial owner](../b/beneficial_owner.md) of more than 10% of GHI Tech, sells 3,000 [shares](../s/shares.md) at $35 per share on September 29, 2023. She must file Form 4 by October 1, 2023, disclosing the [sale](../s/sale.md).

## Compliance and Enforcement

Failure to file Form 4 in a timely manner can result in civil penalties. The SEC actively monitors Form 4 filings and has the authority to take enforcement action against individuals who [fail](../f/fail.md) to comply with the requirements. Common enforcement actions include fines and penalties, which can be severe depending on the nature and extent of the violations.

The SEC has an Office of [Investor](../i/investor.md) Education and Advocacy, which provides resources and information for investors about Form 4 and other filings. Investors can access Form 4 filings through the SEC’s EDGAR database: [SEC EDGAR Database](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/webusers.htm).

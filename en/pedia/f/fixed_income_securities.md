# Fixed Income Securities

[Fixed income](../f/fixed_income.md) securities, sometimes referred to as bonds or [debt](../d/debt.md) securities, are a type of investment that yields regular returns in the form of [interest](../i/interest.md) or dividends. These are essentially loans made by an [investor](../i/investor.md) to a borrower (typically corporate or governmental), which pay fixed periodic [interest](../i/interest.md) payments and [return](../r/return.md) the [principal](../p/principal.md) upon [maturity](../m/maturity.md). This topic is essential for understanding various aspects of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and is particularly relevant for [risk-averse](../r/risk-averse.md) investors seeking stable returns.

## Types of Fixed Income Securities

1. **Government Bonds:** These bonds are issued by national governments and are considered low [risk](../r/risk.md).
   - **[U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) Securities:** Includes Treasury bills (T-bills), [Treasury notes](../t/treasury_notes.md) (T-notes), and Treasury bonds (T-bonds). [U.S. Treasury Department](https://home.treasury.gov/)
   - **[Gilts](../g/gilts.md):** Issued by the UK government.
   - **Bunds:** Issued by the German government.

2. **[Municipal Bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md):** Issued by states, cities, or other local government entities as a way to [finance](../f/finance.md) public projects like building schools, highways, or sewer systems. They are often exempt from federal [taxes](../t/taxes.md).

3. **Corporate Bonds:** These are issued by companies to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) for [expansion](../e/expansion.md), acquisitions, or other [business activities](../b/business_activities.md). They come in various forms:
   - **[Investment Grade](../i/investment_grade.md) Bonds:** Issued by companies with high [credit](../c/credit.md) ratings.
   - **High-[Yield](../y/yield.md) Bonds (Junk Bonds):** Issued by companies with lower [credit](../c/credit.md) ratings, carrying higher [risk](../r/risk.md) but potentially higher returns.

4. **Agency Bonds:** Issued by governmental agencies and government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) like Fannie Mae, [Freddie Mac](../f/freddie_mac.md), or the Federal [Home](../h/home.md) [Loan](../l/loan.md) Banks. 

5. **Convertible Bonds:** These can be converted into a predefined number of [common stock](../c/common_stock.md) [shares](../s/shares.md) of the issuing company, [offering](../o/offering.md) potential for [asset](../a/asset.md) appreciation.

6. **[Inflation-Linked Bonds](../i/inflation-linked_bonds.md):** These protect investors from [inflation](../i/inflation.md) as the [principal](../p/principal.md) is indexed to an [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rate. An example is the [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) [Inflation-Protected Securities](../i/inflation-protected_securities.md) (TIPS).

## Key Features of Fixed Income Securities

1. **[Coupon Rate](../c/coupon_rate.md):** The [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) paid by the [bond](../b/bond.md) [issuer](../i/issuer.md) on the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s [face value](../f/face_value.md).
2. **[Maturity Date](../m/maturity_date.md):** The date on which the [bond](../b/bond.md) [will](../w/will.md) repay its [principal](../p/principal.md) to the holder.
3. **[Principal](../p/principal.md) ([Face Value](../f/face_value.md)):** The amount of [money](../m/money.md) the [bondholder](../b/bondholder.md) [will](../w/will.md) receive back once the [bond](../b/bond.md) matures.
4. **[Yield](../y/yield.md):** The [return](../r/return.md) that the [bondholder](../b/bondholder.md) earns on the [bond](../b/bond.md).
   - **[Current Yield](../c/current_yield.md):** Annual coupon payments divided by the current [market price](../m/market_price.md).
   - **[Yield to Maturity](../y/yield_to_maturity.md) (YTM):** [Total return](../t/total_return.md) anticipated on a [bond](../b/bond.md) if held until [maturity](../m/maturity.md).
   - **[Yield to Call](../y/yield_to_call.md) (YTC):** [Yield](../y/yield.md) calculated considering the [bond](../b/bond.md) might be called before [maturity](../m/maturity.md).

5. **[Credit](../c/credit.md) Quality:** Indicates the [bond](../b/bond.md) [issuer](../i/issuer.md)'s ability to repay its [debt](../d/debt.md).
6. **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md):** Ease with which the [bond](../b/bond.md) can be sold before [maturity](../m/maturity.md) without affecting its price significantly.

## The Role of Rating Agencies

[Rating](../r/rating.md) agencies assess the [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) of the [bond](../b/bond.md) issuers. The ratings [range](../r/range.md) from high-grade (low [risk](../r/risk.md) of [default](../d/default.md)) to junk bonds (high [risk](../r/risk.md) of [default](../d/default.md)). The three primary [rating](../r/rating.md) agencies are:
- **Moody's:** [Moody's Investor Service](https://www.moodys.com/)
- **Standard & Poor's:** [S&P Global Ratings](https://www.spglobal.com/)
- **[Fitch Ratings](../f/fitch_ratings.md):** [Fitch Ratings](https://www.fitchratings.com/)

## Risks Associated with Fixed Income Securities

1. **[Interest Rate Risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md):** The [risk](../r/risk.md) that changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates [will](../w/will.md) affect the [bond](../b/bond.md)â€™s [value](../v/value.md).
2. **[Credit Risk](../c/credit_risk.md):** The [risk](../r/risk.md) that the [bond](../b/bond.md) [issuer](../i/issuer.md) [will](../w/will.md) [default](../d/default.md).
3. **[Inflation](../i/inflation.md) [Risk](../r/risk.md):** The [risk](../r/risk.md) that [inflation](../i/inflation.md) [will](../w/will.md) erode the [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) of the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s future payments.
4. **[Liquidity Risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md):** The [risk](../r/risk.md) that the [bondholder](../b/bondholder.md) [will](../w/will.md) not be able to sell the [bond](../b/bond.md) when desired without a significant price concession.
5. **[Reinvestment Risk](../r/reinvestment_risk.md):** The [risk](../r/risk.md) that the proceeds from a [bond](../b/bond.md) [will](../w/will.md) be reinvested at a lower [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md).

## Fixed Income Markets

- **[Secondary Market](../s/secondary_market.md):** Where pre-existing bonds are traded among investors.

## Investment Strategies in Fixed Income

### Buy and Hold

This strategy involves purchasing a [bond](../b/bond.md) and holding it until [maturity](../m/maturity.md), at which point the [principal](../p/principal.md) is repaid. It is suitable for conservative investors seeking steady [interest](../i/interest.md) [income](../i/income.md).

### Laddering

This strategy involves creating a portfolio of bonds with different maturities. As the short-term bonds mature, the proceeds are reinvested into new bonds. This method helps manage [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md) and provides [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).

### Barbell Strategy

This strategy involves [investing](../i/investing.md) in short-term and long-term bonds, avoiding intermediate maturities. It seeks to balance high yields from long-term bonds with the [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) of short-term bonds.

### Bullet Strategy

This strategy involves buying bonds that all mature around the same time. Investors use this to meet a predictable future financial obligation.

## The Role of Central Banks

Central banks, such as the Federal Reserve in the United States, influence [fixed income](../f/fixed_income.md) markets by setting [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and conducting [open market operations](../o/open_market_operations.md).

### Open Market Operations

Central banks buy and sell government securities in the [open market](../o/open_market.md) to control the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) and influence [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

### Quantitative Easing (QE)

During economic downturns, central banks may use QE to inject [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) into the [economy](../e/economy.md). They buy long-term securities to lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and increase the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md).

## Conclusion

[Fixed income](../f/fixed_income.md) securities [offer](../o/offer.md) various investment opportunities for different [risk](../r/risk.md) appetites and financial goals. Understanding their intricacies, the associated risks, and the impact of macroeconomic factors is essential for making informed investment decisions. Whether you're a conservative [investor](../i/investor.md) seeking stable returns or a more aggressive [investor](../i/investor.md) looking to diversify your portfolio, [fixed income](../f/fixed_income.md) securities can play a crucial role in your overall [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md).

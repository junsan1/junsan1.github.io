# Flexible Spending Account (FSA)

A Flexible Spending Account (FSA), also known as a Flexible Spending Arrangement, is a type of [savings account](../s/savings_account.md) that provides the account holder with specific tax advantages. This type of account is set up by an employer for employees to use to pay for various health-related expenses. Contributions to an FSA are made pre-tax, meaning that the [money](../m/money.md) put into the account is not subject to [payroll](../p/payroll.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md), providing a means for individuals to save [money](../m/money.md) on their health care costs and other eligible expenses.

## How FSAs Work

FSAs allow employees to contribute a portion of their regular [earnings](../e/earnings.md) to pay for qualified expenses related to medical and dental services. The maximum annual contribution limit is set by the IRS, and for the year 2023, the limit is $3,050. The funds contributed to an FSA can cover a wide [range](../r/range.md) of expenses, including but not limited to:

- Prescription medications
- Medical equipment and supplies
- Doctor co-pays and deductibles
- Dental treatments
- Vision care

One of the main attractions of an FSA is the [tax benefit](../t/tax_benefit.md). Since contributions are made on a pre-tax [basis](../b/basis.md), they reduce the account holder's [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md), which can result in significant tax savings. Additionally, withdrawals for eligible expenses are also [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md).

## Types of FSAs

There are mainly two types of FSAs:

1. **Health Care FSA**: This is the most common type, which covers medical, dental, and vision expenses that are not paid by [insurance](../i/insurance.md).
2. **Dependent Care FSA**: This applies to dependent care expenses such as daycare for children under 13, or care for a disabled spouse or dependent which allows the employee (and their spouse) to go to work.

### Limited Purpose FSA

There is also a Limited Purpose FSA, designed specifically for those who are enrolled in a Health [Savings Account](../s/savings_account.md) (HSA). This specialized FSA covers only dental and vision expenses.

## Eligible Expenses

The IRS publishes a list of eligible and ineligible expenses each year. Eligible expenses generally include:

- Medical services like doctor visits, hospital stays, and surgeries
- Dental procedures such as cleanings, fillings, and braces
- Vision care including eye exams, glasses, and contact lenses
- Prescription medications and over-the-counter drugs (with prescription)
- Mental health services

Ineligible expenses typically include:

- Cosmetic procedures
- Health club memberships
- Vitamins and supplements (unless prescribed)

## Use-It-or-Lose-It Rule

FSAs are subject to the "Use-It-or-Lose-It" rule, which means that any funds not used by the end of the plan year are forfeited. However, employers may [offer](../o/offer.md) one of two [options](../o/options.md) to mitigate this [risk](../r/risk.md): 

1. **Grace Period**: Employers can give employees up to an additional 2.5 months to use the funds after the plan year ends.
2. **Carryover**: Employers can allow employees to carry over up to $610 (as of 2023) to the next plan year.

Only one of these [options](../o/options.md) can typically be offered, not both.

## How to Access Funds

Employees can access their FSA funds in a few different ways:

- **[Debit](../d/debit.md) Card**: Some FSAs come with a [debit](../d/debit.md) card that can be used directly at the point of [sale](../s/sale.md) for eligible expenses.
- **[Reimbursement](../r/reimbursement.md)**: Employees can pay out-of-pocket for eligible expenses and then submit a claim for [reimbursement](../r/reimbursement.md) from the FSA.
- **Direct [Payment](../p/payment.md)**: Some FSAs may allow for direct [payment](../p/payment.md) to the service provider.

Employees are required to keep [receipts](../r/receipt.md) and may need to submit documentation to substantiate claims.

## Advantages of FSAs

- **Tax Savings**: Contributions reduce your [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md).
- **Upfront Funding**: The entire annual contribution is available at the beginning of the plan year, which can be advantageous for large expenses early in the year.
- **Employer Contributions**: Some employers may match employee contributions, though this is less common.

## Disadvantages of FSAs

- **Forfeiture of Unused Funds**: Due to the Use-It-or-Lose-It rule, any unused funds are forfeited at the end of the plan year or grace period.
- **Limited Flexibility**: Changes to contribution amounts can generally only be made during [open](../o/open.md) enrollment or due to a qualifying life event.

## Comparison to Health Savings Accounts (HSAs)

While both FSAs and HSAs [offer](../o/offer.md) tax advantages for medical expenses, there are distinct differences:

- **Eligibility**: HSAs are only available to individuals with high-deductible health plans (HDHPs), while FSAs are not tied to any specific type of [health insurance](../h/health_insurance.md).
- **Contribution Limits**: HSA contribution limits are generally higher than FSA limits.
- **Portability**: HSA funds roll over year to year and are owned by the account holder, while FSA funds are subject to forfeiture.
- **Investment Growth**: HSAs can be invested in mutual funds or other investment vehicles, allowing for [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md) growth, which is not an option with FSAs.

## Conclusion

Flexible Spending Accounts [offer](../o/offer.md) a [tax-advantaged](../t/tax-advantaged.md) way to cover medical and dependent care expenses. However, understanding the rules and limitations, particularly the Use-It-or-Lose-It rule, is crucial for making the most of an FSA. With careful planning, employees can significantly reduce their [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md) and out-of-pocket healthcare costs, making FSAs a valuable part of an employee benefits package.

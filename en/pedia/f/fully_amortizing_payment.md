# Fully Amortizing Payment

A fully amortizing [payment](../p/payment.md) refers to a periodic [loan](../l/loan.md) [payment](../p/payment.md), where if the borrower makes payments according to the [loan](../l/loan.md)’s [amortization schedule](../a/amortization.md), the [loan](../l/loan.md) [will](../w/will.md) be paid off by the end of its set term. Unlike [interest](../i/interest.md)-only loans, which require payments solely of [accrued interest](../a/accrued_interest.md) rather than [principal](../p/principal.md), fully amortizing loans incorporate both [interest](../i/interest.md) and [principal](../p/principal.md) reduction from the outset. These are typical of mortgages, car loans, and other personal loans designed to be settled over a predetermined period.

## Overview

The term "amortizing" comes from the Latin root "amort," meaning "to [kill](../k/kill.md)." In the context of [finance](../f/finance.md), to amortize a [loan](../l/loan.md) means to gradually write off the initial cost of the [asset](../a/asset.md) over the life of the [loan](../l/loan.md). A fully amortizing [loan](../l/loan.md) ensures the borrower completely retires the [debt](../d/debt.md) by the [loan](../l/loan.md)’s end.

With fully amortizing loans, each [payment](../p/payment.md) is allocated to both [interest](../i/interest.md) and the outstanding [loan](../l/loan.md) [principal](../p/principal.md). Initially, payments are [interest](../i/interest.md)-heavy; that is, a greater portion of the [payment](../p/payment.md) goes towards [interest](../i/interest.md). Over time, as the [principal](../p/principal.md) decreases, the [interest](../i/interest.md) portion of each [payment](../p/payment.md) reduces, while the [principal](../p/principal.md) portion increases. This structure is what defines an amortizing [loan](../l/loan.md).

## Characteristics

1. **Periodic Payments**: Borrowers make regular, scheduled payments (monthly, bi-weekly, etc.).
2. **Fixed Term**: The [loan](../l/loan.md) is designed to be paid off over a set term, like 15 years for a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md).
3. **[Interest](../i/interest.md) and [Principal](../p/principal.md)**: Payments contribute to both [interest](../i/interest.md) and [principal](../p/principal.md) from the beginning.
4. **Fixed vs. Variable Rate**: Loans can have fixed or variable [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

## Calculation of Fully Amortizing Payments

The calculation of a fully amortizing [payment](../p/payment.md) can be performed using the [present value of an annuity](../p/present_value_of_an_annuity.md) formula. The formula takes into account the [loan](../l/loan.md) amount ([principal](../p/principal.md)), the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md), and the [loan](../l/loan.md) term. The general formula for a fully amortizing monthly [payment](../p/payment.md) is:

\[ P = \frac{rPV}{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}} \]

Where:
- \(P\) is the monthly [payment](../p/payment.md).
- \(r\) is the monthly [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) (annual rate divided by 12).
- \(PV\) is the [loan](../l/loan.md) amount ([present value](../p/present_value.md)).
- \(n\) is the number of payments ([loan](../l/loan.md) term in years multiplied by 12).

## Pros and Cons

### Advantages

1. **Predictability**: Borrowers know exactly how much they owe each period, which helps with budgeting.
2. **[Equity](../e/equity.md) Building**: Paying down the [principal](../p/principal.md) increases the borrower’s [equity](../e/equity.md) in the property or [asset](../a/asset.md).
3. **Complete [Debt](../d/debt.md) [Repayment](../r/repayment.md)**: At the end of the [loan](../l/loan.md) term, the [debt](../d/debt.md) is fully paid off.
4. **[Amortization Schedule](../a/amortization.md)**: Provides a clear roadmap of how the [loan](../l/loan.md) is repaid over time, breaking down [interest](../i/interest.md) and [principal components](../p/principal_components_in_trading.md).

### Disadvantages

1. **Higher Initial Payments**: Compared to [interest](../i/interest.md)-only loans, fully amortizing loans typically require higher initial payments since they include both [interest](../i/interest.md) and [principal](../p/principal.md).
2. **Complexity**: Calculating the [amortization schedule](../a/amortization.md) can be complex without proper financial tools or software.
3. **Fixed [Obligations](../o/obligation.md)**: Borrowers are committed to fixed payments regardless of their financial situation changes.

## Practical Example

Suppose a borrower takes a $200,000 [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [loan](../l/loan.md) with a 30-year term at an annual [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) of 4.5%. To find the monthly [payment](../p/payment.md):

1. Convert the annual [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) to a monthly rate: \( \frac{4.5\%}{12} = 0.375\% \) or 0.00375.
2. Convert the [loan](../l/loan.md) term to the number of payments: \( 30 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 360 \text{ payments} \).

Using the amortization formula:

\[ P = \frac{0.00375 \times 200,000}{1 - (1 + 0.00375)^{-360}} \approx \$1013.37 \]

Thus, the borrower’s monthly [payment](../p/payment.md) is approximately $1013.37.

## Fully Amortizing Vs. Interest-Only Loans

While a fully amortizing [loan](../l/loan.md) incorporates both [interest](../i/interest.md) and [principal](../p/principal.md) in each [payment](../p/payment.md), an [interest](../i/interest.md)-only [loan](../l/loan.md) requires only [interest](../i/interest.md) payments for a given period. After this period, the [principal](../p/principal.md) balance must be paid either through a lump sum or subsequent larger payments. 

### Fully Amortizing Loans

- **[Payment](../p/payment.md) Structure**: Includes both [interest](../i/interest.md) and [principal](../p/principal.md).
- **Benefits**: Builds [equity](../e/equity.md), predictable payments, full [repayment](../r/repayment.md) by term’s end.
- **Risks**: Higher payments upfront compared to [interest](../i/interest.md)-only periods, less flexibility.

### Interest-Only Loans

- **[Payment](../p/payment.md) Structure**: Initially pays only the [interest](../i/interest.md).
- **Benefits**: Lower initial payments, potential to invest the difference elsewhere.
- **Risks**: Lump sum requirement, potential for higher future payments, does not build [equity](../e/equity.md) during [interest](../i/interest.md)-only period.

## Applications of Fully Amortizing Loans

### Residential Mortgages

Residential mortgages are probably the most common type of fully amortizing loans. Borrowers pay a fixed amount monthly over a span of 15 to 30 years, reducing the [principal](../p/principal.md) over time until it’s fully paid off by the end of the term. Banks such as [Wells Fargo](https://www.wellsfargo.com), for example, [offer](../o/offer.md) a variety of fully amortizing [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) products.

### Auto Loans

Auto loans are another example where fully amortizing payments are prevalent. Typically shorter-term (3-7 years), these loans also follow an [amortization schedule](../a/amortization.md) until the car is paid off. Companies like [Ford Credit](https://credit.ford.com) provide fully amortizing auto loans.

### Personal Loans

Banks and financial institutions provide personal loans that work similarly, designed to be amortized over periods ranging from a few months to several years. [SoFi](https://www.sofi.com), for instance, offers personal loans with fully amortizing [payment](../p/payment.md) structures.

### Commercial Loans

Businesses often use fully amortizing loans for [asset](../a/asset.md) purchases or other [capital](../c/capital.md) expenditures. For instance, companies might take out a [loan](../l/loan.md) to purchase new equipment, which is then paid off over several years. [Wells Fargo](https://www.wellsfargo.com) also offers commercial loans that are fully amortizing.

## Conclusion

Fully amortizing payments are a cornerstone of many lending products, ensuring that borrowers progressively pay down their [principal](../p/principal.md) and [interest](../i/interest.md) over time. This structure offers predictability, [equity](../e/equity.md) building, and a clear path to [debt](../d/debt.md) freedom, making it a popular choice for various types of loans from residential mortgages to personal loans. Understanding how fully amortizing payments work is crucial for both borrowers and lenders in managing and structuring [debt](../d/debt.md) effectively.

# Financial Accounting

Financial [accounting](../a/accounting.md) is a specialized branch of [accounting](../a/accounting.md) that is concerned with the recording, summarizing, and reporting of an organization's financial transactions. This information is then used to create [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) that can be examined by internal and external stakeholders to assess the organization's [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and performance. Let's delve into the topic in considerable detail.

## What is Financial Accounting?

Financial [accounting](../a/accounting.md) is the practice of preparing [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) that provide insights into the [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) and position of an organization. These [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) include the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md), [income statement](../i/income_statement.md), and [cash flow statement](../c/cash_flow_statement.md). The primary objective is to present an accurate and fair view of the company's [financial health](../f/financial_health.md).

## Core Principles of Financial Accounting

Financial [accounting](../a/accounting.md) is governed by a set of principles and standards to ensure consistency, reliability, and comparability of [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md). The most commonly followed standards include:

### Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)

GAAP is a set of [accounting](../a/accounting.md) standards and principles commonly used in the United States. They provide guidelines on how [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) should be prepared and presented. Some of the key principles under GAAP include:

- **[Revenue Recognition](../r/revenue_recognition.md) Principle**: Dictates when and how [revenue](../r/revenue.md) should be recognized (e.g., when it is earned and realizable).
- **Matching Principle**: Expenses should be matched with the revenues they help to generate.
- **[Historical Cost](../h/historical_cost.md) Principle**: Assets should be recorded based on their [original cost](../o/original_cost.md).
- **Full [Disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) Principle**: [Financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) should include all information necessary to understand an organization's financial position.

### International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)

IFRS is a set of [accounting](../a/accounting.md) standards developed by the International [Accounting](../a/accounting.md) Standards Board (IASB) that is used in over 140 jurisdictions worldwide. It aims to bring consistency and comparability in financial reporting globally. Some IFRS principles include:

- **[Fair Value](../f/fair_value.md) Measurement**: Assets and liabilities should sometimes be measured based on their [market value](../m/market_value.md) rather than [historical cost](../h/historical_cost.md).
- **Single Set of Standards**: IFRS aims to have a single set of high-quality, understandable, enforceable, and globally accepted standards.
- **[Transparency](../t/transparency.md)**: The standards are intended to enhance financial reporting [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and accountability.

## Financial Statements

Financial [accounting](../a/accounting.md) primarily focuses on the preparation and analysis of the following [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md):

### Balance Sheet

The [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md), also known as the statement of financial position, provides a snapshot of an organization’s assets, liabilities, and shareholders' [equity](../e/equity.md) at a specific point in time. The fundamental [accounting equation](../a/accounting_equation.md) that drives the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) is:

\[ \text{Assets} = \text{Liabilities} + \text{Shareholders' [Equity](../e/equity.md)} \]

### Income Statement

The [income statement](../i/income_statement.md), also known as the [profit](../p/profit.md) and loss statement, provides a summary of an organization’s revenues, expenses, and profits or losses over a specific period. It measures the organization’s [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) and comprises the following elements:

- **[Revenue](../r/revenue.md)**: [Income](../i/income.md) earned from the [sale](../s/sale.md) of goods or services.
- **Expenses**: Costs incurred in generating [revenue](../r/revenue.md).
- **Net [Income](../i/income.md)**: The difference between total [revenue](../r/revenue.md) and total expenses.

### Cash Flow Statement

The [cash flow statement](../c/cash_flow_statement.md) provides an analysis of the changes in an organization’s cash position over a particular period. It is divided into three sections:

- **[Operating Activities](../o/operating_activities.md)**: Cash flows from regular [business](../b/business.md) operations.
- **[Investing](../i/investing.md) Activities**: Cash flows from the purchase and [sale](../s/sale.md) of [long-term assets](../l/long-term_assets.md).
- **[Financing](../f/financing.md) Activities**: Cash flows from borrowing and repaying funds, issuing [shares](../s/shares.md), etc.

### Statement of Changes in Equity

The statement of changes in [equity](../e/equity.md) explains the changes in an organization’s [equity](../e/equity.md) during a particular [accounting](../a/accounting.md) period. It includes information on [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md), dividends, issuance of [shares](../s/shares.md), and other [equity](../e/equity.md)-related activities.

# Full-Time Day Trading

## Introduction to Day Trading

[Day trading](../d/day_trading.md) is a form of speculating in securities, in which traders buy and sell financial instruments within the same trading day, such that all positions are usually closed before the market closes for the day to avoid unmanageable risks and negative price gaps between one day's close and the next day's price at the open. Day traders utilize a variety of techniques and strategies to capitalize on short-term market movements. This practice requires substantial time, dedication, and a comprehensive understanding of the trade environment.

## Strategies Employed by Day Traders

### 1. Scalping

**Scalping** involves making numerous trades to capitalize on small price movements. Traders aim to make a substantial number of small profits, which, together, can result in significant gains by the end of the day. Scalping often requires [automated trading systems](../a/automated_trading_systems.md) and algorithms for execution due to the fast-paced nature of price movements.
  
**Key Techniques in Scalping:**
- **Spread Scalping:** Buying at the bid price and selling at the ask price to capture the spread.
- **Range Scalping:** Trading within predefined [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels to exploit recurring [price patterns](../p/price_patterns.md).

### 2. Momentum Trading

**[Momentum trading](../m/momentum_trading.md)** focuses on harnessing price movements:
- Identifying assets that are trending significantly in one direction with higher than average trading volumes.
- Utilizing [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and moving averages to confirm the momentum direction.
  
**Common Momentum Strategies:**
- **News-Based Trading:** Entering positions based on the impacts of breaking news or economic reports.
- **[Trend Following](../t/trend_following.md):** Combining [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) to follow established trends until signs of reversal.

### 3. Reversal Trading

**Reversal Trading** aims at identifying the points where trends are likely to reverse temporarily. The success lies in buying low and selling high, or vice versa, within these reversal points.

**Tools for Reversal Trading:**
- **[Candlestick Patterns](../c/candlestick_patterns.md):** Such as Engulfing patterns, Hammer, and Hanging Man.
- **Divergence Analysis:** Between price and [momentum indicators](../m/momentum_indicators.md) like MACD and RSI.

### 4. Range Trading

**[Range trading](../r/range_trading.md)** involves identifying common [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels where prices oscillate. Trades are made by buying near support and selling near resistance within a range-bound market environment.

**Critical Aspects:**
- **[Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md):** To identify overbought and oversold conditions.
- **[Volume Analysis](../v/volume_analysis.md):** To confirm the strength of [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md).

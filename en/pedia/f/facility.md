# Facility

## Definition
**Facility** in [finance](../f/finance.md) refers to a financial arrangement, such as a [loan](../l/loan.md) or line of [credit](../c/credit.md), provided by a financial institution to a borrower. It is designed to [offer](../o/offer.md) flexibility and support to businesses and individuals in managing their financial needs. Facilities can also refer to physical infrastructures, such as buildings and equipment, used in the operation of a [business](../b/business.md).

## Types of Financial Facilities

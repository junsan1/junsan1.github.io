# Facility

## Definition
**Facility** in finance refers to a financial arrangement, such as a loan or line of credit, provided by a financial institution to a borrower. It is designed to offer flexibility and support to businesses and individuals in managing their financial needs. Facilities can also refer to physical infrastructures, such as buildings and equipment, used in the operation of a business.

## Types of Financial Facilities

2. **Line of Credit**: A flexible borrowing option that allows the borrower to draw funds up to a specified limit as needed. Interest is paid only on the amount drawn.
3. **Revolving Credit Facility**: Similar to a line of credit, it provides ongoing access to funds that can be borrowed, repaid, and borrowed again up to a set limit. Commonly used by businesses to manage cash flow.
4. **Trade Finance Facility**: Provides funding for international trade transactions, including letters of credit, export financing, and import financing.
5. **Bridge Loan**: A short-term loan designed to provide temporary financing until permanent financing is secured.

2. **Interest Rate**: The cost of borrowing the principal, usually expressed as an annual percentage rate (APR).
3. **Repayment Terms**: The schedule and conditions under which the borrowed funds must be repaid.

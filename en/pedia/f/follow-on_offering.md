# Follow-On Offering

A Follow-On [Offering](../o/offering.md) (FPO), also known as a Follow-On Public [Offer](../o/offer.md), is a public issuance of additional [shares](../s/shares.md) after a company has already had an Initial Public [Offering](../o/offering.md) (IPO). It provides a significant method for companies to raise additional [capital](../c/capital.md) from the public. This process is crucial for companies looking to expand, pay down [debt](../d/debt.md), or [finance](../f/finance.md) other significant projects without incurring more [debt](../d/debt.md).

## Types of Follow-On Offerings

There are two primary types of Follow-On Offerings:

1. **Dilutive Follow-On [Offering](../o/offering.md)**: In a dilutive Follow-On, the company issues new [shares](../s/shares.md) in the [market](../m/market.md), which increases the total number of [shares](../s/shares.md) outstanding. This can dilute the [earnings](../e/earnings.md) per share (EPS) as the [earnings](../e/earnings.md) [will](../w/will.md) now be spread across a larger number of [shares](../s/shares.md). However, this type of [offering](../o/offering.md) raises new [capital](../c/capital.md) for the company's [expansion](../e/expansion.md) and development.

2. **Non-Dilutive Follow-On [Offering](../o/offering.md)**: In a non-dilutive Follow-On, existing shareholders sell their [shares](../s/shares.md) in the [market](../m/market.md), which does not increase the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) outstanding or raise new [capital](../c/capital.md) for the company. Instead, this type of [offering](../o/offering.md) provides [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) for existing shareholders.

### Process of Follow-On Offering

1. **Decision Making**: The company's board of directors and management decide to proceed with a Follow-On [Offering](../o/offering.md) based on strategic financial goals such as [capital](../c/capital.md) [expansion](../e/expansion.md), [debt](../d/debt.md) [repayment](../r/repayment.md), or other significant investments.

2. **Regulatory Filing**: Companies must file necessary documentation with the relevant securities regulatory bodies. In the United States, this involves submitting a registration statement with the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC). This document provides detailed information about the company, the reasons for the [offering](../o/offering.md), and the risks involved.

3. **[Underwriting](../u/underwriting.md)**: The company typically works with [investment banks](../i/investment_bank_(ib).md) that act as underwriters. These underwriters purchase the [shares](../s/shares.md) from the company at a [discount](../d/discount.md) and then sell them to the public at the [offering price](../o/offering_price.md). The underwriters play a crucial role in ensuring the [offering](../o/offering.md) proceeds smoothly and in determining the price at which the [shares](../s/shares.md) are offered to the public.

4. **[Marketing](../m/marketing.md) the [Offering](../o/offering.md)**: The underwriters and the company may engage in a "[roadshow](../r/roadshow.md)," where they present the [offering](../o/offering.md) to potential investors to drum up [interest](../i/interest.md) and sales. This process helps in establishing the [demand](../d/demand.md) and pricing for the new [shares](../s/shares.md).

5. **Pricing**: The price of the new [shares](../s/shares.md) is typically set just before the public announcement and is influenced by various factors, including the current [market price](../m/market_price.md) of the [shares](../s/shares.md), [investor](../i/investor.md) [demand](../d/demand.md), and overall [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

6. **Settlement**: Once the [shares](../s/shares.md) are sold to the public, the regulators must finalize the paperwork, and the proceeds are then transferred to the company. This process usually takes a few days to complete.

### Advantages of Follow-On Offering

- **[Capital](../c/capital.md) Raising**: It allows companies to raise substantial [capital](../c/capital.md) without incurring [debt](../d/debt.md).
- **Growth and [Expansion](../e/expansion.md)**: Enables companies to undertake significant projects or expand their [business](../b/business.md) operations.
- **Improving [Debt](../d/debt.md)-[Equity](../e/equity.md) Ratio**: Helps in strengthening the company's [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) by improving its [debt](../d/debt.md)-[equity](../e/equity.md) ratio if proceeds are used to pay down existing [debt](../d/debt.md).
- **[Market](../m/market.md) Awareness**: Boosts the company's [visibility](../v/visibility.md) and credibility in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

### Risks and Disadvantages of Follow-On Offering

- **[Dilution](../d/dilution.md) of Share [Value](../v/value.md)**: The issuance of additional [shares](../s/shares.md) can dilute the [value](../v/value.md) of existing [shares](../s/shares.md) if the new [shares](../s/shares.md) represent a significant proportion of the total [shares](../s/shares.md) outstanding.
- **[Market Sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md)**: The perception of why the company is raising funds (e.g., [financial distress](../f/financial_distress.md) vs. [expansion](../e/expansion.md)) can significantly impact the companyâ€™s stock price.
- **[Shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) Approval**: Companies may need to obtain approval from existing shareholders, which could be challenging.
- **[Market](../m/market.md) Conditions**: Adverse [market](../m/market.md) conditions can impact the success and pricing of the Follow-On [Offering](../o/offering.md).

In conclusion, Follow-On Offerings serve as a vital mechanism for companies looking to access additional [equity](../e/equity.md) from public markets. While they [offer](../o/offer.md) significant benefits in terms of [capital](../c/capital.md) raising and strategic growth, they also come with risks that companies need to carefully manage.

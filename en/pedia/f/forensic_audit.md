# Forensic Audit

## Introduction to Forensic Audit

A forensic audit is an examination and evaluation of an individual or organization's financial information for use as evidence in a court of law. A forensic audit can be conducted in three primary types of scenarios: investigating [fraud](../f/fraud.md), detecting financial misstatements, and resolving disputes among [business](../b/business.md) parties.

## Objectives of Forensic Audit

The primary objectives of a forensic audit include:

1. Detection of [fraud](../f/fraud.md) and financial crimes.
2. Collecting evidence that is legally sound and can be presented in court.
3. Minimizing the [risk](../r/risk.md) of recurrence of financial misconduct.
4. Scrutinizing [internal controls](../i/internal_controls.md) and recommending improvements to prevent future [fraud](../f/fraud.md).
5. Assisting stakeholders in understanding the nature and implications of the financial discrepancies uncovered.

## Types of Forensic Audits

1. **[Fraud](../f/fraud.md) Investigations:** Identifying significant irregularities, fraudulent financial activities, and manipulations within an organization. This is the most common type of forensic audit.
   
2. **[Bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) Cases:** Examining a bankrupt company’s [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) to determine the reasons for its [financial distress](../f/financial_distress.md) and ensure there has been no misconduct by the management.
   
3. **Medical Claims Audit:** Involves investigating billing practices and claims lodged with [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies to identify fraudulent claims and billing errors.
   
4. **[Royalty](../r/royalty.md) Audits:** Ensuring that a company complies with [royalty](../r/royalty.md) agreements and accurately reports and pays royalties. 

5. **[Shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) and Partnership Disputes:** Assessing possible financial mismanagement and its impact on the shareholders or partners.

## Phases of Forensic Audits

- **Reviewing [Internal Controls](../i/internal_controls.md):** Evaluating the organization’s [internal controls](../i/internal_controls.md) to discover weaknesses that could have allowed the [fraud](../f/fraud.md) to occur.

# Federal Trade Commission (FTC)

The Federal [Trade](../t/trade.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (FTC) is an independent agency of the United States government, established in 1914 by the Federal [Trade](../t/trade.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) Act. Its [principal](../p/principal.md) mission is the promotion of consumer protection and the elimination and prevention of anticompetitive [business](../b/business.md) practices, such as coercive [monopoly](../m/monopoly.md). The FTC works to ensure that the United States markets function competitively and are free of undue restrictions. In doing so, it enforces a variety of consumer protection laws and regulations, investigates consumer complaints, and educates both consumers and businesses.

## Historical Background

The FTC was created during the Progressive Era, a period marked by widespread social activism and political reform across the United States. President Woodrow Wilson signed the Federal [Trade](../t/trade.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) Act into law on September 26, 1914. The creation of the FTC was partly in response to the inadequacies of the [Sherman Antitrust Act](../s/sherman_antitrust_act.md) of 1890, which was the first federal act that outlawed monopolistic [business](../b/business.md) practices. 

## Organizational Structure

The FTC is led by a [Commission](../c/commission.md) consisting of five members, each nominated by the President of the United States and confirmed by the Senate for seven-year terms. No more than three commissioners can be from the same political party at any one time, ensuring a degree of political balance. The President designates one of the commissioners to serve as the Chair.

## Primary Functions

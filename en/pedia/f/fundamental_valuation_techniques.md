# Fundamental Valuation Techniques

Fundamental [valuation techniques](../v/valuation_techniques.md) are methodologies used to determine the [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) of an [asset](../a/asset.md), typically a financial [security](../s/security.md), by examining related economic, financial, and other qualitative and quantitative factors. These factors include company [earnings](../e/earnings.md), [revenue](../r/revenue.md), [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md), [industry](../i/industry.md) [statistics](../s/statistics.md), and qualitative information like management quality. [Fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md) aims to forecast a [security](../s/security.md)'s future price movements based on [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [business](../b/business.md) performance and [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md). Here we delve into the primary fundamental [valuation techniques](../v/valuation_techniques.md) commonly used in [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md):

### 1. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

Discounted [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md) (DCF) analysis is a [valuation](../v/valuation.md) method used to estimate the [value](../v/value.md) of an investment based on its expected future cash flows. The DCF model involves [forecasting](../f/forecasting.md) the free cash flows the investment [will](../w/will.md) generate and then [discounting](../d/discounting.md) them back to their [present value](../p/present_value.md) using an appropriate [discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md). The formula for DCF is:

\[ DCF = \sum \frac{FCF_t}{(1 + r)^t} \]

Where:
- \( FCF_t \) = Free [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md) at time 't'
- \( r \) = [Discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md)
- \( t \) = time period

Key components in DCF analysis include:

- **[Forecasting](../f/forecasting.md) Cash Flows:** Estimating the future cash flows of the [asset](../a/asset.md).
- **[Discount Rate](../d/discount_rate.md):** Determining the rate that reflects the [risk](../r/risk.md) of the cash flows.
- **Terminal [Value](../v/value.md):** Estimating the [value](../v/value.md) of cash flows beyond the forecast period.

### 2. Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio

The Price-to-[Earnings](../e/earnings.md) (P/E) ratio is a popular [valuation](../v/valuation.md) metric that compares a company's current share price to its per-share [earnings](../e/earnings.md). It is calculated as:

\[ P/E = \frac{Market \, Value \, per \, Share}{[Earnings](../e/earnings.md) \, per \, Share (EPS)} \]

A high P/E ratio may indicate that the [market](../m/market.md) expects future growth, while a low P/E ratio might suggest the stock is [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) or that the company is experiencing issues. 

### 3. Enterprise Value (EV) to EBITDA

The EV/EBITDA [multiple](../m/multiple.md) is often used to [value](../v/value.md) companies by comparing their Enterprise [Value](../v/value.md) (EV) to [Earnings](../e/earnings.md) Before [Interest](../i/interest.md), [Taxes](../t/taxes.md), [Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md), and Amortization (EBITDA). The formula is:

\[ EV/EBITDA = \frac{Enterprise \, Value}{Earnings \, Before \, Interest, \, Taxes, \, [Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md), \, and \, Amortization} \]

Enterprise [Value](../v/value.md) (EV) is calculated as:

\[ EV = Market \, [Capitalization](../c/capitalization.md) + Total \, [Debt](../d/debt.md) - Cash \& Cash \, Equivalents \]

This ratio provides a more comprehensive measure than P/E as it includes [debt](../d/debt.md) and excludes non-cash charges.

### 4. Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio

The Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio calculates a company's [market value](../m/market_value.md) relative to its [book value](../b/book_value.md). The formula is:

\[ P/B = \frac{[Market](../m/market.md) \, [Value](../v/value.md) \, per \, Share}{Book \, [Value](../v/value.md) \, per \, Share} \]

This ratio helps investors understand if a stock is trading above or below the [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) of its [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets.

### 5. Dividend Discount Model (DDM)

The [Dividend](../d/dividend.md) [Discount](../d/discount.md) Model (DDM) values a stock based on the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of all future dividends. The simplest form, the [Gordon Growth Model](../g/gordon_growth_model.md), assumes dividends [will](../w/will.md) grow at a constant rate. The formula is:

\[ P = \frac{D_0 \times (1+g)}{r - g} \]

Where:
- \( P \) = Price of the stock
- \( D_0 \) = Current [dividend](../d/dividend.md)
- \( g \) = Expected growth rate of dividends
- \( r \) = Required [rate of return](../r/rate_of_return.md)

### 6. Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE)

Free [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md) to [Equity](../e/equity.md) (FCFE) represents the cash available to [equity](../e/equity.md) shareholders after all expenses, [reinvestment](../r/reinvestment.md), and [debt](../d/debt.md) repayments. The [valuation](../v/valuation.md) formula is similar to the DCF but focuses on [equity](../e/equity.md) cash flows:

\[ FCFE = \sum \frac{FCFE_t}{(1 + r)^t} \]

By [discounting](../d/discounting.md) FCFE, one can estimate the [equity](../e/equity.md) [value](../v/value.md) of the company.

### 7. Relative Valuation

Relative [valuation](../v/valuation.md) compares a companyâ€™s metrics to those of similar companies or the [industry](../i/industry.md) average. Common relative [valuation multiples](../v/valuation_multiples.md) include P/E, P/B, EV/EBITDA, and Price-to-Sales (P/S). This approach helps identify whether a stock is over- or [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) relative to its peers.

### 8. Economic Value Added (EVA)

[Economic Value](../e/economic_value.md) Added (EVA) measures a company's [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) based on residual [wealth](../w/wealth.md) created over the [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md). The formula is:

\[ EVA = NOPAT - (WACC \times [Capital](../c/capital.md) \, Invested) \]

Where:
- \( NOPAT \) = Net [Operating Profit](../o/operating_profit.md) After [Taxes](../t/taxes.md)
- \( WACC \) = [Weighted Average](../w/weighted_average.md) [Cost of Capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md)

EVA indicates if the company is generating [value](../v/value.md) beyond the required [return](../r/return.md) of investors.

### 9. Residual Income Model

The [Residual Income](../r/residual_income.md) Model values a company based on the [income](../i/income.md) remaining after [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for the [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md). The formula is:

\[ Residual \, Income = Net \, Income - (Equity \, [Capital](../c/capital.md) \times Cost \, of \, [Equity](../e/equity.md)) \]

This method highlights the profitability of a company after covering the [cost of equity](../c/cost_of_equity.md).

### 10. Gordon Growth Model (GGM)

The [Gordon Growth Model](../g/gordon_growth_model.md), a type of [Dividend](../d/dividend.md) [Discount](../d/discount.md) Model, estimates the [value](../v/value.md) of a stock by assuming dividends [will](../w/will.md) grow at a constant rate in [perpetuity](../p/perpetuity.md). Its formula is:

\[ P_0 = \frac{D_1}{r - g} \]

Where \( P_0 \) is the current stock price, \( D_1 \) is the [dividend](../d/dividend.md) in the next period, \( r \) is the required [rate of return](../r/rate_of_return.md), and \( g \) is the growth rate of dividends.

## FF&E Valuation and Accounting

### Valuation

FF&E [valuation](../v/valuation.md) is a critical process for property sales, mergers, and acquisitions. [Valuation](../v/valuation.md) typically involves assessing the current [market value](../m/market_value.md) of the FF&E assets considering [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) and current condition. Common methods include:
- **Cost Approach**: Evaluating the [replacement cost](../r/replacement_cost.md) new minus any [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md).
- **[Market Approach](../m/market_approach.md)**: Comparing with similar items sold in the [market](../m/market.md).
- **[Income Approach](../i/income_approach.md)**: Estimating the [value](../v/value.md) based on the [revenue](../r/revenue.md)-generating capability of the FF&E assets.

### Accounting

In [accounting](../a/accounting.md), FF&E is typically capitalized on the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) as property, plant, and equipment (PPE). They are usually subject to [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) over their [useful life](../u/useful_life.md). Key [accounting](../a/accounting.md) standards that deal with FF&E include:
- **IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards)**: IAS 16 outlines the [accounting](../a/accounting.md) treatment for property, plant, and equipment.

[Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) methods often used include:
- **Straight-Line [Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md)**: Spreading the cost evenly over the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s [useful life](../u/useful_life.md).
- **Declining Balance [Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md)**: Accelerating [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) in the earlier years of the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s life.

# Form 1095-B

Form 1095-B, issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), is a tax form used to report information about individuals' health insurance coverage. This form is utilized primarily to demonstrate that an individual has had minimum essential coverage (MEC) throughout the year, as required by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The goal is to help the IRS verify that taxpayers and their dependents have compliance with the health insurance mandate.

## Purpose of Form 1095-B

Form 1095-B serves several key purposes:
1. It confirms that an individual has had MEC for each month of the year, thus avoiding the individual shared responsibility payment (penalty).
2. It provides the IRS with information on the type of health insurance coverage provided, including the insurer and the covered individuals.
3. It helps individuals confirm their health insurance status for their own records and tax filing purposes.

## Who Receives Form 1095-B?

Generally, Form 1095-B is issued by health insurance providers, including:
- Health insurance companies that provide individual marketplace plans.
- Government-sponsored programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP.
- Certain self-funded employers and small employers who are not required to provide Form 1095-C.
- Other entities providing MEC.

Individuals typically receive this form if they are enrolled in any of the above types of health plans.

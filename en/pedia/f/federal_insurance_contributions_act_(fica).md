# Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA)

The Federal [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) Contributions Act (FICA) is a United States federal [payroll](../p/payroll.md) (or employment) tax imposed on both employees and employers to [fund](../f/fund.md) [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) and Medicare programs. These programs provide benefits for retirees, disabled individuals, and children of deceased workers. The main components of FICA are the [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) tax and the Medicare tax, and in this detailed exploration, we [will](../w/will.md) discuss the structure, implications, and significance of FICA in the U.S. [economy](../e/economy.md).

## Components of FICA

### Social Security Tax
The [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) tax is collected to [fund](../f/fund.md) the [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) program, which provides retirement, disability, and survivor benefits. The [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md) for [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) is 6.2% for employees and 6.2% for employers, totaling 12.4%. As of 2023, the [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) tax applies to [income](../i/income.md) up to $160,200. [Earnings](../e/earnings.md) above this threshold are not subject to the [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) tax.

### Medicare Tax
The Medicare tax funds the Medicare program, which provides hospital [insurance](../i/insurance.md) (Part A) and supplementary medical [insurance](../i/insurance.md) (Part B). The [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md) for Medicare is 1.45% for employees and 1.45% for employers, totaling 2.9%. Unlike the [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) tax, there is no [income](../i/income.md) limit for the Medicare tax, meaning it applies to all [earnings](../e/earnings.md). Additionally, individuals earning above a certain threshold ($200,000 for single filers and $250,000 for married couples filing jointly as of 2023) are subject to an additional 0.9% Medicare surtax on the [income](../i/income.md) above these thresholds.

## Calculation and Collection of FICA Taxes

### Employee's Contribution
For an employee, the employer withholds the FICA [taxes](../t/taxes.md) from the employee's paycheck. For example, if an employee earns $1,000, the employer withholds 6.2% for [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) ($62) and 1.45% for Medicare ($14.50), totaling $76.50 in FICA [taxes](../t/taxes.md). If the employee's [earnings](../e/earnings.md) exceed the Medicare surtax threshold, the additional 0.9% is also withheld.

### Employer's Contribution
Employers are required to match the employee's contribution, meaning they also pay 6.2% for [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) and 1.45% for Medicare on the employee's [earnings](../e/earnings.md). Therefore, using the example above, the employer would also contribute $62 for [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) and $14.50 for Medicare, making the total FICA tax [payment](../p/payment.md) $153.

### Self-employed Individuals
Self-employed individuals are responsible for both the employee and employer portions of the FICA [taxes](../t/taxes.md), known as the [self-employment](../s/self-employment.md) tax. As such, they pay 12.4% for [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) and 2.9% for Medicare on their net [earnings](../e/earnings.md). However, self-employed individuals can deduct half of the [self-employment](../s/self-employment.md) tax when calculating their adjusted [gross income](../g/gross_income.md), acknowledging the employer's share of the tax.

## Implications of FICA Taxes

### Social Security Benefits
FICA [taxes](../t/taxes.md) directly [fund](../f/fund.md) [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) benefits. Workers earn "credits" based on their FICA-taxed [earnings](../e/earnings.md), with up to four credits earned per year. In 2023, a worker earns one [credit](../c/credit.md) for each $1,640 of [earnings](../e/earnings.md), up to the maximum of four credits for $6,560 or more. Generally, a worker needs 40 credits (or ten years of work) to qualify for [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) benefits. The amount of the benefit depends on the worker's [earnings](../e/earnings.md) history and the age at which they begin to receive benefits.

### Medicare Coverage
Medicare [taxes](../t/taxes.md) [fund](../f/fund.md) hospital [insurance](../i/insurance.md) for individuals aged 65 or older and certain younger individuals with disabilities. Medicare Part A covers inpatient hospital care, skilled nursing [facility](../f/facility.md) care, hospice care, and some [home](../h/home.md) health care. Part B covers outpatient care, preventive services, and some [home](../h/home.md) health services.

## Economic Impact of FICA

### Funding Social Safety Nets
FICA [taxes](../t/taxes.md) provide a critical funding mechanism for [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) and Medicare, which are essential social safety nets in the United States. These programs help reduce [poverty](../p/poverty.md) among the elderly and provide healthcare to millions of Americans.

### Employer Costs
The employer-matching requirement imposes a cost on employers, potentially influencing hiring decisions. Small businesses, in particular, may feel the financial strain of the employer's share of FICA [taxes](../t/taxes.md). However, these [taxes](../t/taxes.md) are a necessary investment in the [social welfare system](../s/social_welfare_system.md), providing long-term benefits to society.

### Tax Policy Debate
FICA [taxes](../t/taxes.md) are often a subject of debate in tax policy discussions. Some argue that increasing the [income](../i/income.md) cap for [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) or adjusting the tax rates could address funding shortfalls in [Social Security](../s/social_security.md). Others advocate for reforms to ensure the sustainability of these programs without overburdening workers and employers.

## Historical Context and Evolution

### Origins of FICA
The Federal [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) Contributions Act was enacted in 1935 as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's [New Deal](../n/new_deal.md). The [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) program initially offered retirement benefits, and over time, it expanded to include disability and survivors' benefits.

### Amendments and Changes
The Medicare program was added to FICA in 1965. Various amendments have adjusted the tax rates, [income](../i/income.md) caps, and benefit structures over the years. For example, the 1983 [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) Amendments gradually increased the retirement age and adjusted the tax rates to address funding concerns.

## Compliance and Reporting

### Employer Responsibilities
Employers must accurately withhold FICA [taxes](../t/taxes.md) from employees' wages, match the employee contributions, and remit the total to the Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Service (IRS). They must also report FICA [taxes](../t/taxes.md) on Form 941 (Employer's Quarterly Federal [Tax Return](../t/tax_return.md)) and provide employees with Form W-2 (Wage and Tax Statement) reflecting the FICA deductions.

### Employee Awareness
Employees should be aware of the FICA deductions on their paychecks and understand how these [taxes](../t/taxes.md) contribute to their future [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) and Medicare benefits. Reviewing Form W-2 and pay stubs helps ensure accurate [withholding](../w/withholding.md).

### Self-employed Reporting
Self-employed individuals report their [self-employment](../s/self-employment.md) tax using Schedule SE (Form 1040) and can calculate their [deduction](../d/deduction.md) for the employer-equivalent portion of the tax on Form 1040.

## Conclusion

The Federal [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) Contributions Act (FICA) plays a foundational role in funding [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) and Medicare, two of the most crucial social [welfare](../w/welfare.md) programs in the United States. Understanding FICA is vital for both employees and employers, as it directly affects [income](../i/income.md), [payroll](../p/payroll.md) processing, and long-term benefits. Through the collaboration between workers, businesses, and the government, FICA ensures that essential support systems remain in place for current and future generations, contributing to economic stability and social [equity](../e/equity.md).

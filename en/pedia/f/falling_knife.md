# Falling Knife

In the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), the term "Falling Knife" refers to a sharp and rapid decline in the price of a stock or other [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md). The metaphor of a "falling knife" vividly illustrates the inherent danger of attempting to catch such an instrument while it is still in the process of a steep downfall. The primary implication is that trying to buy into a falling [market](../m/market.md) too early can lead to significant financial losses, much like attempting to catch a knife mid-air and getting injured in the process.

## Understanding the Falling Knife

A falling knife scenario typically occurs when a stock that had been trading at relatively high levels suddenly plummets due to various reasons including underwhelming [earnings](../e/earnings.md) reports, negative news about the company, broader [market](../m/market.md) sell-offs, or macroeconomic factors. Analysts and investors often use this term to warn against making impulsive buy decisions during such sharp declines, as the stock's price could continue to fall.

### Characteristics of a Falling Knife

1. **Sharp Decline**: The primary trait is a steep and rapid deterioration in the stock's price, making it difficult to predict the bottom.
2. **High [Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: Increased [volatility](../v/volatility.md) is common, with larger than average price swings in short periods.
3. **Negative Sentiment**: There is usually prevailing negative sentiment in the [market](../m/market.md) regarding the stock or the broader sector it belongs to.
4. **Large [Volume](../v/volume.md)**: Often, there is a significant increase in trading [volume](../v/volume.md), indicating panic selling.

## Causes of a Falling Knife

Several factors can trigger the falling knife phenomenon:

1. **[Earnings](../e/earnings.md) Disappointment**: Companies missing [earnings](../e/earnings.md) expectations can trigger a sell-off.
2. **Bad News**: Negative company-specific news, such as legal troubles or executive scandals.
3. **[Market](../m/market.md) Corrections**: Broader [market](../m/market.md) downturns can cause falling knives across various sectors.
4. **Economic Factors**: Macro-economic factors like [inflation](../i/inflation.md), [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) hikes, or geopolitical tensions.

## Risks Involved

Attempting to "catch the falling knife" involves significant [risk](../r/risk.md). Some of the primary risks include:

1. **Continued Decline**: The stock price may continue to drop well beyond initial estimates.
2. **Short-term Losses**: Short-term traders can incur substantial losses in a matter of days or even minutes.
3. **Mistimed Entry**: Entering too early without seeing a solid base can lead to immediate and severe drawdowns.
4. **Psychological Impact**: [Investing](../i/investing.md) in a rapidly declining stock can be emotionally taxing and may lead to poor decisions driven by panic or despair.

## Examples of Falling Knife Scenarios

### 2015 Valeant Pharmaceuticals

Valeant Pharmaceuticals fell precipitously from a high of over $260 per share in August 2015 to less than $18 per share by June 2016. The decline was triggered by charges of [accounting](../a/accounting.md) [fraud](../f/fraud.md) and questionable [business](../b/business.md) practices. Investors who attempted to buy on the way down were faced with severe losses.

### 2008 Financial Crisis

Many financial [stocks](../s/stock.md) were falling knives during the 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md). [Lehman Brothers](../l/lehman_brothers.md), for example, saw its stock price fall sharply before the company's ultimate [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md). Investors who tried to buy into these declining [stocks](../s/stock.md) often faced wiped-out [capital](../c/capital.md) as the companies continued to deteriorate.

## Strategies to Approach a Falling Knife

While the general advice is to avoid catching a falling knife, certain strategies can help manage the [risk](../r/risk.md) for those willing to bet on a [turnaround](../t/turnaround.md):

1. **Wait for Stabilization**: Wait for signs of price stabilization and some upward [momentum](../m/momentum.md) before entering a position.
2. **Limit Orders**: Use limit orders to control the entry price and avoid overpaying during a volatile decline.
3. **Diverse Entry Points**: Use dollar-cost averaging to spread out the purchase over time, minimizing the impact of a single poor entry.
4. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Employ strict [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md) to cap potential losses and protect the investment.

## Technical Indicators in Identifying Falling Knives

[Technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) can aid in identifying falling knife scenarios and determining safer entry points. Some commonly used indicators include:

### Moving Averages

Simple moving averages (SMA) and exponential moving averages (EMA) can help determine overall [market](../m/market.md) direction and potential entry points.

- **200-day SMA**: Crossing below this long-term average can indicate a severe downturn.

### Relative Strength Index (RSI)

The RSI measures the magnitude of recent price changes. An RSI below 30 is typically considered [oversold](../o/oversold.md), suggesting a potential rebound, although it can remain in the [oversold](../o/oversold.md) territory during extended declines.

### Bollinger Bands

[Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_band.md) consist of a middle band (usually an SMA) and two outer bands representing standard deviations. A stock trading below the lower band is often considered [oversold](../o/oversold.md), but it can also signify a falling knife if the decline remains unchecked.

## Fundamental Analysis in Falling Knives

While [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) is often used to identify entry points, [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md) provides insight into whether the company is fundamentally sound or if the drop is warranted due to serious [underlying](../u/underlying.md) issues.

### Earnings Reports

Thoroughly analyze recent [earnings](../e/earnings.md) reports and future [guidance](../g/guidance.md) to gauge the company's health and prospects.

### Balance Sheet Strength

Assess [liquidity ratios](../l/liquidity_ratios.md), [debt](../d/debt.md) levels, and [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) to determine if the company can withstand the downturn or if [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) is a potential [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Sector Health

Evaluate the overall health and trends within the sector. Sometimes, broader sector issues can drag down a fundamentally strong company.

## Famous Investment Opinions on Falling Knives

Notable investors have weighed in on the pitfalls and opportunities of falling knives.

### Warren Buffett

Warren Buffett generally advises against trying to catch falling knives. His investment philosophy is to buy strong, fundamentally sound companies at a fair price and [hold](../h/hold.md) them long-term rather than trying to time [market](../m/market.md) bottoms.

### Peter Lynch

Peter Lynch emphasized understanding the company and its fundamentals. He advised against buying [stocks](../s/stock.md) solely based on a steep price drop, advocating instead for well-researched, fundamentally strong investments.

## Conclusion

The term "falling knife" serves as a vivid warning in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). It encapsulates the hazards of buying into a rapidly declining stock without thorough research and prudent [risk management](../r/risk_management.md). While some investors may [profit](../p/profit.md) from well-timed entries at or near the bottom, the inherent risks make catching a falling knife a treacherous endeavor best approached with caution and sound strategy.

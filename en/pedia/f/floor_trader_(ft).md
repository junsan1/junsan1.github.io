# Floor Trader (FT)

A **Floor [Trader](../t/trader.md) (FT)**, sometimes referred to as a Floor [Broker](../b/broker.md), is an individual who trades securities on the floor of an [exchange](../e/exchange.md) for their own account. Floor traders are typically members of stock or commodities exchanges and are often seen in the trading pits, a physical location where trading activities are conducted. They play a critical role in the [market](../m/market.md), providing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and reducing [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md) for other [market](../m/market.md) participants through their trading activities.

## Functions and Roles

Floor traders can be seen as the lifeblood of traditional [open](../o/open.md)-outcry [exchange](../e/exchange.md) systems. They perform several functions:

1. **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) Providers:** Floor traders facilitate trading by providing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md). By making markets, they ensure that there's always a counter-party willing to [trade](../t/trade.md), thereby reducing the [bid](../b/bid.md)-ask [spreads](../s/spreads.md) - the difference between the buying and selling prices.

2. **[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md):** They engage in [arbitrage opportunities](../a/arbitrage_opportunities.md) between different exchanges or different contracts. This involves buying and selling the same [security](../s/security.md) in different markets to take advantage of price discrepancies.

3. **[Market](../m/market.md) Information:** Due to their direct involvement on the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) floor, they have access to real-time [market](../m/market.md) information, which can influence their [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

4. **[Execution](../e/execution.md) of Large Orders:** They help in executing large institutional orders that might be difficult to fulfill electronically due to their size or complexity.

## Trading Strategies

Floor traders use a variety of strategies to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on [market](../m/market.md) movements:

1. **[Scalping](../s/scalping.md):** This involves making numerous trades over a short period to capture small price differences. The objective is to accumulate small profits that add up over time.

2. **[Market](../m/market.md) Making:** They place buy and sell orders simultaneously to [profit](../p/profit.md) from the spread. The goal is to earn the difference between the buying and selling price while providing [market](../m/market.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).

3. **[Trend Following](../t/trend_following.md):** Floor traders might follow and [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on [market](../m/market.md) trends. They buy securities that are trending upwards and sell those that are trending downwards.

4. **[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md):** This strategy involves exploiting price discrepancies between different markets or securities. The floor [trader](../t/trader.md) [will](../w/will.md) buy low in one [market](../m/market.md) and sell high in another.

## Changes in Technology and Their Impact

With the advent of electronic trading, the role and prevalence of floor traders have diminished significantly. Electronic trading platforms, such as the New York Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md)'s (NYSE) Arca and [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) are examples where trading has shifted from physical floors to online systems.

### Accessibility and Speed

- New technologies have allowed for instant [execution](../e/execution.md) of trades, reducing the need for human intermediaries. Algorithms can now match orders with greater [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) than manual floor trading.

### Cost Reduction 

- Electronic trading is generally more cost-effective. Traditional floor trading involved several intermediaries, each taking a cut, whereas electronic platforms reduce these overheads significantly.

### Transparency and Regulation

- Electronic systems [offer](../o/offer.md) greater [transparency](../t/transparency.md), with real-time data and audit trails. This has made it easier for regulatory bodies to monitor trading activities and ensure compliance with [market](../m/market.md) rules.

### The Shift to High-Frequency Trading (HFT)

High-frequency trading (HFT) firms use sophisticated algorithms to execute large volumes of trades at extremely high speeds. These firms have largely taken over the role of traditional floor traders in providing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).

- **Speed:** HFT uses complex algorithms and high-speed data networks to execute trades in fractions of a second.
- **Data:** They analyze vast amounts of [market](../m/market.md) data to identify trading opportunities that are invisible to human traders.

### Future of Floor Trading

Despite the decline in their numbers, floor traders have not been entirely phased out. Several exchanges still maintain physical trading floors, notably the NYSE and the Chicago Mercantile [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (CME). These floors continue to serve important roles in [price discovery](../p/price_discovery.md) and maintaining [market](../m/market.md) operations during times of significant [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

In summary, floor traders have historically been vital components of [market](../m/market.md) operations, providing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and facilitating large trades. While their role has evolved with technological advancements, the foundational principles of [market](../m/market.md) making and [liquidity provision](../l/liquidity_provision.md) continue to underlie modern trading practices.

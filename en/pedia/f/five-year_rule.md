# Five-Year Rule

## Definition
The **Five-Year Rule** refers to a set of regulations related to certain types of [tax-advantaged](../t/tax-advantaged.md) accounts and investments, primarily concerning the [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of [earnings](../e/earnings.md) from Roth IRAs and the [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) of funds from 529 college savings plans. These rules are designed to determine the tax treatment of distributions and to encourage long-term savings.

## Applications of the Five-Year Rule
### 1. Roth IRA (Individual Retirement Account)
The Five-Year Rule applies to Roth IRAs in two key contexts: contributions and conversions.

#### Contributions
- **Initial Contribution Rule**: To qualify for [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md) [earnings](../e/earnings.md) on distributions, the [Roth IRA](../r/roth_ira.md) must be [open](../o/open.md) for at least five years from the tax year of the first contribution. This period begins on January 1 of the year for which the first contribution was made.
- **Qualified Distributions**: To be considered a [qualified distribution](../q/qualified_distribution.md) (and thus [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md)), the [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) must occur after a five-year period and the account holder must meet one of the following conditions:
  - Be at least 59Â½ years old
  - Be disabled
  - Be using the funds for a first-time [home](../h/home.md) purchase (up to a $10,000 lifetime limit)
  - Be deceased (beneficiaries can withdraw without penalty)

#### Conversions
- **Conversion Rule**: If funds are converted from a [traditional IRA](../t/traditional_ira.md) to a [Roth IRA](../r/roth_ira.md), each conversion has its own five-year period. Withdrawals of converted amounts within five years of the conversion may be subject to a 10% early [withdrawal penalty](../w/withdrawal_penalty.md) unless an exception applies.

### 2. 529 College Savings Plans
The Five-Year Rule also applies to [529 plans](../1/529_plan.md) in a different context.

- **Superfunding**: 529 plan contributions are subject to [gift tax](../g/gift_tax.md) rules. The IRS allows a special [provision](../p/provision.md) for [529 plans](../1/529_plan.md) known as "superfunding," where contributors can make a lump-sum contribution of up to five times the annual [gift tax](../g/gift_tax.md) exclusion amount ($17,000 per [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md) in 2023, resulting in a maximum of $85,000 or $170,000 for married couples) without incurring gift [taxes](../t/taxes.md), provided no additional gifts are made to the same [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md) for five years.
- **[Tax-Free](../t/tax_free.md) Distributions**: [Earnings](../e/earnings.md) from a 529 plan can be withdrawn [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md) if used for qualified educational expenses. The Five-Year Rule ensures that substantial contributions are spread over five years for tax purposes.

## Importance and Benefits
1. **[Tax Planning](../t/tax_planning.md)**: Understanding the Five-Year Rule helps individuals plan their contributions and withdrawals to maximize tax benefits and avoid penalties.
2. **Encourages Long-Term Savings**: The rule incentivizes long-term savings in retirement and education accounts, aligning with the intended use of these [tax-advantaged](../t/tax-advantaged.md) vehicles.
3. **[Gift Tax](../g/gift_tax.md) Management**: The rule provides a way to make significant contributions to a 529 plan while managing [gift tax](../g/gift_tax.md) implications effectively.

## Example Scenarios
### Roth IRA
- **Initial Contribution**: Jane makes her first [Roth IRA](../r/roth_ira.md) contribution in 2024. The Five-Year Rule means that her [Roth IRA](../r/roth_ira.md) must be [open](../o/open.md) until at least January 1, 2029, for any [earnings](../e/earnings.md) to be [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md) if she makes a [qualified distribution](../q/qualified_distribution.md).
- **Conversion**: John converts $50,000 from his [traditional IRA](../t/traditional_ira.md) to a [Roth IRA](../r/roth_ira.md) in 2025. The converted amount must remain in the [Roth IRA](../r/roth_ira.md) until 2030 to avoid the 10% early [withdrawal penalty](../w/withdrawal_penalty.md) unless he qualifies for an exception.

### 529 Plan
- **Superfunding**: In 2023, Mike and Emily contribute $170,000 to their child's 529 plan, taking advantage of the five-year [gift tax](../g/gift_tax.md) averaging. They cannot make additional contributions for this child until 2028 without exceeding the annual [gift tax](../g/gift_tax.md) exclusion.

## Conclusion
The Five-Year Rule is a critical consideration in managing Roth IRAs and 529 college savings plans, ensuring that individuals can optimize their tax benefits and adhere to regulatory requirements. Understanding and applying this rule effectively can lead to significant tax savings and help achieve long-term financial goals.

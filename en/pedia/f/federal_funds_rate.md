# Federal Funds Rate

The [Federal Funds](../f/federal_funds.md) Rate is one of the most critical [interest](../i/interest.md) rates within the U.S. [economy](../e/economy.md). It is the rate at which [depository](../d/depository.md) institutions, including banks and [credit](../c/credit.md) unions, lend reserve balances to other [depository](../d/depository.md) institutions overnight on an uncollateralized [basis](../b/basis.md). This rate is a foundational element in U.S. [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) and has significant influence over other [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, including those for mortgages, savings, and loans.

## Definition

### What is the Federal Funds Rate?

The [Federal Funds](../f/federal_funds.md) Rate is the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) at which banks and other [depository](../d/depository.md) institutions lend balances held at the Federal Reserve to other [depository](../d/depository.md) institutions overnight. These balances are used to meet [reserve requirements](../r/reserve_requirements.md), as mandated by the Federal Reserve.

### How is the Federal Funds Rate Determined?

The [Federal Funds](../f/federal_funds.md) Rate is determined by the Federal [Open Market](../o/open_market.md) Committee (FOMC) of the Federal Reserve. During its regular meetings, the FOMC sets a target [range](../r/range.md) for the [Federal Funds](../f/federal_funds.md) Rate. The actual rate tends to gravitate toward this target through [open market operations](../o/open_market_operations.md) conducted by the Federal Reserveâ€™s [trading desk](../t/trading_desk.md).

## Importance of the Federal Funds Rate

### Economic Influence

The [Federal Funds](../f/federal_funds.md) Rate has far-reaching implications for the American [economy](../e/economy.md). By adjusting this rate, the Federal Reserve can influence [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md), [inflation](../i/inflation.md), and employment:

- **[Economic Growth](../e/economic_growth.md):** Lowering the [Federal Funds](../f/federal_funds.md) Rate can stimulate the [economy](../e/economy.md) by making borrowing cheaper, which encourages spending and investment.
- **[Inflation](../i/inflation.md) Control:** Conversely, raising the rate can help to control [inflation](../i/inflation.md) by making borrowing more expensive, thus slowing down consumption and investment.
- **Employment:** The rate impacts job creation and employment levels, as businesses are more likely to hire when borrowing costs are low.

### Financial Markets

The [Federal Funds](../f/federal_funds.md) Rate is also crucial in setting the tone for [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). A lower rate generally leads to higher [asset](../a/asset.md) prices, including [stocks](../s/stock.md) and [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), as borrowing costs decrease. Conversely, a higher rate tends to depress [asset](../a/asset.md) prices as borrowing costs increase. 

## Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)

### Composition and Role

The FOMC is composed of 12 members: seven members of the [Board of Governors](../b/board_of_governors.md) of the Federal Reserve System, the president of the [Federal Reserve Bank](../f/federal_reserve_bank.md) of New York, and four of the remaining eleven Reserve [Bank](../b/bank.md) presidents, who serve one-year terms on a rotating [basis](../b/basis.md).

The FOMC meets eight times a year to discuss [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) and to set the target for the [Federal Funds](../f/federal_funds.md) Rate. The committee uses various [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md) to guide its decisions, including employment figures, GDP growth, and [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rates.

### Policy Tools

The FOMC uses several tools to achieve its target for the [Federal Funds](../f/federal_funds.md) Rate:

- **[Open Market Operations](../o/open_market_operations.md) (OMOs):** The primary tool, involving the buying and selling of government securities in the [open market](../o/open_market.md) to influence the [supply](../s/supply.md) of [money](../m/money.md).
- **[Discount Rate](../d/discount_rate.md):** The [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) charged to commercial banks for borrowing short-term funds directly from Federal Reserve Banks.
- **[Reserve Requirements](../r/reserve_requirements.md):** These are regulations concerning the amount of funds that a [bank](../b/bank.md) must [hold](../h/hold.md) in reserve against specified [deposit](../d/deposit.md) liabilities. Changes in [reserve requirements](../r/reserve_requirements.md) can directly affect the [Federal Funds](../f/federal_funds.md) Rate.

## Mechanisms of Influence

### Open Market Operations

The Federal Reserve's [open market operations](../o/open_market_operations.md) involve buying and selling government securities to regulate the [supply](../s/supply.md) of [money](../m/money.md). For example, to lower the [Federal Funds](../f/federal_funds.md) Rate, the Fed buys government securities, adding to the reserves of the banking system, which increases the amount of funds available for banks to lend, pushing the rate down.

Conversely, to increase the rate, the Fed sells government securities, removing funds from the banking system, which decreases the amount banks have available to lend, pushing the rate up.

### Economic Indicators and Data

The FOMC relies on a [range](../r/range.md) of economic data to guide their decisions regarding the [Federal Funds](../f/federal_funds.md) Rate. Some key indicators include:

- **Gross Domestic Product (GDP):** Measures the total economic output and provides a broad view of economic health.
- **[Inflation](../i/inflation.md) Rates:** Indicated by measures such as the Consumer Price [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (CPI) and Producer Price [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (PPI).
- **Employment Data:** [Unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) rates and job creation figures are critical indicators of economic activity and [labor market](../l/labor_market.md) health.

## Effects of Changes in the Federal Funds Rate

### On Consumers

Changes in the [Federal Funds](../f/federal_funds.md) Rate have direct and indirect effects on consumers. An increase in the rate typically leads to higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates on loans and [credit](../c/credit.md) cards, making borrowing more expensive and potentially reducing consumer spending. On the other hand, a decrease in the rate usually results in lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates for consumers, encouraging borrowing and spending.

### On Businesses

For businesses, changes in the [Federal Funds](../f/federal_funds.md) Rate can affect borrowing costs and investment decisions. Higher rates increase the cost of [financing](../f/financing.md) for [capital](../c/capital.md) investments and may slow down [business](../b/business.md) [expansion](../e/expansion.md) plans. Lower rates make borrowing cheaper, which can bolster [business](../b/business.md) investment and growth. 

### On the Stock Market

Stock prices can be highly sensitive to changes in the [Federal Funds](../f/federal_funds.md) Rate. Lowering the rate can lead to higher stock prices as investors seek higher returns in equities due to lower returns on fixed-[income](../i/income.md) investments. Conversely, raising the rate can lead to lower stock prices as the higher returns on safe investments become more attractive.

## Historical Perspective

### Historical Rates

Over the years, the [Federal Funds](../f/federal_funds.md) Rate has seen various levels, generally reflecting the [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md) of the time:

- **1970s-1980s:** The rate was primarily used to combat high [inflation](../i/inflation.md), often set at double-digit levels.
- **1990s-2000s:** The rate was lowered significantly to stimulate [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) following the dot-com bubble and the 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md).
- **2010s:** Rates were kept near zero for an extended period to support a slow recovery, with gradual increases starting in 2015.
- **2020s:** In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the rate was again lowered to near zero to provide economic support.

### Economic Events and Rate Changes

Major economic events often necessitate significant adjustments to the [Federal Funds](../f/federal_funds.md) Rate:

- **2008 [Financial Crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md):** The rate was lowered dramatically to combat the severe economic downturn, with policies such as [quantitative easing](../q/quantitative_easing.md) introduced to further support the [economy](../e/economy.md).
- **COVID-19 Pandemic:** The rate was swiftly reduced to near-zero levels in 2020 to counteract the [economic shock](../e/economic_shock.md) and support [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and consumer and [business](../b/business.md) confidence.

## Forward Guidance and Market Expectations

### Forward Guidance

Forward [guidance](../g/guidance.md) is a tool used by the Federal Reserve to provide information about its future policy intentions. By communicating the likely future path of the [Federal Funds](../f/federal_funds.md) Rate, the Fed aims to influence economic expectations and behavior.

### Market Reactions

[Financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) closely watch the Federal Reserve's statements and adjust their expectations accordingly. Unexpected changes in the [Federal Funds](../f/federal_funds.md) Rate or changes in forward [guidance](../g/guidance.md) can have significant impacts on [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) and [asset](../a/asset.md) prices.

## Conclusion

The [Federal Funds](../f/federal_funds.md) Rate is a pivotal element of U.S. [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md), influencing various aspects of the [economy](../e/economy.md), from consumer spending to [business](../b/business.md) investment and [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). Understanding its mechanisms, impacts, and historical context is crucial for anyone interested in [economics](../e/economics.md), [finance](../f/finance.md), or [investing](../i/investing.md).

By carefully managing the [Federal Funds](../f/federal_funds.md) Rate, the Federal Reserve aims to achieve its dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and ensuring price stability, thereby maintaining a stable economic environment conducive to sustainable growth.

# Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG)

Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) refer to products that are sold quickly and at relatively low cost. These products are also known as Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG). They typically feature high consumer demand and undergo rapid turnover compared to other product types. FMCG include a wide array of items such as food, beverages, cleaning products, personal hygiene products, and over-the-counter drugs. Because of their high turnover and broad reach, FMCG products play a significant role in the economy.

## Characteristics of FMCGs

1. **High Turnover Rate**: FMCG products are purchased frequently and used quickly. They have a short shelf life due to high consumer demand.

2. **Low Cost**: Most FMCG products are sold at a lower price point, allowing for quick sale and easy replacement.

3. **Widespread Distribution**: FMCG products are usually available in various retail locations, from supermarkets to convenience stores.

4. **Bulk Production**: These goods are often produced in large quantities to meet the high demand, employing economies of scale to keep costs low.

5. **Short Shelf Life**: Many FMCG items are perishable and need to be consumed within a short period (e.g., food items). Even non-perishable items like toiletries are quickly replaced by consumers, contributing to their high turnover rate.

## Categories of FMCG

1. **Food and Beverages**: Includes snacks, dairy products, frozen foods, baked goods, and non-alcoholic drinks like soda and juice.
   
2. **Personal Care Products**: Items like toothpaste, shampoo, cosmetics, and deodorants fall under this category.
  
3. **Household Care Products**: Items used for home maintenance, such as detergents, fabric softeners, and cleaning agents.

4. **Over-the-Counter Medicines**: Includes medications that can be purchased without a prescription, such as pain relievers, cold medicines, and antiseptics.

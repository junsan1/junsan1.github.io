# Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG)

Fast-Moving [Consumer Goods](../c/consumer_goods.md) (FMCG) refer to products that are sold quickly and at relatively low cost. These products are also known as Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG). They typically feature high consumer [demand](../d/demand.md) and undergo rapid [turnover](../t/turnover.md) compared to other product types. FMCG include a wide array of items such as food, beverages, cleaning products, personal hygiene products, and over-the-counter drugs. Because of their high [turnover](../t/turnover.md) and broad reach, FMCG products play a significant role in the [economy](../e/economy.md).

## Characteristics of FMCGs

1. **High [Turnover](../t/turnover.md) Rate**: FMCG products are purchased frequently and used quickly. They have a short shelf life due to high consumer [demand](../d/demand.md).

2. **Low Cost**: Most FMCG products are sold at a lower price point, allowing for quick [sale](../s/sale.md) and easy replacement.

3. **Widespread [Distribution](../d/distribution.md)**: FMCG products are usually available in various retail locations, from supermarkets to convenience stores.

4. **Bulk Production**: These goods are often produced in large quantities to meet the high [demand](../d/demand.md), employing [economies of scale](../e/economies_of_scale.md) to keep costs low.

5. **Short Shelf Life**: Many FMCG items are perishable and need to be consumed within a short period (e.g., food items). Even non-perishable items like toiletries are quickly replaced by consumers, contributing to their high [turnover](../t/turnover.md) rate.

## Categories of FMCG

1. **Food and Beverages**: Includes snacks, dairy products, frozen foods, baked goods, and non-alcoholic drinks like soda and juice.
   
2. **Personal Care Products**: Items like toothpaste, shampoo, cosmetics, and deodorants fall under this category.

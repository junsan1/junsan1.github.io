# FICO Score

The FICO Score, developed by the Fair Isaac [Corporation](../c/corporation.md), is a widely used [credit](../c/credit.md) scoring system that helps lenders evaluate the [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) of potential borrowers. It plays a crucial role in the financial decision-making process and has become an [industry](../i/industry.md) standard in the United States and several other countries. This detailed guide [will](../w/will.md) cover various aspects of the FICO Score, including its history, calculation methodology, factors affecting it, and its significance in the financial [industry](../i/industry.md).

## History of FICO Score

The [genesis](../g/genesis.md) of the FICO Score dates back to 1956 when engineers William R. "Bill" Fair and Earl J. Isaac founded Fair, Isaac and Company (now Fair Isaac [Corporation](../c/corporation.md), or FICO). Their primary aim was to create a data-driven approach to [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) assessment, leveraging statistical models to evaluate a borrower's likelihood of repaying their debts. By the late 1980s, FICO Scores had become a mainstream tool used by lenders to assess [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md).

## Calculation Methodology

### Overview

FICO Scores are calculated based on the information in an individual's [credit report](../c/credit_report.md). The Fair Isaac [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) employs [proprietary algorithms](../p/proprietary_algorithms.md) that analyze a variety of [credit](../c/credit.md) data points, which are [weighted](../w/weighted.md) to produce a three-digit score ranging from 300 to 850. The higher the score, the lower the perceived [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md).

### Factors Influencing FICO Score

The FICO Score is determined by five [principal components](../p/principal_components_in_trading.md), each with a specific weight:

1. **[Payment](../p/payment.md) History (35%)**
   - This component examines an individual's track record of repaying past [credit](../c/credit.md) accounts. Factors such as late payments, defaults, and information on public records like bankruptcies significantly impact this category.

2. **Amounts Owed (30%)**
   - This evaluates the total amount of outstanding [debt](../d/debt.md) and compares it to the available [credit](../c/credit.md) limits. High [credit](../c/credit.md) utilization rates typically lower the score.

3. **Length of [Credit](../c/credit.md) History (15%)**
   - A longer [credit](../c/credit.md) history generally results in a higher score, as it provides more data points for the FICO algorithm to analyze. This component considers the age of the oldest account, the age of the newest account, and the average age of all accounts.

4. **New [Credit](../c/credit.md) (10%)**
   - This [factor](../f/factor.md) assesses the number of recently opened accounts and recent [credit](../c/credit.md) inquiries. Opening several new accounts in a short period may negatively impact the score.

5. **[Credit](../c/credit.md) Mix (10%)**
   - A well-rounded [credit](../c/credit.md) portfolio, including a blend of [credit](../c/credit.md) types such as [credit](../c/credit.md) cards, [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) loans, and auto loans, can positively influence the score.

### Score Ranges

FICO Scores can be broadly categorized into the following ranges:

- **Poor (300-579)**: Individuals with scores in this [range](../r/range.md) are considered high-[risk](../r/risk.md) borrowers.
- **Fair (580-669)**: These scores indicate moderate [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md).
- **Good (670-739)**: Borrowers with scores in this [range](../r/range.md) are considered low to moderate [risk](../r/risk.md).
- **Very Good (740-799)**: Scores in this [range](../r/range.md) signify low [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md).
- **Excellent (800-850)**: Individuals in this [range](../r/range.md) have a very low [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md).

## Importance in Financial Industry

### Lenders

For lenders, FICO Scores are invaluable tools for making informed [credit](../c/credit.md) decisions. They help in:

- **Assessing [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: FICO Scores provide a quick and reliable way to gauge the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a [loan](../l/loan.md).
- **Determining Terms**: [Interest](../i/interest.md) rates, [loan](../l/loan.md) amounts, and other [credit](../c/credit.md) terms are often influenced by the applicant's FICO Score.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: FICO Scores help financial institutions comply with [underwriting standards](../u/underwriting_standards.md) and regulatory requirements.

### Consumers

For consumers, understanding and maintaining a good FICO Score is essential for:

- **Access to [Credit](../c/credit.md)**: A higher FICO Score increases the likelihood of [loan](../l/loan.md) approval.
- **Favorable Terms**: Consumers with high scores are more likely to secure loans with lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, reducing the cost of borrowing.
- **[Insurance](../i/insurance.md) Rates**: In some cases, a good FICO Score can result in lower [insurance](../i/insurance.md) premiums.

### Real Estate

In the context of [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), FICO Scores are crucial for [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) qualification. They determine the types of [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) products consumers are eligible for, as well as the [interest](../i/interest.md) rates they [will](../w/will.md) be offered. Borrowers with higher scores typically secure better [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) terms, affecting their [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) and the total cost of homeownership.

### Employment

In some industries, employers may review [credit](../c/credit.md) reports and FICO Scores as part of the hiring process, especially for positions that require financial responsibility. A good [credit score](../c/credit_score.md) can be a positive [factor](../f/factor.md) in the job application process.

## Credit Reporting Agencies

FICO Scores are calculated using data from three major [credit](../c/credit.md) reporting agencies (CRAs) in the United States:

- **Equifax**: [Equifax Website](https://www.equifax.com)
- **Experian**: [Experian Website](https://www.experian.com)
- **TransUnion**: [TransUnion Website](https://www.transunion.com)

These agencies collect and maintain information on consumers' [credit](../c/credit.md) behaviors, which is then used to generate FICO Scores. Each CRA may have slightly different data, leading to variations in the FICO Scores calculated by each agency.

## Variants of FICO Score

The Fair Isaac [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) has developed several versions of the FICO Score to cater to different needs:

### Base FICO Scores

These are the most commonly used scores across various lenders and are available in different versions (e.g., FICO Score 8, FICO Score 9).

### Industry-Specific FICO Scores

These scores are tailored for specific types of lending, such as:

- **FICO Auto Scores**: Used in auto lending.
- **FICO Bankcard Scores**: Used for [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) lending.
- **FICO [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) Scores**: Used in [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) lending.

### UltraFICO and FICO XD

- **UltraFICO Score**: This score is designed to expand [credit](../c/credit.md) access by incorporating banking activity into the scoring process. It is useful for individuals with limited [credit](../c/credit.md) history.
- **FICO XD Score**: Created to assess [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) for consumers with insufficient [credit](../c/credit.md) history, using [alternative data](../a/alternative_data.md) sources.

## How to Improve Your FICO Score

Improving a FICO Score involves several steps:

1. **Timely Payments**: Ensuring that all [credit](../c/credit.md) accounts are paid on time is crucial.
2. **Reduce [Debt](../d/debt.md)**: Lowering the total amount of [debt](../d/debt.md) can significantly improve the score.
3. **Avoid New [Credit](../c/credit.md)**: Limiting the number of new [credit](../c/credit.md) applications can help maintain a stable score.
4. **Monitor [Credit](../c/credit.md) Reports**: Regularly checking [credit](../c/credit.md) reports for inaccuracies can help in maintaining an accurate score. Consumers are entitled to one free [credit report](../c/credit_report.md) per year from each of the three major CRAs through AnnualCreditReport.com.

## Conclusion

The FICO Score remains a cornerstone of [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) assessment, influencing a wide [range](../r/range.md) of financial decisions for both lenders and consumers. Its comprehensive methodology, factoring in various aspects of an individual's [credit](../c/credit.md) behavior, provides a nuanced assessment of [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md). By understanding how FICO Scores are calculated and the factors influencing them, consumers can take proactive steps to improve their [credit](../c/credit.md) profiles, thereby enhancing their access to [credit](../c/credit.md) and favorable financial terms. With the continuous evolution of [credit](../c/credit.md) scoring models, such as UltraFICO and FICO XD, the landscape of [credit](../c/credit.md) evaluation promises to become more inclusive and reflective of an individual's overall [financial health](../f/financial_health.md).

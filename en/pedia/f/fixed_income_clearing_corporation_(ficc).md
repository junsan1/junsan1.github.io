# Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC)

The [Fixed Income](../f/fixed_income.md) [Clearing](../c/clearing.md) [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) (FICC) is a key component of the financial [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) in the United States, playing a crucial role in the [clearing and settlement](../c/clearing_and_settlement.md) process for [fixed income securities](../f/fixed_income_securities.md). As a subsidiary of the [Depository](../d/depository.md) [Trust](../t/trust.md) & [Clearing](../c/clearing.md) [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) (DTCC), FICC handles the clearance, settlement, and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) of transactions in the [fixed income](../f/fixed_income.md) [market](../m/market.md), which includes government securities, [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-backed securities, and other [debt](../d/debt.md) instruments.

## Overview

FICC was created in 2003 through the [merger](../m/merger.md) of two units of the DTCC: the Government Securities [Clearing](../c/clearing.md) [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) (GSCC) and the [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-Backed Securities [Clearing](../c/clearing.md) [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) (MBSCC). This [consolidation](../c/consolidation.md) aimed to streamline operations and provide a single platform to clear and settle [fixed income](../f/fixed_income.md) transactions. FICC operates two main divisions: the Government Securities Division (GSD) and the [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-Backed Securities Division (MBSD), each catering to specific segments of the [fixed income](../f/fixed_income.md) [market](../m/market.md).

## Functions and Services

### Clearing and Settlement
FICC provides centralized [clearing and settlement](../c/clearing_and_settlement.md) services, which involve the confirmation, [novation](../n/novation_in_trading.md), and [netting](../n/netting.md) of transactions. By acting as the central [counterparty](../c/counterparty.md) (CCP), FICC reduces [counterparty risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md) and ensures the efficient [execution](../e/execution.md) of transactions. The process involves [trade](../t/trade.md) comparison, [trade](../t/trade.md) capture, and the subsequent issuance of settlement instructions to the participants.

### Risk Management
To mitigate the [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with trading [fixed income securities](../f/fixed_income_securities.md), FICC employs various [risk management techniques](../r/risk_management_techniques.md). These include daily mark-to-[market](../m/market.md) calculations, [margin](../m/margin.md) requirements, and the maintenance of a [clearing](../c/clearing.md) [fund](../f/fund.md). FICC also conducts regular stress tests to assess the potential impact of [market](../m/market.md) fluctuations on its participants and the system as a whole.

### Central Counterparty Services
As a CCP, FICC stands between the buyer and seller of a [transaction](../t/transaction.md), effectively guaranteeing the completion of the [trade](../t/trade.md) even if one of the parties defaults. This role enhances [market](../m/market.md) stability and confidence among participants, as it ensures the integrity and finality of trades.

### Netting
[Netting](../n/netting.md) is a critical service provided by FICC, which reduces the number of securities and cash exchanges required to settle [multiple](../m/multiple.md) transactions. By [netting](../n/netting.md) trades, FICC minimizes settlement [risk](../r/risk.md) and increases [operational efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md). This process significantly lowers the [volume](../v/volume.md) of settlement [obligations](../o/obligation.md), reducing the [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) needs of [market](../m/market.md) participants.

### Trade Comparison and Matching
FICC provides electronic platforms for the comparison and matching of [trade](../t/trade.md) details submitted by participants. This step is crucial for ensuring the accuracy and validity of transactions before they proceed to the [clearing and settlement](../c/clearing_and_settlement.md) phase. FICC's [trade](../t/trade.md) comparison service helps prevent discrepancies and disputes, streamlining the overall process.

## Divisions of FICC

### Government Securities Division (GSD)
The GSD handles the clearance and settlement of [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) and federal agency securities. This division is vital for maintaining the smooth operation of the government securities [market](../m/market.md), which is a cornerstone of the U.S. [financial system](../f/financial_system.md). The GSD provides services such as repo [netting](../n/netting.md), which allows [market](../m/market.md) participants to [offset](../o/offset.md) their repo and reverse repo trades, reducing the number of settlements and associated risks.

### Mortgage-Backed Securities Division (MBSD)
The MBSD focuses on the clearance and settlement of [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-backed securities (MBS), including those issued by government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) like Fannie Mae, [Freddie Mac](../f/freddie_mac.md), and Ginnie Mae. The MBSD offers similar services to the GSD, including [trade](../t/trade.md) comparison, [netting](../n/netting.md), and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), tailored to the specific needs of the MBS [market](../m/market.md).

## Membership and Participation

FICC's membership includes a diverse [range](../r/range.md) of financial institutions, such as [broker](../b/broker.md)-dealers, banks, [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds, and [asset](../a/asset.md) managers.

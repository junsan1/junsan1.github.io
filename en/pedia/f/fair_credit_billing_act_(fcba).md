# Fair Credit Billing Act (FCBA)

## Introduction
The Fair [Credit](../c/credit.md) Billing Act (FCBA) is a federal law enacted in 1974 as an amendment to the Truth in Lending Act (TILA). The purpose of the FCBA is to protect consumers from unfair billing practices and to provide a mechanism for addressing billing errors on [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) accounts. This law is instrumental in ensuring that consumers have the means to dispute inaccurate or fraudulent charges and to be informed about their rights concerning [credit](../c/credit.md) billing.

## Scope and Coverage

The FCBA applies to "[open](../o/open.md)-end" [credit](../c/credit.md) accounts, which include [credit](../c/credit.md) cards, charge cards, and revolving charge accounts. It does not apply to installment loans or other types of [credit](../c/credit.md) agreements where the amount borrowed is paid off according to a fixed schedule.

## Key Provisions of the FCBA

### Billing Error Resolution

The FCBA provides detailed procedures for consumers and creditors to follow when dealing with billing errors. The types of billing errors covered by the FCBA include:
- Charges for goods and services that were not delivered or accepted.
- Charges for goods and services that were not ordered.
- Incorrect amounts charged.
- Unauthorized charges.
- Failure to reflect payments or other credits properly.
- Computational and clerical errors.
- Statements sent to the wrong address if the consumer had previously informed the [creditor](../c/creditor.md) of a change of address at least 20 days before the [billing cycle](../b/billing_cycle.md) ended.

### Consumer Rights

Under the FCBA, consumers have the following rights:
- To dispute billing errors by writing to the [creditor](../c/creditor.md).
- To withhold [payment](../p/payment.md) on the disputed amount while the error is being investigated.
- To be informed of the results of the investigation.
- To receive clarification from the [creditor](../c/creditor.md) about the disputed amount.

### Creditor Responsibilities

Creditors must:
- Acknowledge the consumer's written dispute within 30 days of receipt.
- Investigate and resolve the dispute within two billing cycles (but not more than 90 days).
- Refrain from taking any legal or collection action while the dispute is being investigated.
- Correct the billing error and inform the consumer if an error is found.
- Provide a written explanation if the billing dispute is not resolved in the consumer’s favor.

### Liability Limitations

The FCBA limits the consumer's [liability](../l/liability.md) for unauthorized charges to $50. However, many [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) companies waive this [fee](../f/fee.md) and [offer](../o/offer.md) zero [liability](../l/liability.md) for fraudulent charges as a service incentive.

## Process for Disputing a Billing Error

### Step 1: Review Your Billing Statement

Consumers should regularly review their billing statements to ensure all charges are accurate. Any suspicious or incorrect charges should be identified immediately.

### Step 2: Send a Written Notice

To dispute a billing error, consumers must send a written notice to the [creditor](../c/creditor.md). This notice must meet specific requirements:
- It must be sent within 60 days after the first billing statement was sent that contained the error.
- It should include the consumer’s name, [account number](../a/account_number.md), a description of the billing error, and the reasons why the consumer believes there is an error.

### Step 3: Creditor Acknowledgment

Within 30 days of receiving the dispute notice, the [creditor](../c/creditor.md) must acknowledge receipt in writing. 

### Step 4: Investigation

The [creditor](../c/creditor.md) must complete the investigation within two billing cycles (but not more than 90 days). During this period, the consumer is not required to pay the disputed amount, and it cannot be subject to [finance charges](../f/finance_charge.md) or reported as [delinquent](../d/delinquent.md).

### Step 5: Resolution

Upon completion of the investigation, the [creditor](../c/creditor.md) must:
- Correct the error if it is confirmed, removing the disputed charge and any associated fees.
- Provide a written explanation if the error is not confirmed, detailing why the [creditor](../c/creditor.md) believes the billing statement was correct.

## Conclusion

The Fair [Credit](../c/credit.md) Billing Act (FCBA) provides vital protections for consumers against unfair billing practices and errors. By outlining a clear process for disputing inaccuracies and limiting consumers' [liability](../l/liability.md) for unauthorized charges, the FCBA helps to ensure that consumers are treated fairly and can [trust](../t/trust.md) the integrity of their [credit](../c/credit.md) billing statements. It is important for consumers to be aware of their rights under the FCBA and to proactively review and manage their [credit](../c/credit.md) accounts to take full advantage of these protections.

# Funded Debt

Funded [debt](../d/debt.md) is a form of [long-term debt](../l/long-term_debt.md), usually appearing on a company's [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md), which refers to any [debt](../d/debt.md) that is scheduled to mature in more than one year. This can include bonds, long-term loans, and other financial instruments that require regular [interest](../i/interest.md) payments and [maturity](../m/maturity.md) dates several years into the future. The term "funded" refers to the fact that the issuing company has "funded" these [debt](../d/debt.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md) with assets or other means to ensure they are payable over a long period. 

Funded [debt](../d/debt.md) is essential for companies as it allows them to [finance](../f/finance.md) substantial [capital](../c/capital.md) projects, [expansion](../e/expansion.md), and other long-term goals without immediately impacting their [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md). Understanding the various types of funded [debt](../d/debt.md) and their implications in corporate [accounting](../a/accounting.md) is crucial for investors, managers, and financial analysts. This document [will](../w/will.md) explore the different types of funded [debt](../d/debt.md), their characteristics, and how they influence corporate [accounting](../a/accounting.md).

## Understanding Funded Debt

Funded [debt](../d/debt.md) stands in contrast to [short-term debt](../s/short-term_debt.md), which needs to be settled within a year. It gives the issuing company more time to generate the necessary [revenue](../r/revenue.md) to cover the [debt](../d/debt.md) and is often used to [finance](../f/finance.md) large [capital](../c/capital.md) expenditures or [expansion](../e/expansion.md) projects. Because it stretches over several years, funded [debt](../d/debt.md) generally provides a more stable and predictable financial outlook for both the borrower and the [lender](../l/lender.md).

The key characteristics of funded [debt](../d/debt.md) include:

- **Long-Term [Maturity](../m/maturity.md)**: Typically more than one year, often ranging from 5 to 30 years.
- **[Interest](../i/interest.md) Payments**: Regular [interest](../i/interest.md) payments (coupons) are usually made semi-annually or annually.
- **[Principal](../p/principal.md) [Repayment](../r/repayment.md)**: The [principal](../p/principal.md), or the amount borrowed, is repaid at the end of the term or at set intervals.
- **[Security](../s/security.md)**: This can be secured (backed by assets) or unsecured (based solely on the company's [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md)).

## Types of Funded Debt

1. **Corporate Bonds**
    - Corporate bonds are a common form of funded [debt](../d/debt.md) where a company issues securities to investors to raise funds.
    - These bonds can be secured or unsecured, with varying terms and [interest](../i/interest.md) rates based on the company's [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) and [market](../m/market.md) conditions.
    - Examples include senior bonds, subordinated bonds, convertible bonds, and junk bonds.

2. **Term Loans**
    - Term loans are structured loans from financial institutions, typically with a [fixed interest rate](../f/fixed_interest_rate.md) and [repayment](../r/repayment.md) period.
    - They are often used for [capital](../c/capital.md) expenditures and expansions.
    - Unlike bonds, term loans usually do not have a public [market](../m/market.md) component.

3. **Debentures**
    - Debentures are unsecured bonds that rely on the [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) and reputation of the issuing company.
    - They generally [offer](../o/offer.md) higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates compared to secured bonds because they carry more [risk](../r/risk.md).
    - Debentures can be convertible, allowing investors to convert them into [equity](../e/equity.md).

4. **[Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) Bonds**
    - These are secured by specific [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) property and usually [offer](../o/offer.md) lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates due to the added [security](../s/security.md).
    - [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) bonds provide investors with a claim on the property used as [collateral](../c/collateral.md) in case of [default](../d/default.md).

5. **[Sinking Fund](../s/sinking_fund.md) Debts**
    - Some long-term debts require the company to set aside funds periodically to pay off the [principal](../p/principal.md).
    - Sinking funds reduce [default risk](../d/default_risk.md) by ensuring that funds are available to meet [debt](../d/debt.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md).

## Corporate Bonds

Corporate bonds are one of the most common forms of funded [debt](../d/debt.md). They represent a [loan](../l/loan.md) made by an [investor](../i/investor.md) to a [corporation](../c/corporation.md) in [exchange](../e/exchange.md) for periodic [interest](../i/interest.md) payments and the [return](../r/return.md) of the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s [face value](../f/face_value.md) upon [maturity](../m/maturity.md). Companies [issue](../i/issue.md) bonds for various reasons, including [expansion](../e/expansion.md), [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md), and refinancing existing debts.

### Characteristics of Corporate Bonds

- **Fixed [Interest](../i/interest.md) Payments**: Typically, corporate bonds pay a [fixed interest rate](../f/fixed_interest_rate.md) (coupon) that is paid semi-annually.
- **[Maturity Date](../m/maturity_date.md)**: Corporate bonds have varying maturities, commonly ranging from 5 to 30 years.
- **[Credit Rating](../c/credit_rating.md)**: The [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) of the issuing company affects the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md). Investment-grade bonds [offer](../o/offer.md) lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, while high-[yield](../y/yield.md) (junk) bonds [offer](../o/offer.md) higher rates but come with higher risks.
- **Callable and Convertible Features**: Some corporate bonds allow the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) to repay the [bond](../b/bond.md) or the [investor](../i/investor.md) to convert it into company stock under specific conditions.

Examples of major corporations issuing bonds include [Coca-Cola](https://investors.coca-colacompany.com/), [Apple](https://investor.apple.com/investor-relations/default.aspx), and [Ford](https://corporate.ford.com/). Their bonds are traded in public markets and rated by agencies like Moody's and S&P.

## Term Loans

Term loans are an alternative to bonds where a company borrows funds from banks or other financial institutions with a schedule for repayments, typically including both [interest](../i/interest.md) and [principal](../p/principal.md).

### Characteristics of Term Loans

- **Fixed or Variable [Interest](../i/interest.md) Rates**: Term loans can have either fixed [interest](../i/interest.md) rates or variable rates, which are tied to benchmarks like the LIBOR.
- **[Repayment](../r/repayment.md) Schedule**: They often require periodic [principal](../p/principal.md) repayments, reducing the outstanding [loan](../l/loan.md) amount over time.
- **[Collateral](../c/collateral.md)**: These loans might be secured by company assets, adding an extra layer of [security](../s/security.md) for the [lender](../l/lender.md).
- **Covenants**: Lenders might impose covenants or conditions on the borrower, such as maintaining certain [financial ratios](../f/financial_ratios.md).

Term loans are usually tailored to the specific needs of the borrowing company, providing flexible financial solutions for large investments or operations.

## Debentures

Debentures represent unsecured loans issued by companies, relying solely on the [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) and general reputation of the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) rather than any specific [collateral](../c/collateral.md).

### Characteristics of Debentures

- **Higher [Risk](../r/risk.md) and [Return](../r/return.md)**: Due to the lack of [collateral](../c/collateral.md), debentures typically [offer](../o/offer.md) higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates to attract investors.
- **Convertible Features**: Some debentures can be converted into [equity](../e/equity.md) [shares](../s/shares.md) at the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s discretion, providing a potential [upside](../u/upside.md) if the company's stock performs well.
- **[Interest](../i/interest.md) Payments**: [Interest](../i/interest.md) payments on debentures are similar to those of bonds, typically paid semi-annually or annually.

Companies with strong reputations and stable [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) often [issue](../i/issue.md) debentures to take advantage of lower regulatory requirements compared to secured [debt](../d/debt.md) instruments.

## Mortgage Bonds

[Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) bonds are secured by the company's [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) [holdings](../h/holdings.md), providing a more secure investment option for bondholders.

### Characteristics of Mortgage Bonds

- **Collateralized**: The primary feature of [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) bonds is the [collateral](../c/collateral.md) backing, usually in the form of the [issuer](../i/issuer.md)'s [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) properties.
- **Lower [Interest](../i/interest.md) Rates**: Given the added [security](../s/security.md) of [collateral](../c/collateral.md), [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) bonds generally [offer](../o/offer.md) lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates compared to unsecured bonds.
- **Lower [Default Risk](../d/default_risk.md)**: In the event of [default](../d/default.md), the bondholders have a claim on the property used as [collateral](../c/collateral.md), reducing their exposure to loss.

[Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) bonds are particularly suitable for companies with substantial [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) assets, providing a means to [leverage](../l/leverage.md) these assets for funding.

## Sinking Fund Debts

Certain funded debts come with a [sinking fund](../s/sinking_fund.md) [provision](../p/provision.md), requiring the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) to regularly allocate funds to a reserve account designated for repaying the [debt](../d/debt.md).

### Characteristics of Sinking Fund Debts

- **Regular Reserve Contributions**: Issuers must periodically contribute to a [sinking fund](../s/sinking_fund.md), reducing the [risk](../r/risk.md) of [default](../d/default.md) by ensuring funds are available for [principal](../p/principal.md) [repayment](../r/repayment.md).
- **Lower [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: The reserve decreases the issuance's [risk](../r/risk.md) profile, often resulting in lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.
- **[Investor](../i/investor.md) Protection**: A [sinking fund](../s/sinking_fund.md) provides additional [security](../s/security.md) for investors, assuring them that the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) is actively managing its [repayment](../r/repayment.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md).

Sinking funds are a prudent financial mechanism, promoting fiscal discipline and [investor](../i/investor.md) confidence in the company's [long-term debt](../l/long-term_debt.md) management strategy.

## Impact on Corporate Accounting

Funded [debt](../d/debt.md) has significant implications for corporate [accounting](../a/accounting.md), impacting various aspects of [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) and [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md).

### Balance Sheet

Funded [debt](../d/debt.md) appears on the liabilities side of a company's [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) under [long-term liabilities](../l/long-term_liabilities.md). This [debt](../d/debt.md) must be diligently monitored to ensure accurate recording of [interest](../i/interest.md) expenses, [principal](../p/principal.md) repayments, and compliance with covenants.

### Income Statement

[Interest](../i/interest.md) payments on funded [debt](../d/debt.md) are recorded as [interest expense](../i/interest_expense.md) on the [income statement](../i/income_statement.md). These payments reduce the company's pre-tax [income](../i/income.md) and, consequently, its net [income](../i/income.md).

### Cash Flow Statement

Funded [debt](../d/debt.md) influences the [cash flow statement](../c/cash_flow_statement.md) in the [financing](../f/financing.md) activities section. Issuance of new [debt](../d/debt.md) shows up as cash inflow, while repayments of [principal](../p/principal.md) appear as cash outflows.

### Financial Ratios

Funded [debt](../d/debt.md) affects various [financial ratios](../f/financial_ratios.md), providing insights into the company's [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and [leverage](../l/leverage.md):

- **[Debt](../d/debt.md)-to-[Equity](../e/equity.md) Ratio**: This ratio measures the company's [leverage](../l/leverage.md) and [risk](../r/risk.md) profile, comparing funded [debt](../d/debt.md) to shareholders' [equity](../e/equity.md).
- **[Interest Coverage Ratio](../i/interest_coverage_ratio.md)**: This ratio assesses the company's ability to meet [interest](../i/interest.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md), calculated by dividing [earnings](../e/earnings.md) before [interest](../i/interest.md) and [taxes](../t/taxes.md) (EBIT) by [interest expense](../i/interest_expense.md).
- **[Debt Service](../d/debt_service.md) [Coverage Ratio](../c/coverage_ratio.md)**: This ratio evaluates the company's ability to service its [debt](../d/debt.md), considering both [interest](../i/interest.md) and [principal](../p/principal.md) repayments.

Understanding the impact of funded [debt](../d/debt.md) on these ratios is crucial for investors and analysts when assessing a company's [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and long-term stability.

## Conclusion

Funded [debt](../d/debt.md) plays a critical role in [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md), providing companies with the [capital](../c/capital.md) necessary to pursue long-term projects and growth opportunities. By understanding the various types of funded [debt](../d/debt.md) and their implications for corporate [accounting](../a/accounting.md), stakeholders can make informed decisions and accurately assess a company's financial viability. Whether through corporate bonds, term loans, debentures, [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) bonds, or [sinking fund](../s/sinking_fund.md) provisions, funded [debt](../d/debt.md) offers flexible financial solutions while demanding disciplined financial management and [transparency](../t/transparency.md).

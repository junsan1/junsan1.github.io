# Forward Contract

A forward contract is a [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) used in the world of trading and [finance](../f/finance.md). It is a customized contract between two parties, where the buyer agrees to purchase and the seller agrees to sell an [asset](../a/asset.md) at a predetermined future date for a price specified today. Unlike standardized [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) that are traded on exchanges, [forward contracts](../f/forward_contracts.md) are typically traded over-the-counter (OTC) and are more flexible in terms of terms and conditions, including the settlement date, contract size, and [asset](../a/asset.md) type.

The application of [forward contracts](../f/forward_contracts.md) is widespread across various financial and [commodity](../c/commodity.md) markets. This document aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of [forward contracts](../f/forward_contracts.md), covering their structure, types, [valuation](../v/valuation.md), uses, and risks associated with them.

## Structure of Forward Contracts

### Key Elements

1. **Counterparties:** [Forward contracts](../f/forward_contracts.md) involve two parties, the buyer (long position) and the seller (short position).
2. **[Underlying Asset](../u/underlying_asset.md):** The [asset](../a/asset.md) can be a [commodity](../c/commodity.md), [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md), or any other item agreed upon by the parties.
3. **Contract Price ([Forward Price](../f/forward_price.md)):** The agreed-upon price at which the [asset](../a/asset.md) [will](../w/will.md) be bought or sold at the future date.
4. **Settlement Date (Delivery Date):** The date on which the [transaction](../t/transaction.md) [will](../w/will.md) be executed.

### Customization

Since [forward contracts](../f/forward_contracts.md) are traded OTC, they can be tailored to meet the specific needs of the [counterparty](../c/counterparty.md). This customization includes flexibility in:

- Contract size
- Settlement procedures
- [Asset](../a/asset.md) delivery location
- Contract [maturity](../m/maturity.md)

## Types of Forward Contracts

### 1. **Non-Deliverable Forwards (NDFs):**
NDFs are cash-settled contracts, meaning that no [physical delivery](../p/physical_delivery_in_trading.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) takes place. Instead, the [gain](../g/gain.md) or loss is settled in cash.

### 2. **Deliverable Forwards:**
These require the [physical delivery](../p/physical_delivery_in_trading.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at the contract's [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md).

### 3. **Foreign Exchange Forwards:**
These are commonly used in the forex [market](../m/market.md) to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against [currency](../c/currency.md) [risk](../r/risk.md). They involve the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) of two currencies at a specified future date and rate.

### 4. **Interest Rate Forwards:**
These involve the forward-[forward rate](../f/forward_rate.md) or [forward rate](../f/forward_rate.md) agreements (FRAs) specifically related to future [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

## Valuation of Forward Contracts

Valuing a forward contract involves determining the [forward price](../f/forward_price.md). The price of a forward contract can be derived using the cost of carry model, which takes into account the [spot price](../s/spot_price.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md), and any carrying costs associated. The formula is as follows:

\[ F = S \times e^{(r \times t)} \]

where:
- \( F \) = [Forward price](../f/forward_price.md)
- \( S \) = [Spot price](../s/spot_price.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)
- \( r \) = [Risk](../r/risk.md)-free [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md)
- \( t \) = Time to [maturity](../m/maturity.md) (in years)

### Cost of Carry

The cost of carry includes any costs associated with holding the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) until the forward contract's settlement date. These may include storage costs, [insurance](../i/insurance.md), and [financing](../f/financing.md) costs.

## Applications of Forward Contracts

### Hedging

[Forward contracts](../f/forward_contracts.md) are extensively used for hedging purposes. They allow businesses and investors to lock in prices and protect against unfavorable price movements in the future.

#### Example:

A wheat farmer may enter into a forward contract to sell a specific quantity of wheat at a predetermined price and future date, thereby hedifying against the [risk](../r/risk.md) of price declines.

### Speculation

Speculators also use [forward contracts](../f/forward_contracts.md) to [profit](../p/profit.md) from anticipated price movements in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). By taking a position in a forward contract, speculators can potentially benefit from favorable changes in price.

### Arbitrage

Arbitrageurs exploit price discrepancies between the spot and forward markets. They engage in simultaneous buying and selling practices to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on these inefficiencies.

## Risks Associated with Forward Contracts

Despite their benefits, [forward contracts](../f/forward_contracts.md) carry inherent risks:

1. **[Credit Risk](../c/credit_risk.md):** The [risk](../r/risk.md) that one party may [default](../d/default.md) on the contract.
2. **[Market Risk](../m/market_risk.md):** Fluctuations in the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) can lead to potential losses.
3. **[Liquidity Risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md):** Since [forward contracts](../f/forward_contracts.md) are OTC instruments, finding a [counterparty](../c/counterparty.md) to [offset](../o/offset.md) the contract can be challenging.
4. **[Operational Risk](../o/operational_risk.md):** Errors in contract [execution](../e/execution.md), settlement processes, and other operational aspects can affect the performance of the contract.

## Conclusion

[Forward contracts](../f/forward_contracts.md) are pivotal in the world of [finance](../f/finance.md) and trading, [offering](../o/offering.md) versatile tools for hedging, speculating, and [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md). The customization aspect of these contracts makes them highly attractive but also introduces unique risks that must be carefully managed. [Forward contracts](../f/forward_contracts.md) play a crucial role in managing future uncertainties and providing financial stability for various [market](../m/market.md) participants.

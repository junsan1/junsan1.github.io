# Floating Interest Rate

Floating [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, also known as adjustable or variable [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, are an essential concept in the realm of [finance](../f/finance.md), including [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) (algotrading). They contrast with fixed [interest](../i/interest.md) rates by varying over time based on changes in an [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) or [index](../i/index.md). This rate adjustment mechanism influences various financial instruments, including loans, mortgages, bonds, and [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md).

## Definition and Mechanism

A floating [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) changes periodically, typically in [correlation](../c/correlation.md) with a standard [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) [index](../i/index.md). Common benchmarks include:

- **LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate)**: An average [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) estimated by leading banks in London which they would charge to borrow from other banks.
- **SOFR (Secured Overnight [Financing](../f/financing.md) Rate)**: A broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities.
- **[Federal Funds Rate](../f/federal_funds_rate.md)**: The [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) banks charge each other for overnight loans within the Federal Reserve system.

### Adjustment Periods

Floating [interest](../i/interest.md) rates adjust at specified intervals, such as monthly, quarterly, or annually, depending on the terms of the [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) or contract. These adjustments ensure that the rate reflects the most current [market](../m/market.md) conditions, allowing for potential benefits from falling [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and conversely adding [risk](../r/risk.md) when rates rise.

### Components

A floating [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) typically consists of:
- **[Index](../i/index.md) or [Benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) Rate**: The base rate that fluctuates over time.
- **Spread or [Margin](../m/margin.md)**: An additional fixed percentage added to the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) rate. This spread represents the [lender](../l/lender.md)'s [profit margin](../p/profit_margin.md) and compensates for various risks.

For example, a floating rate [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) might be expressed as LIBOR + 2%. If the current LIBOR is 1.5%, the [interest](../i/interest.md) for that period would be 3.5%.

## Applications in Algorithmic Trading

In [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), floating [interest](../i/interest.md) rates influence several aspects, from the pricing of [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) to the strategy development for trading [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md)-sensitive instruments.

### Derivatives Pricing

Many [derivative](../d/derivative.md) products, such as [interest rate swaps](../i/interest_rate_swaps.md), [options](../o/options.md), and [futures](../f/futures.md), involve floating [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. For instance, in an [interest rate swap](../i/interest_rate_swap.md), one party pays a fixed rate while receiving a floating rate, often linked to LIBOR. Modelling and predicting changes in these rates are crucial for:
- **[Valuation](../v/valuation.md)**: Accurate pricing of swaps, [options](../o/options.md), and [futures](../f/futures.md).
- **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Assessing and [hedging exposure](../h/hedging_exposure.md) to [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md).
- **[Arbitrage Opportunities](../a/arbitrage_opportunities.md)**: Identifying and exploiting price discrepancies in related instruments.

### Statistical Arbitrage

Floating [interest](../i/interest.md) rates can be a key [factor](../f/factor.md) in statistical [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategies, where traders exploit statistical mispricings between related financial instruments. By using historical data and sophisticated models, traders predict future movements and [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on anticipated changes in floating rates.

### High-Frequency Trading (HFT)

In HFT, algorithms execute a large number of orders at extremely fast speeds to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on minute price discrepancies. Floating [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) movements can create opportunities in:
- **Short-term [bond](../b/bond.md) trading**: Rapid trades based on expected changes in short-term [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.
- **Forex markets**: [Currency](../c/currency.md) pairs are sensitive to [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) differentials, making floating rates a crucial parameter.

## Risk Management

One of the significant challenges in dealing with floating [interest](../i/interest.md) rates is managing the inherent [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md), which is the danger of financial losses due to adverse movements in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

### Hedging Strategies

[Hedging strategies](../h/hedging_strategies.md) using [financial derivatives](../f/financial_derivatives.md) can mitigate the risks associated with floating [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. Common instruments include:
- **[Interest Rate Swaps](../i/interest_rate_swaps.md)**: Exchanging floating rate payments for fixed rate payments.
- **Caps and Floors**: [Options](../o/options.md) that set upper (caps) and lower (floors) limits on [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) movements.
- **[Forward Rate](../f/forward_rate.md) Agreements (FRAs)**: Contracts that fix an [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) for a future period.

### Duration and Convexity

Understanding the concepts of [duration](../d/duration.md) and [convexity](../c/convexity.md) is critical for managing [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md). 
- **[Duration](../d/duration.md)**: Measures a [bond](../b/bond.md)'s sensitivity to changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, indicating how much the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s price [will](../w/will.md) change with a 1% change in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.
- **[Convexity](../c/convexity.md)**: Refines the [duration](../d/duration.md) measure to account for the curvature in the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s price-[yield](../y/yield.md) relationship, providing a better estimate of price changes for larger [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) movements.

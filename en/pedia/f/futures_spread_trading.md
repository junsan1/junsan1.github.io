# Futures Spread Trading

[Futures](../f/futures.md) [spread trading](../s/spread_trading.md) is a sophisticated form of trading in the [futures](../f/futures.md) markets where traders simultaneously go long (buy) and short (sell) on related [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) to [profit](../p/profit.md) from the changes in the price difference between the two contracts, rather than from the absolute price movements of the individual contracts. This strategy is also known as [spread betting](../s/spread_betting.md), and it capitalizes on the relative movement of prices between two [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) rather than speculating on the direction of a single [futures market](../f/futures_market.md).

## Understanding Futures Spreads

At its core, a [futures](../f/futures.md) spread involves the purchase of one [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) and the simultaneous [sale](../s/sale.md) of a related [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md). The primary objective is to [profit](../p/profit.md) from changes in the price differential between these two contracts. The difference in price between the two contracts is known as the "spread". Here's a detailed look at the types and mechanics of [futures](../f/futures.md) [spreads](../s/spreads.md):

### Types of Futures Spreads

1. **Intra-[Market](../m/market.md) Spread (Calendar Spread)**:
    - **Definition**: This spread involves taking long and short positions in the same [commodity](../c/commodity.md) but in different delivery months within the same [exchange](../e/exchange.md).
    - **Example**: Buying a November [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md) [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) and selling a January [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md) [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md).
    
2. **Inter-[Market](../m/market.md) Spread**:
    - **Definition**: This involves taking long and short positions in the same delivery month but in related commodities on the same [exchange](../e/exchange.md).
    - **Example**: Buying a [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md) [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) and selling a heating oil [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) for the same delivery month.
    
3. **Inter-[Exchange](../e/exchange.md) Spread**:
    - **Definition**: This involves taking long and short positions in the same [commodity](../c/commodity.md) and delivery month but on different exchanges.
    - **Example**: Buying a wheat [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) on the Chicago Board of [Trade](../t/trade.md) (CBOT) and selling a wheat [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) on the Minneapolis Grain [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (MGEX).

4. **[Commodity](../c/commodity.md) Product Spread**: 
    - **Definition**: This spread involves commodities where the end product and the raw material are traded. 
    - **Example**: Buying soybean oil [futures](../f/futures.md) and selling soybean meal [futures](../f/futures.md).

### The Mechanics of Spread Trading

#### Margin Requirements

One of the appeals of [spread trading](../s/spread_trading.md) is the reduced [margin](../m/margin.md) requirements compared to outright [futures](../f/futures.md) positions. This reduced [margin](../m/margin.md) is a reflection of the lower [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with spread positions. Exchanges typically [offer](../o/offer.md) reduced [margin](../m/margin.md) rates for [spreads](../s/spreads.md) because the simultaneous long and short positions in correlated contracts [offset](../o/offset.md) each other's [risk](../r/risk.md).

#### Spread Quotations

[Spreads](../s/spreads.md) are quoted as price differences between the contracts. For example, if the price of a December wheat [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) is $5.20 per bushel and the price of a March wheat [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) is $5.30 per bushel, the spread is quoted as -$0.10. A [trader](../t/trader.md) who buys the December contract and sells the March contract is said to be long the spread.

#### Execution

Traders can execute spread positions through a single [order](../o/order.md) using a spread [order book](../o/order_book.md) on the [exchange](../e/exchange.md), where the spread itself is the tradable instrument. Alternatively, traders can manually construct [spreads](../s/spreads.md) by entering individual legs of the spread [trade](../t/trade.md) separately.

## Strategies in Futures Spread Trading

### Bull and Bear Spreads

- **[Bull Spread](../b/bull_spread.md)**: A [trader](../t/trader.md) would establish a [bull spread](../b/bull_spread.md) by buying the near-month contract and selling the far-month contract in an intra-[market](../m/market.md) (calendar) spread. This strategy profits if the near-month contract price increases relative to the far-month contract.
- **[Bear Spread](../b/bear_spread.md)**: Conversely, a [bear spread](../b/bear_spread.md) involves selling the near-month contract and buying the far-month contract. This strategy profits when the near-month contract price decreases relative to the far-month contract.

### Inter-Commodity Spreads

Traders apply inter-[commodity](../c/commodity.md) [spreads](../s/spreads.md) to exploit the price movements between related commodities. For example, a common strategy in the energy markets is the crack spread, where a [trader](../t/trader.md) might buy [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md) [futures](../f/futures.md) and sell refined products like gasoline or heating oil [futures](../f/futures.md).

### Seasonal Spreads

Some commodities show seasonal price tendencies, and traders [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on these patterns by entering [spreads](../s/spreads.md) that align with historical seasonal trends. For instance, the grain markets might [offer](../o/offer.md) opportunities for spread trades based on planting, growing, and harvest cycles.

### Statistical Arbitrage

This involves using [quantitative models](../q/quantitative_models.md) and statistical methods to identify and exploit temporary deviations from the normal relationships between [futures](../f/futures.md) prices. Traders use historical data to build models predicting typical spread behavior and then [trade](../t/trade.md) deviations from this norm.

## Advantages of Futures Spread Trading

1. **Lower [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: Since [spreads](../s/spreads.md) involve long and short positions in related contracts, they inherently carry less [risk](../r/risk.md) compared to outright positions. The offsetting positions reduce the impact of adverse price movements.
2. **Reduced [Margin](../m/margin.md) Requirements**: Exchanges recognize the lower [risk](../r/risk.md) profile of spread trades and, therefore, [offer](../o/offer.md) significantly lower [margin](../m/margin.md) requirements.
3. **Reduced [Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: [Spreads](../s/spreads.md) are generally less volatile than outright [futures](../f/futures.md) positions because the movement in one [leg](../l/leg.md) of the spread is often partially [offset](../o/offset.md) by movement in the other [leg](../l/leg.md).
4. **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: [Spreads](../s/spreads.md) allow traders to diversify by taking positions in different but related markets. This reduces the [risk](../r/risk.md) of drastic losses.
5. **Exploiting [Market](../m/market.md) Inefficiencies**: [Spread trading](../s/spread_trading.md) can exploit inefficiencies in the [market](../m/market.md) pricing of related [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md), [offering](../o/offering.md) opportunities for [profit](../p/profit.md) that are not available through outright positions.

## Risks in Futures Spread Trading

1. **[Execution Risk](../e/execution_risk.md)**: Manual [execution](../e/execution.md) of [spreads](../s/spreads.md) can lead to [execution risk](../e/execution_risk.md), where one [leg](../l/leg.md) of the spread is filled and the other is not, leading to potential unwanted outright exposure.
2. **Unexpected Correlations**: Although spread trades are designed to benefit from correlated movements, those correlations can break down, leading to unexpected losses.
3. **[Liquidity Risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md)**: Not all [spreads](../s/spreads.md) are equally [liquid](../l/liquid.md). The ease of entering and exiting spread positions can vary significantly, potentially leading to difficulties in managing trades, especially in volatile markets.

## Technological Aspects in Futures Spread Trading

### Algorithmic Trading in Spreads

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), or algo-trading, uses computer algorithms to [trade](../t/trade.md) [spreads](../s/spreads.md) efficiently. These algorithms can automatically identify, execute, and manage spread positions based on pre-defined criteria without human intervention.

### High-Frequency Trading (HFT)

High-frequency trading firms use advanced technology to execute trades at extremely high speeds, often exploiting very short-term inefficiencies in the [market](../m/market.md). This can include trading intraday [spreads](../s/spreads.md) where they benefit from the rapid movements in the price differentials.

### Trading Platforms

Several technological platforms provide tools for spread traders, including real-time spread charts, analytics, historical data, and automated trading capabilities. Examples include:

- **[CQG](../c/cqg.md)**: Offers advanced charting and analytics specifically tailored for [spread trading](../s/spread_trading.md). More information can be found on their official website [here](https://www.cqg.com).

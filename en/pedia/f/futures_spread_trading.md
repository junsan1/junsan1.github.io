# Futures Spread Trading

Futures [spread trading](../s/spread_trading.md) is a sophisticated form of trading in the futures markets where traders simultaneously go long (buy) and short (sell) on related [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) to profit from the changes in the price difference between the two contracts, rather than from the absolute price movements of the individual contracts. This strategy is also known as [spread betting](../s/spread_betting.md), and it capitalizes on the relative movement of prices between two [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) rather than speculating on the direction of a single futures market.

## Understanding Futures Spreads

At its core, a futures spread involves the purchase of one futures contract and the simultaneous sale of a related futures contract. The primary objective is to profit from changes in the price differential between these two contracts. The difference in price between the two contracts is known as the "spread". Here's a detailed look at the types and mechanics of futures spreads:

### Types of Futures Spreads

1. **Intra-Market Spread (Calendar Spread)**:
    - **Definition**: This spread involves taking long and short positions in the same commodity but in different delivery months within the same exchange.
    - **Example**: Buying a November crude oil futures contract and selling a January crude oil futures contract.
    
2. **Inter-Market Spread**:
    - **Definition**: This involves taking long and short positions in the same delivery month but in related commodities on the same exchange.
    - **Example**: Buying a crude oil futures contract and selling a heating oil futures contract for the same delivery month.
    
3. **Inter-Exchange Spread**:
    - **Definition**: This involves taking long and short positions in the same commodity and delivery month but on different exchanges.
    - **Example**: Buying a wheat futures contract on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) and selling a wheat futures contract on the Minneapolis Grain Exchange (MGEX).

4. **Commodity Product Spread**: 
    - **Definition**: This spread involves commodities where the end product and the raw material are traded. 
    - **Example**: Buying soybean oil futures and selling soybean meal futures.

### The Mechanics of Spread Trading

#### Margin Requirements

One of the appeals of [spread trading](../s/spread_trading.md) is the reduced margin requirements compared to outright futures positions. This reduced margin is a reflection of the lower risk associated with spread positions. Exchanges typically offer reduced margin rates for spreads because the simultaneous long and short positions in correlated contracts offset each other's risk.

#### Spread Quotations

Spreads are quoted as price differences between the contracts. For example, if the price of a December wheat futures contract is $5.20 per bushel and the price of a March wheat futures contract is $5.30 per bushel, the spread is quoted as -$0.10. A trader who buys the December contract and sells the March contract is said to be long the spread.

#### Execution

Traders can execute spread positions through a single order using a spread order book on the exchange, where the spread itself is the tradable instrument. Alternatively, traders can manually construct spreads by entering individual legs of the spread trade separately.

## Strategies in Futures Spread Trading

### Bull and Bear Spreads

- **Bull Spread**: A trader would establish a bull spread by buying the near-month contract and selling the far-month contract in an intra-market (calendar) spread. This strategy profits if the near-month contract price increases relative to the far-month contract.
- **Bear Spread**: Conversely, a bear spread involves selling the near-month contract and buying the far-month contract. This strategy profits when the near-month contract price decreases relative to the far-month contract.

### Inter-Commodity Spreads

Traders apply inter-commodity spreads to exploit the price movements between related commodities. For example, a common strategy in the energy markets is the crack spread, where a trader might buy crude oil futures and sell refined products like gasoline or heating oil futures.

### Seasonal Spreads

Some commodities show seasonal price tendencies, and traders capitalize on these patterns by entering spreads that align with historical seasonal trends. For instance, the grain markets might offer opportunities for spread trades based on planting, growing, and harvest cycles.

### Statistical Arbitrage

This involves using [quantitative models](../q/quantitative_models.md) and statistical methods to identify and exploit temporary deviations from the normal relationships between futures prices. Traders use historical data to build models predicting typical spread behavior and then trade deviations from this norm.

## Advantages of Futures Spread Trading

1. **Lower Risk**: Since spreads involve long and short positions in related contracts, they inherently carry less risk compared to outright positions. The offsetting positions reduce the impact of adverse price movements.
2. **Reduced Margin Requirements**: Exchanges recognize the lower risk profile of spread trades and, therefore, offer significantly lower margin requirements.
3. **Reduced Volatility**: Spreads are generally less volatile than outright futures positions because the movement in one leg of the spread is often partially offset by movement in the other leg.
4. **Diversification**: Spreads allow traders to diversify by taking positions in different but related markets. This reduces the risk of drastic losses.
5. **Exploiting Market Inefficiencies**: [Spread trading](../s/spread_trading.md) can exploit inefficiencies in the market pricing of related [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md), offering opportunities for profit that are not available through outright positions.

## Risks in Futures Spread Trading

1. **[Execution Risk](../e/execution_risk.md)**: Manual execution of spreads can lead to [execution risk](../e/execution_risk.md), where one leg of the spread is filled and the other is not, leading to potential unwanted outright exposure.
2. **Unexpected Correlations**: Although spread trades are designed to benefit from correlated movements, those correlations can break down, leading to unexpected losses.
3. **[Liquidity Risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md)**: Not all spreads are equally liquid. The ease of entering and exiting spread positions can vary significantly, potentially leading to difficulties in managing trades, especially in volatile markets.

## Technological Aspects in Futures Spread Trading

### Algorithmic Trading in Spreads

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), or algo-trading, uses computer algorithms to trade spreads efficiently. These algorithms can automatically identify, execute, and manage spread positions based on pre-defined criteria without human intervention.

### High-Frequency Trading (HFT)

High-frequency trading firms use advanced technology to execute trades at extremely high speeds, often exploiting very short-term inefficiencies in the market. This can include trading intraday spreads where they benefit from the rapid movements in the price differentials.

### Trading Platforms

Several technological platforms provide tools for spread traders, including real-time spread charts, analytics, historical data, and automated trading capabilities. Examples include:

- **[CQG](../c/cqg.md)**: Offers advanced charting and analytics specifically tailored for [spread trading](../s/spread_trading.md). More information can be found on their official website [here](https://www.cqg.com).
- **[Trading Technologies](../t/trading_technologies.md) (TT)**: Known for its robust [spread trading](../s/spread_trading.md) functionalities and execution tools. Their products cater extensively to professional spread traders. Visit their website [here](https://www.tradingtechnologies.com).

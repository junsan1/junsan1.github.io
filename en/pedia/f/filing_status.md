# Filing Status

Filing status is a classification that determines the type of [tax return](../t/tax_return.md) form an individual [will](../w/will.md) use, the [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md) that [will](../w/will.md) apply, and certain eligibility requirements for various tax benefits and credits. Your filing status (also known as your "status at filing") is one of the most important factors in figuring out your [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md) and the amount of tax you have to pay.

## Types of Filing Status

There are five main filing statuses:

### Single
- **Definition**: If you are not married, divorced, or legally separated according to your state's law as of the last day of the tax year, you would generally file as Single.
- **Who Qualifies?**: Those who are unmarried, legally separated, or divorced.
- **Key Attributes**: Filing as Single may result in fewer deductions compared to some other statuses, such as [Married Filing Jointly](../m/married_filing_jointly.md).

### Married Filing Jointly
- **Definition**: Married couples can choose to file one [joint](../j/joint.md) [tax return](../t/tax_return.md).
- **Who Qualifies?**: Married couples who are married as of December 31 of the tax year.
- **Key Attributes**: This status generally provides the most tax advantages including double the [standard deduction](../s/standard_deduction.md) and eligibility for various tax credits.

### Married Filing Separately
- **Definition**: Married taxpayers may choose to file their own separate tax returns.
- **Who Qualifies?**: Married individuals who prefer to file separately.
- **Key Attributes**: Often yields higher [taxes](../t/taxes.md) compared to filing jointly but may be beneficial in circumstances where one spouse has significant deductions or expenses.

### Head of Household
- **Definition**: This status is for individuals who are not married and provide a [home](../h/home.md) for certain other persons.
- **Who Qualifies?**: Unmarried taxpayers who pay more than half the cost of keeping up a [home](../h/home.md) for a qualifying person.
- **Key Attributes**: Offers lower tax rates and a higher [standard deduction](../s/standard_deduction.md) than Single status.

### Qualifying Widow(er) with Dependent Child
- **Definition**: Provides a special tax status for those who have lost a spouse.
- **Who Qualifies?**: Widows or widowers who have a dependent child and did not remarry within the two years following the spouse's death.
- **Key Attributes**: Allows widowers to use the same tax rates as [Married Filing Jointly](../m/married_filing_jointly.md) for two years following the spouse's death.

## Determining Filing Status

Filing status impacts several areas including:
- **[Standard Deduction](../s/standard_deduction.md)**: Different statuses provide different [standard deduction](../s/standard_deduction.md) amounts.
- **[Tax Brackets](../t/tax_brackets.md)**: Determines which tax bracket you fall into.
- **Eligibility for Credits/Deductions**: Some tax benefits are specific to particular filing statuses.

## Impact on Tax Calculations

### Standard Deduction
- **Single**: The [standard deduction](../s/standard_deduction.md) for the Single status is relatively low.
- **[Married Filing Jointly](../m/married_filing_jointly.md)**: Offers the highest [standard deduction](../s/standard_deduction.md).
- **[Married Filing Separately](../m/married_filing_separately.md)**: Each spouse has their own [standard deduction](../s/standard_deduction.md), which combined usually amounts to the same as [Married Filing Jointly](../m/married_filing_jointly.md).
- **[Head of Household](../h/head_of_household.md)**: Provides a higher [standard deduction](../s/standard_deduction.md) than Single but less than [Married Filing Jointly](../m/married_filing_jointly.md).
- **Qualifying Widow(er)**: Matches the [standard deduction](../s/standard_deduction.md) for [Married Filing Jointly](../m/married_filing_jointly.md).

### Tax Brackets
Each filing status has its own tax bracket thresholds, impacting the percentage of [income](../i/income.md) that is payable in [taxes](../t/taxes.md):
- **Single and [Married Filing Separately](../m/married_filing_separately.md)**: Generally, these statuses have narrow [tax brackets](../t/tax_brackets.md).
- **[Married Filing Jointly](../m/married_filing_jointly.md) and Qualifying Widow(er)**: These statuses provide broader [tax brackets](../t/tax_brackets.md).
- **[Head of Household](../h/head_of_household.md)**: Offers intermediate bracket thresholds, providing some relief compared to Single.

### Eligibility for Credits and Deductions
Various credits and deductions are contingent on the filing status:
- **[Earned Income](../e/earned_income.md) [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md) (EITC)**: Available to low-to-moderate-[income](../i/income.md) workers and families. Different [income](../i/income.md) limits apply depending on your status.
- **[Child Tax Credit](../c/child_tax_credit.md)**: Enhanced benefits may apply for different statuses.
- **Education Credits**: Credits like the [Lifetime Learning Credit](../l/lifetime_learning_credit.md) have phase-out limits dependent on the filing status.

## Changing Filing Status

Taxpayers can change their filing status under varying conditions; here are some common scenarios:
- **Marriage**: Changing from Single or [Head of Household](../h/head_of_household.md) to [Married Filing Jointly](../m/married_filing_jointly.md) or Separately.
- **Divorce/Separation**: May switch from [Married Filing Jointly](../m/married_filing_jointly.md) to Single or [Head of Household](../h/head_of_household.md).
- **Death of a Spouse**: Transition to Qualifying Widow(er) status for two years post spouseâ€™s death, and then to Single or [Head of Household](../h/head_of_household.md).

## Real-Life Examples

### Married Filing Jointly vs. Separately
A couple where one partner has a significant amount of medical expenses may benefit from filing separately to take advantage of itemized deductions.

### Head of Household
A single parent who maintains a [home](../h/home.md) for their children qualifies for [Head of Household](../h/head_of_household.md), receiving better tax rates and a higher [standard deduction](../s/standard_deduction.md).

### Qualifying Widow(er)
A widow with a dependent child can continue to benefit from the tax rates applicable to [Married Filing Jointly](../m/married_filing_jointly.md) for up to two years following the death of their spouse.

## Conclusion

Selecting the correct filing status is essential for accurate tax reporting and optimizing tax benefits. Taxpayers should evaluate their marital status, dependents, and financial circumstances to determine the most appropriate filing status.

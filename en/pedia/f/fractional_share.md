# Fractional Share

## Introduction
A fractional share is a portion of an [equity](../e/equity.md) stock that is less than one full share. Traditionally, [stocks](../s/stock.md) are bought and sold in whole share quantities, but with the advent of online trading platforms and a shift towards more inclusive investment [options](../o/options.md), the ability to purchase fractional [shares](../s/shares.md) has become increasingly popular. This innovation allows investors to diversify their portfolios and invest in companies whose stock prices may be prohibitively high in full-share increments.

## How Fractional Shares Work
Fractional [shares](../s/shares.md) are typically created as a result of various circumstances, such as stock splits, [dividend reinvestment](../d/dividend_reinvestment.md) plans (DRIPs), and mergers or acquisitions. In recent years, many brokerage firms have begun [offering](../o/offering.md) investors the ability to purchase fractional [shares](../s/shares.md) directly.

1. **Stock Splits:** When a company issues a [stock split](../s/stock_split.md), existing [shares](../s/shares.md) are divided into [multiple](../m/multiple.md) new [shares](../s/shares.md). For instance, a 3-for-2 [stock split](../s/stock_split.md) would convert each 2 [shares](../s/shares.md) a [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) holds into 3 [shares](../s/shares.md). This can result in fractional [shares](../s/shares.md) if the [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) does not [hold](../h/hold.md) the requisite number of [shares](../s/shares.md) to be evenly divided.

2. **[Dividend Reinvestment](../d/dividend_reinvestment.md) Plans (DRIPs):** When companies [issue](../i/issue.md) dividends, some shareholders opt to reinvest these dividends back into purchasing additional [shares](../s/shares.md) of stock. This often results in the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) of fractional [shares](../s/shares.md) since the [dividend](../d/dividend.md) amount may not be enough to purchase a full share.

3. **Brokerage Purchase Programs:** Many modern brokerage firms such as [Robinhood](../r/robinhood.md), [M1](../m/m1.md) [Finance](../f/finance.md), and Fidelity now [offer](../o/offer.md) fractional share [investing](../i/investing.md) as an explicit feature. This allows investors to specify the dollar amount they wish to invest rather than the number of [shares](../s/shares.md), thus facilitating the purchase of fractions of [shares](../s/shares.md).

## Benefits of Fractional Shares
[Investing](../i/investing.md) in fractional [shares](../s/shares.md) comes with a number of advantages that are particularly appealing to individual investors.

1. **Increased Accessibility:** High-priced [stocks](../s/stock.md), such as those of major tech companies, can be out of reach for small investors. Fractional [shares](../s/shares.md) lower the entry barrier, allowing more people to invest in high-[value](../v/value.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) without needing to commit large sums of [money](../m/money.md).

2. **Enhanced [Diversification](../d/diversification.md):** With the ability to purchase fractional [shares](../s/shares.md), investors can diversify their portfolios more easily. Instead of [investing](../i/investing.md) in a few whole [shares](../s/shares.md) of a single stock, they can spread their investment across [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) and sectors, thus mitigating [risk](../r/risk.md).

3. **Reduced Cash Drag:** Fractional [shares](../s/shares.md) allow for a more efficient use of [capital](../c/capital.md). Investors do not have to leave unused funds sitting in their brokerage accounts when those funds can be fully invested in fractional [shares](../s/shares.md).

4. **Ease of [Reinvestment](../r/reinvestment.md):** [Reinvestment](../r/reinvestment.md) of dividends or leftover funds from sales can be seamlessly directed into purchasing fractional [shares](../s/shares.md), allowing [continuous compounding](../c/continuous_compounding.md) and growth of [invested capital](../i/invested_capital.md).

## Drawbacks of Fractional Shares
While the benefits are numerous, there are some potential downsides to consider when [investing](../i/investing.md) in fractional [shares](../s/shares.md).

1. **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) Issues:** Fractional [shares](../s/shares.md) might not be as [liquid](../l/liquid.md) as whole [shares](../s/shares.md). If an [investor](../i/investor.md) needs to sell fractional [shares](../s/shares.md), it could potentially be more challenging, depending on the policies and [execution](../e/execution.md) capabilities of the brokerage.

2. **Brokerage Dependence:** Fractional [shares](../s/shares.md) are often non-transferable. This means that if an [investor](../i/investor.md) decides to switch brokerage firms, they might need to sell their fractional [shares](../s/shares.md) and reinvest that [money](../m/money.md) through the new [broker](../b/broker.md), potentially incurring [transaction fees](../t/transaction_fees.md).

3. **Complex Pricing:** The price of fractional [shares](../s/shares.md) might differ slightly from the whole share price due to rounding and [broker](../b/broker.md)-specific pricing policies. Investors need to be aware of these potential discrepancies.

4. **Limited Voting Rights:** Companies typically [offer](../o/offer.md) voting rights to shareholders, but these rights might be limited or non-existent for fractional shareholders depending on the company’s policies.

However, investors should remain mindful of the potential drawbacks and ensure that they understand the policies of their brokerage [firm](../f/firm.md) to make informed decisions.

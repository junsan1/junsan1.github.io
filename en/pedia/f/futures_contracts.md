# Futures Contracts

## Introduction

A [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) is a standardized legal agreement to buy or sell a particular [commodity](../c/commodity.md) or [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future. These contracts are traded on [futures](../f/futures.md) exchanges and are used by traders to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against price fluctuations, as well as by speculative investors aiming to [profit](../p/profit.md) from changes in [market](../m/market.md) prices.

## History of Futures Contracts

[Futures](../f/futures.md) contracts have a rich history that dates back to ancient civilizations. The first recorded instances of [futures](../f/futures.md)-like agreements occurred in Mesopotamia around 1750 BC, where farmers contracted to sell their crops at a future date. However, the modern framework for [futures](../f/futures.md) trading began in the 19th century with the establishment of organized exchanges.

The Chicago Board of [Trade](../t/trade.md) (CBOT) was founded in 1848 and is considered the birthplace of the modern [futures market](../f/futures_market.md). Initially, the CBOT provided a centralized marketplace for farmers and merchants to [trade](../t/trade.md) contracts for agricultural commodities such as wheat and corn. Over the years, the [range](../r/range.md) of commodities has expanded to include metals, energy products, and financial instruments.

## Key Features of Futures Contracts

### Standardization

[Futures](../f/futures.md) contracts are highly standardized to facilitate trading on exchanges. Key elements that are standardized include:
- The quantity of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)
- The quality or grade of the [asset](../a/asset.md)
- The delivery location
- The delivery date

### Leverage

[Futures](../f/futures.md) contracts are leveraged instruments, meaning that traders can control a large position with a relatively small [initial margin](../i/initial_margin.md) [deposit](../d/deposit.md). This [leverage](../l/leverage.md) amplifies both potential gains and potential losses, making [futures](../f/futures.md) trading a high-[risk](../r/risk.md), high-reward activity.

### Margin Requirements

To [trade](../t/trade.md) [futures](../f/futures.md) contracts, traders must maintain a [margin account](../m/margin_account.md) with their [broker](../b/broker.md). The [initial margin](../i/initial_margin.md) is a percentage of the contract's [value](../v/value.md) that must be deposited to [open](../o/open.md) a position. There is also a [maintenance margin](../m/maintenance_margin.md), which is the minimum amount that must be maintained in the account to keep the position [open](../o/open.md). If the [account balance](../a/account_balance.md) falls below the [maintenance margin](../m/maintenance_margin.md), a [margin call](../m/margin_call.md) is issued, requiring the [trader](../t/trader.md) to [deposit](../d/deposit.md) additional funds.

### Daily Settlement

[Futures](../f/futures.md) contracts are marked-to-[market](../m/market.md) daily, meaning that any gains or losses are settled at the end of each trading day. This process ensures that [margin](../m/margin.md) requirements are continuously updated based on the current [market value](../m/market_value.md) of the contract.

### Delivery

While many [futures](../f/futures.md) contracts are settled in cash, some require the [physical delivery](../p/physical_delivery_in_trading.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). For instance, a contract for [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md) may require the seller to deliver the specified quantity of oil to a predetermined location on the delivery date.

## Types of Futures Contracts

### Commodity Futures

[Commodity futures](../c/commodity_futures.md) are contracts for the delivery of physical goods such as:
- Agricultural products (e.g., wheat, corn, soybeans)
- Energy products (e.g., [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md), natural gas)
- Metals (e.g., gold, silver, copper)

### Financial Futures

Financial [futures](../f/futures.md) are contracts based on financial instruments and indices. These include:
- [Interest rate futures](../i/interest_rate_futures.md) (e.g., [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) bonds, [Eurodollar](../e/eurodollar.md) deposits)
- Stock [index futures](../i/index_futures.md) (e.g., S&P 500, [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md)-100)
- [Currency](../c/currency.md) [futures](../f/futures.md) (e.g., EUR/USD, GBP/USD)

## Trading Strategies

### Hedging

Hedging involves taking a position in the [futures market](../f/futures_market.md) to [offset](../o/offset.md) potential losses in the [spot market](../s/spot_market.md). For example, a farmer might sell corn [futures](../f/futures.md) to lock in a selling price for their crop, thus protecting against a potential decline in corn prices.

### Speculation

Speculators aim to [profit](../p/profit.md) from price changes by buying and selling [futures](../f/futures.md) contracts without intending to take delivery of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). They rely on [market](../m/market.md) analysis and forecasts to make informed trading decisions.

### Arbitrage

[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) involves simultaneously buying and selling related instruments to [profit](../p/profit.md) from price discrepancies. For instance, a [trader](../t/trader.md) might exploit differences between the [futures](../f/futures.md) price and the [spot price](../s/spot_price.md) of an [asset](../a/asset.md).

## Regulatory Environment

[Futures](../f/futures.md) trading is subject to regulatory oversight to ensure [market](../m/market.md) integrity and protect investors. In the United States, the primary regulatory body is the [Commodity Futures](../c/commodity_futures.md) Trading [Commission](../c/commission.md) (CFTC). The CFTC oversees the activities of [futures](../f/futures.md) exchanges and enforces rules to prevent [market manipulation](../m/market_manipulation.md) and [fraud](../f/fraud.md).

## Major Futures Exchanges

Several major [futures](../f/futures.md) exchanges operate globally, providing a platform for the trading of [futures](../f/futures.md) contracts. Some of the most prominent exchanges include:

- **Chicago Mercantile [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (CME)**: One of the largest and most diverse [futures](../f/futures.md) exchanges, [offering](../o/offering.md) contracts on commodities, financial instruments, and indices. [CME Group](https://www.cmegroup.com)
- **Intercontinental [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (ICE)**: Known for its energy [futures](../f/futures.md) contracts, as well as financial [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md). [Intercontinental Exchange](https://www.theice.com)
- **[Euronext](../e/euronext.md)**: A pan-European [exchange](../e/exchange.md) providing [futures](../f/futures.md) and [options](../o/options.md) contracts on a variety of assets. [Euronext](https://www.euronext.com)
- **Tokyo [Commodity](../c/commodity.md) [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (TOCOM)**: Focuses on commodities such as metals, rubber, and energy products. [TOCOM](https://www.tocom.or.jp)

## Advantages of Futures Contracts

### Price Discovery

The [futures market](../f/futures_market.md) provides a transparent and efficient mechanism for [price discovery](../p/price_discovery.md). [Market](../m/market.md) participants incorporate all available information, leading to fair prices for commodities and financial instruments.

### Liquidity

[Futures](../f/futures.md) markets are highly [liquid](../l/liquid.md), with significant trading volumes and tight [bid](../b/bid.md)-ask [spreads](../s/spreads.md). This [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) allows traders to enter and exit positions easily and at minimal [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md).

### Hedging and Risk Management

[Futures](../f/futures.md) contracts are valuable tools for hedging against price [volatility](../v/volatility.md). They enable producers, consumers, and investors to lock in prices and manage their exposure to [market](../m/market.md) risks.

### Leverage

The use of [leverage](../l/leverage.md) allows traders to control large positions with a relatively small amount of [capital](../c/capital.md). This magnifies potential returns, making [futures](../f/futures.md) trading attractive to speculators.

## Risks of Futures Contracts

### Market Risk

[Futures](../f/futures.md) trading involves substantial [market risk](../m/market_risk.md) due to price [volatility](../v/volatility.md). Prices can move sharply in either direction, leading to significant gains or losses.

### Leverage Risk

While [leverage](../l/leverage.md) can amplify gains, it also increases the potential for large losses. Traders must manage their positions carefully and maintain sufficient [margin](../m/margin.md) to avoid [margin](../m/margin.md) calls.

### Liquidity Risk

In times of [market](../m/market.md) stress, [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) can dry up, making it difficult to exit positions without incurring substantial losses. This is particularly relevant for less actively traded contracts.

### Counterparty Risk

Although [futures](../f/futures.md) exchanges mitigate [counterparty risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md) through their clearinghouses, there is still a small [risk](../r/risk.md) of [default](../d/default.md) by one of the parties involved in the [trade](../t/trade.md).

## Conclusion

[Futures](../f/futures.md) contracts play a crucial role in modern [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), [offering](../o/offering.md) a mechanism for [price discovery](../p/price_discovery.md), [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), and speculative opportunities. Their standardized nature and regulatory oversight ensure a fair and transparent [trading environment](../t/trading_environment.md). However, the significant [leverage](../l/leverage.md) and [market](../m/market.md) risks inherent in [futures](../f/futures.md) trading necessitate careful [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) and a thorough understanding of the [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md).

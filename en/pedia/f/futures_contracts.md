# Futures Contracts

## Introduction

A futures contract is a standardized legal agreement to buy or sell a particular commodity or financial instrument at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future. These contracts are traded on futures exchanges and are used by traders to hedge against price fluctuations, as well as by speculative investors aiming to profit from changes in market prices.

## History of Futures Contracts

Futures contracts have a rich history that dates back to ancient civilizations. The first recorded instances of futures-like agreements occurred in Mesopotamia around 1750 BC, where farmers contracted to sell their crops at a future date. However, the modern framework for futures trading began in the 19th century with the establishment of organized exchanges.

The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) was founded in 1848 and is considered the birthplace of the modern futures market. Initially, the CBOT provided a centralized marketplace for farmers and merchants to trade contracts for agricultural commodities such as wheat and corn. Over the years, the range of commodities has expanded to include metals, energy products, and financial instruments.

## Key Features of Futures Contracts

### Standardization

Futures contracts are highly standardized to facilitate trading on exchanges. Key elements that are standardized include:
- The quantity of the underlying asset
- The quality or grade of the asset
- The delivery location
- The delivery date

### Leverage

Futures contracts are leveraged instruments, meaning that traders can control a large position with a relatively small initial margin deposit. This leverage amplifies both potential gains and potential losses, making futures trading a high-risk, high-reward activity.

### Margin Requirements

To trade futures contracts, traders must maintain a margin account with their broker. The initial margin is a percentage of the contract's value that must be deposited to open a position. There is also a maintenance margin, which is the minimum amount that must be maintained in the account to keep the position open. If the account balance falls below the maintenance margin, a margin call is issued, requiring the trader to deposit additional funds.

### Daily Settlement

Futures contracts are marked-to-market daily, meaning that any gains or losses are settled at the end of each trading day. This process ensures that margin requirements are continuously updated based on the current market value of the contract.

### Delivery

While many futures contracts are settled in cash, some require the physical delivery of the underlying asset. For instance, a contract for crude oil may require the seller to deliver the specified quantity of oil to a predetermined location on the delivery date.

## Types of Futures Contracts

### Commodity Futures

[Commodity futures](../c/commodity_futures.md) are contracts for the delivery of physical goods such as:
- Agricultural products (e.g., wheat, corn, soybeans)
- Energy products (e.g., crude oil, natural gas)
- Metals (e.g., gold, silver, copper)

### Financial Futures

Financial futures are contracts based on financial instruments and indices. These include:
- [Interest rate futures](../i/interest_rate_futures.md) (e.g., U.S. Treasury bonds, Eurodollar deposits)
- Stock [index futures](../i/index_futures.md) (e.g., S&P 500, NASDAQ-100)
- Currency futures (e.g., EUR/USD, GBP/USD)

## Trading Strategies

### Hedging

Hedging involves taking a position in the futures market to offset potential losses in the spot market. For example, a farmer might sell corn futures to lock in a selling price for their crop, thus protecting against a potential decline in corn prices.

### Speculation

Speculators aim to profit from price changes by buying and selling futures contracts without intending to take delivery of the underlying asset. They rely on market analysis and forecasts to make informed trading decisions.

### Arbitrage

[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) involves simultaneously buying and selling related instruments to profit from price discrepancies. For instance, a trader might exploit differences between the futures price and the spot price of an asset.

## Regulatory Environment

Futures trading is subject to regulatory oversight to ensure market integrity and protect investors. In the United States, the primary regulatory body is the [Commodity Futures](../c/commodity_futures.md) Trading Commission (CFTC). The CFTC oversees the activities of futures exchanges and enforces rules to prevent market manipulation and fraud.

## Advantages of Futures Contracts

### Price Discovery

The futures market provides a transparent and efficient mechanism for price discovery. Market participants incorporate all available information, leading to fair prices for commodities and financial instruments.

### Liquidity

Futures markets are highly liquid, with significant trading volumes and tight bid-ask spreads. This liquidity allows traders to enter and exit positions easily and at minimal transaction costs.

### Hedging and Risk Management

Futures contracts are valuable tools for hedging against price volatility. They enable producers, consumers, and investors to lock in prices and manage their exposure to market risks.

### Leverage

The use of leverage allows traders to control large positions with a relatively small amount of capital. This magnifies potential returns, making futures trading attractive to speculators.

## Risks of Futures Contracts

### Market Risk

Futures trading involves substantial market risk due to price volatility. Prices can move sharply in either direction, leading to significant gains or losses.

### Leverage Risk

While leverage can amplify gains, it also increases the potential for large losses. Traders must manage their positions carefully and maintain sufficient margin to avoid margin calls.

### Liquidity Risk

In times of market stress, liquidity can dry up, making it difficult to exit positions without incurring substantial losses. This is particularly relevant for less actively traded contracts.

### Counterparty Risk

Although futures exchanges mitigate [counterparty risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md) through their clearinghouses, there is still a small risk of default by one of the parties involved in the trade.

## Conclusion

Futures contracts play a crucial role in modern financial markets, offering a mechanism for price discovery, [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), and speculative opportunities. Their standardized nature and regulatory oversight ensure a fair and transparent [trading environment](../t/trading_environment.md). However, the significant leverage and market risks inherent in futures trading necessitate careful [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) and a thorough understanding of the market dynamics.

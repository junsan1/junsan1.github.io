# Fully Diluted Shares

## Introduction
Fully diluted [shares](../s/shares.md) represent the total number of [shares](../s/shares.md) that would be outstanding if all possible sources of conversion, such as convertible bonds and employee stock [options](../o/options.md), were exercised. This concept is crucial for investors and analysts to understand the full potential [dilution](../d/dilution.md) of [earnings](../e/earnings.md) per share (EPS) and the impact on ownership percentages. In this document, we [will](../w/will.md) dissect the importance of fully diluted [shares](../s/shares.md), the components involved, and its implications on [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md) and investment decisions.

## Importance of Fully Diluted Shares
Fully diluted [shares](../s/shares.md) provide a more comprehensive picture of a company’s share structure. When looking at basic [shares](../s/shares.md) outstanding, one might miss out on potential diluters which can significantly affect the EPS and [market](../m/market.md) [valuation](../v/valuation.md). By considering fully diluted [shares](../s/shares.md), investors can:

1. **Gauge True Ownership**: It helps current and potential investors understand the maximum possible [shares](../s/shares.md) that could be outstanding, thus giving a clearer picture of potential ownership percentage.
2. **Assess True [Valuation](../v/valuation.md)**: Since EPS is an important metric for valuations, a fully diluted EPS offers a more accurate [valuation](../v/valuation.md) metric.
3. **Make Informed Decisions**: Investors can make better-informed decisions on the potential dilutive impact of financial instruments that can convert into [shares](../s/shares.md).

## Components Contributing to Fully Diluted Shares
To calculate the fully diluted number of [shares](../s/shares.md), one must consider the following components:

### 1. **Basic Shares Outstanding**
This is the total number of [shares](../s/shares.md) that are currently outstanding and available in the [market](../m/market.md). These are the [shares](../s/shares.md) issued minus any treasury [shares](../s/shares.md) held by the company.

### 2. **Stock Options**
Stock [options](../o/options.md) give employees or other stakeholders the right to purchase [common stock](../c/common_stock.md) at a set price. When these [options](../o/options.md) are exercised, they increase the total number of [shares](../s/shares.md) outstanding.

### 3. **Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)**
RSUs represent company stock promised to employees and executives as part of their compensation but are subject to [vesting](../v/vesting.md) conditions. Once these conditions are met, the RSUs convert into [shares](../s/shares.md).

### 4. **Convertible Debt**
Convertible [debt](../d/debt.md) instruments, like convertible bonds, can be converted into a predetermined number of [shares](../s/shares.md). The possibility of conversion adds to the pool of potentially dilutive [shares](../s/shares.md).

### 5. **Warrants**
[Warrants](../w/warrants_in_trading.md) are similar to stock [options](../o/options.md), but they are usually issued to investors. They provide the right to purchase company stock at a specific price before an [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md).

### 6. **Convertible Preferred Stock**
[Preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md) that can be converted into [common stock](../c/common_stock.md) often carries a fixed conversion ratio. These [shares](../s/shares.md) are included in fully diluted [shares](../s/shares.md) if conversion is beneficial to the holder.

## Calculation of Fully Diluted Shares
Calculating fully diluted [shares](../s/shares.md) involves adding the potential dilutive [shares](../s/shares.md) to the current basic [shares](../s/shares.md) outstanding. A common method used is the **[Treasury Stock Method](../t/treasury_stock_method.md)**, particularly for stock [options](../o/options.md) and [warrants](../w/warrants_in_trading.md).

### Treasury Stock Method
The [Treasury Stock Method](../t/treasury_stock_method.md) calculates the number of new [shares](../s/shares.md) that can theoretically be created by exercising in-the-[money](../m/money.md) [options](../o/options.md) and [warrants](../w/warrants_in_trading.md) and uses the resultant proceeds to buy back [shares](../s/shares.md) at the current [market price](../m/market_price.md).

#### Example:
1. **Outstanding Stock [Options](../o/options.md)**: 200,000 with an [exercise price](../e/excersise_price.md) of $50
2. **Current [Market Price](../m/market_price.md)**: $100
3. **Proceeds**: 200,000 * $50 = $10,000,000
4. **[Shares](../s/shares.md) Purchased**: $10,000,000 / $100 = 100,000
5. **Net New [Shares](../s/shares.md)**: 200,000 - 100,000 = 100,000

These 100,000 [shares](../s/shares.md) are added to the basic [shares](../s/shares.md) outstanding to get the fully diluted share count.

## Implications for Earnings Per Share (EPS)
EPS is a crucial measure of a company’s profitability. The basic EPS does not account for potential [dilution](../d/dilution.md):

\[ \text{Basic EPS} = \frac{\text{Net [Income](../i/income.md)}}{\text{Basic [Shares](../s/shares.md) Outstanding}} \]

Fully diluted EPS, on the other hand, includes all potential dilutive [shares](../s/shares.md):

\[ \text{Fully Diluted EPS} = \frac{\text{Net [Income](../i/income.md)}}{\text{Fully Diluted [Shares](../s/shares.md) Outstanding}} \]

For example, if a company with Net [Income](../i/income.md) of $200,000 has 1,000,000 basic [shares](../s/shares.md) and 1,200,000 fully diluted [shares](../s/shares.md):

- Basic EPS = $200,000 / 1,000,000 = $0.20
- Fully Diluted EPS = $200,000 / 1,200,000 = $0.1667

## Real-World Examples of Fully Diluted Shares 
### Example 1: Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)
As of December 31, 2022, Amazon reported having 510 million basic [shares](../s/shares.md) outstanding. The company also has stock [options](../o/options.md), RSUs, and convertible securities that could significantly increase the fully diluted share count. Investors analyze both the basic and fully diluted EPS to assess company performance accurately.

### Example 2: Tesla, Inc. (TSLA)
Tesla's share structure is another example where fully diluted [shares](../s/shares.md) are essential. As of Q4 2022, Tesla has over 1 billion basic [shares](../s/shares.md) outstanding. However, stock [options](../o/options.md) and convertible notes could increase that number, which analysts closely monitor to understand the potential impact on the EPS.

## Tools for Calculating Fully Diluted Shares
Several financial tools and software can help compute fully diluted [shares](../s/shares.md), making it easier for analysts and investors to obtain accurate figures. Some common tools include:

- **[Bloomberg Terminal](../b/bloomberg_terminal.md)**: Provides detailed [stock option](../s/stock_option.md) and convertible securities data.
- **[FactSet](../f/factset.md)**: Comprehensive database for financial analysts to track share counts.
- **[Yahoo Finance](../y/yahoo_finance.md)**: Offers basic data on [shares](../s/shares.md) outstanding but has limitations.

## Conclusion
Fully diluted [shares](../s/shares.md) give a realistic picture of a company’s [equity](../e/equity.md) structure by acknowledging all potential [shares](../s/shares.md) that could dilute the current [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) base. Understanding fully diluted [shares](../s/shares.md) helps investors make better decisions and accurately [value](../v/value.md) companies. By considering stock [options](../o/options.md), [warrants](../w/warrants_in_trading.md), convertible [debt](../d/debt.md), and other forms of potential [dilution](../d/dilution.md), stakeholders can assess the impact on metrics such as EPS and ownership percentages more accurately.

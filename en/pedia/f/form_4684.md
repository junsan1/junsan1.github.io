# Form 4684

## Introduction

Form 4684 is an IRS tax form used by individuals, estates, trusts, and businesses to report losses incurred due to unexpected events such as natural disasters, thefts, or other casualties. These losses can often have significant financial impacts and understanding how to report them on your tax return can help mitigate some of these effects through potential tax deductions.

## Understanding Casualties and Thefts

### Definition of Casualty
A casualty is the damage, destruction, or loss of property resulting from a sudden, unexpected, or unusual event. These can include events such as:
- Natural disasters (hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes)
- Fires
- Floods
- Vandalism
- Terrorist attacks

### Definition of Theft
Theft is defined as the illegal taking and removing of money or property with the intent to deprive the owner of it. To qualify as a theft for tax purposes, the act must be illegal under the law of the state where it occurred and must have been done with criminal intent.

## Completing Form 4684

Form 4684 is divided into two main sections for individuals and a separate section for business or income-producing property.

### Section A: Personal Use Property
This section deals with losses related to personal use property, such as your home, household items, or personal vehicles.

Step-by-Step Guide:
1. **Identifying Information**: Enter your name and social security number.
2. **Description of Property**: Provide a detailed description of the property, including the date of acquisition.
3. **Loss Calculation**: Determine the amount of loss by calculating the decrease in fair market value due to the casualty or theft. This involves:
   - Fair market value before the event.
   - Fair market value after the event.
   - Cost or adjusted basis of the property.
4. **Insurance and Reimbursements**: Deduct any insurance or other reimbursements received.
5. **Net Loss**: Calculate the net loss by subtracting reimbursements from the lower of your property's decrease in fair market value or its adjusted basis.

### Section B: Business and Income-Producing Property
This section is used to report casualties and thefts of property used in a trade or business or held for rental or investment.

Step-by-Step Guide:
1. **Identifying Information**: Enter the business name and Employer Identification Number (EIN) if applicable.
2. **Description of Property**: Describe the property and detail the nature of the loss.
3. **Loss Calculation**: Similar to Section A, calculate the decrease in fair market value or adjusted basis, and deduct any insurance or reimbursements.
4. **Business Losses**: For business property, if the total loss exceeds the property's adjusted basis, the loss should be treated as an ordinary loss.

### Section C: Summary
This section summarizes the total losses from Sections A and B, applying any limitations such as:
- The $100 rule: Each casualty or theft loss must be reduced by $100.
- The 10% rule: Deductible personal casualty and theft losses must be further reduced by 10% of the adjusted gross income (AGI).

### Section D: Gains and Benefits
This section is used to report any gains from involuntary conversion or reimbursements that exceed the original cost or adjusted basis of the property.

## Key Points to Remember
- **Document Everything**: Keep detailed records of the event, including photos, police reports, and insurance claims.
- **Timely Reporting**: Ensure losses are reported in the year they occur, although some exceptions apply in federally declared disaster areas.
- **Professional Advice**: Consider consulting with a tax professional to navigate complex scenarios or substantial losses.

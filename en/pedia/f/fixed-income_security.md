# Fixed-Income Security

A fixed-[income](../i/income.md) [security](../s/security.md) is a type of investment that pays returns in the form of fixed periodic [interest](../i/interest.md) payments and the eventual [return](../r/return.md) of [principal](../p/principal.md) at [maturity](../m/maturity.md). Unlike variable-[return](../r/return.md) [equity](../e/equity.md) investments like [stocks](../s/stock.md), fixed-[income](../i/income.md) securities have predictable [income](../i/income.md) streams and are generally less volatile. This makes them a popular choice for [risk-averse](../r/risk-averse.md) investors seeking steady and reliable returns. This document provides a comprehensive overview of fixed-[income](../i/income.md) securities, discussing various types, their features, benefits, risks, and major players in the [market](../m/market.md).

## Types of Fixed-Income Securities

### Bonds
Bonds are the most common type of fixed-[income](../i/income.md) [security](../s/security.md). When an entity ([issuer](../i/issuer.md)) needs to raise [capital](../c/capital.md), it can [issue](../i/issue.md) bonds, which are essentially loans from investors to the [issuer](../i/issuer.md). The [issuer](../i/issuer.md) pays [interest](../i/interest.md) ([coupon rate](../c/coupon_rate.md)) on the [bond](../b/bond.md) at regular intervals and repays the [principal](../p/principal.md) at the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s [maturity date](../m/maturity_date.md).

#### Treasury Bonds
Issued by the government, treasury bonds are considered one of the safest investments because they are backed by the government's taxing power.

#### Corporate Bonds
Issued by companies to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) for various purposes such as [expansion](../e/expansion.md) or modernization. These bonds typically [offer](../o/offer.md) higher yields than government securities to compensate for the increased [risk](../r/risk.md).

#### Municipal Bonds
Issued by states, municipalities, or counties to [finance](../f/finance.md) public projects. These bonds are often exempt from federal, state, and local [taxes](../t/taxes.md).

### Certificates of Deposit (CDs)
Offered by banks and [credit](../c/credit.md) unions, CDs pay a [fixed interest rate](../f/fixed_interest_rate.md) for a specified term. They are insured by the FDIC up to certain limits, making them a low-[risk](../r/risk.md) investment.

### Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS)
These are investments in a pool of [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) loans. Investors receive periodic payments derived from the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) payments made by homeowners.

### Asset-Backed Securities (ABS)
Similar to MBS, these are backed by other types of loans, such as car loans or [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) receivables.

## Features of Fixed-Income Securities

### Face Value
The [principal](../p/principal.md) amount of the [bond](../b/bond.md) or [security](../s/security.md) that [will](../w/will.md) be paid back to the [investor](../i/investor.md) at [maturity](../m/maturity.md).

### Coupon Rate
The [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) that the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) [will](../w/will.md) pay to the bondholders. This can be fixed or variable.

### Maturity Date
The date on which the [principal](../p/principal.md) amount of a [bond](../b/bond.md) or [security](../s/security.md) is to be paid back to the [investor](../i/investor.md).

### Yield
The [return](../r/return.md) on investment for the [bond](../b/bond.md), calculated as the annual [interest](../i/interest.md) [payment](../p/payment.md) divided by the current [market price](../m/market_price.md) of the [bond](../b/bond.md).

### Duration
A measure of the sensitivity of a [bond](../b/bond.md)'s price to changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. The longer the [duration](../d/duration.md), the more sensitive the [bond](../b/bond.md) is to [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) changes.

## Benefits of Fixed-Income Securities

### Predictable Income
They provide regular and predictable [interest](../i/interest.md) [income](../i/income.md), making them suitable for [income](../i/income.md)-focused investors.

### Capital Preservation
Since fixed-[income](../i/income.md) securities usually repay the [principal](../p/principal.md) at [maturity](../m/maturity.md), they are effective for preserving [capital](../c/capital.md).

### Diversification
Including fixed-[income](../i/income.md) securities in a portfolio can help diversify and reduce overall [risk](../r/risk.md), as they often behave differently from [equity](../e/equity.md) investments.

### Lower Volatility
Fixed-[income](../i/income.md) securities typically experience less price [volatility](../v/volatility.md) compared to [stocks](../s/stock.md), [offering](../o/offering.md) a safer investment option during [market](../m/market.md) downturns.

## Risks Associated with Fixed-Income Securities

### Interest Rate Risk
The [risk](../r/risk.md) that the [value](../v/value.md) of a fixed-[income](../i/income.md) [security](../s/security.md) [will](../w/will.md) decline due to an increase in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. Long-term bonds are especially sensitive to changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

### Credit Risk
The [risk](../r/risk.md) that the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) [will](../w/will.md) [default](../d/default.md) on its [payment](../p/payment.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md). This [risk](../r/risk.md) is higher for corporate bonds and lower for government bonds.

### Inflation Risk
The [risk](../r/risk.md) that [inflation](../i/inflation.md) [will](../w/will.md) erode the [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) of the fixed [interest](../i/interest.md) payments over time.

### Liquidity Risk
The [risk](../r/risk.md) that the [investor](../i/investor.md) [will](../w/will.md) not be able to sell the [security](../s/security.md) quickly without affecting its price significantly.

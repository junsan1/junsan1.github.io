# Fixed-Income Security

A fixed-income security is a type of investment that pays returns in the form of fixed periodic interest payments and the eventual return of principal at maturity. Unlike variable-return equity investments like stocks, fixed-income securities have predictable income streams and are generally less volatile. This makes them a popular choice for risk-averse investors seeking steady and reliable returns. This document provides a comprehensive overview of fixed-income securities, discussing various types, their features, benefits, risks, and major players in the market.

## Types of Fixed-Income Securities

### Bonds
Bonds are the most common type of fixed-income security. When an entity (issuer) needs to raise capital, it can issue bonds, which are essentially loans from investors to the issuer. The issuer pays interest (coupon rate) on the bond at regular intervals and repays the principal at the bond's maturity date.

#### Treasury Bonds
Issued by the government, treasury bonds are considered one of the safest investments because they are backed by the government's taxing power.

#### Corporate Bonds
Issued by companies to raise capital for various purposes such as expansion or modernization. These bonds typically offer higher yields than government securities to compensate for the increased risk.

#### Municipal Bonds
Issued by states, municipalities, or counties to finance public projects. These bonds are often exempt from federal, state, and local taxes.

### Certificates of Deposit (CDs)
Offered by banks and credit unions, CDs pay a fixed interest rate for a specified term. They are insured by the FDIC up to certain limits, making them a low-risk investment.

### Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS)
These are investments in a pool of mortgage loans. Investors receive periodic payments derived from the mortgage payments made by homeowners.

### Asset-Backed Securities (ABS)
Similar to MBS, these are backed by other types of loans, such as car loans or credit card receivables.

## Features of Fixed-Income Securities

### Face Value
The principal amount of the bond or security that will be paid back to the investor at maturity.

### Coupon Rate
The interest rate that the issuer will pay to the bondholders. This can be fixed or variable.

### Maturity Date
The date on which the principal amount of a bond or security is to be paid back to the investor.

### Yield
The return on investment for the bond, calculated as the annual interest payment divided by the current market price of the bond.

### Duration
A measure of the sensitivity of a bond's price to changes in interest rates. The longer the duration, the more sensitive the bond is to interest rate changes.

## Benefits of Fixed-Income Securities

### Predictable Income
They provide regular and predictable interest income, making them suitable for income-focused investors.

### Capital Preservation
Since fixed-income securities usually repay the principal at maturity, they are effective for preserving capital.

### Diversification
Including fixed-income securities in a portfolio can help diversify and reduce overall risk, as they often behave differently from equity investments.

### Lower Volatility
Fixed-income securities typically experience less price volatility compared to stocks, offering a safer investment option during market downturns.

## Risks Associated with Fixed-Income Securities

### Interest Rate Risk
The risk that the value of a fixed-income security will decline due to an increase in interest rates. Long-term bonds are especially sensitive to changes in interest rates.

### Credit Risk
The risk that the issuer will default on its payment obligations. This risk is higher for corporate bonds and lower for government bonds.

### Inflation Risk
The risk that inflation will erode the purchasing power of the fixed interest payments over time.

### Liquidity Risk
The risk that the investor will not be able to sell the security quickly without affecting its price significantly.

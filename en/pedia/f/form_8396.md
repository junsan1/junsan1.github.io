# Form 8396

## Introduction
Form 8396 is an official tax document used by taxpayers in the United States to claim the [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [Interest](../i/interest.md) [Credit](../c/credit.md). This [tax credit](../t/tax_credit.md) is designed to help ease the financial burden for individuals who have taken out a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) to buy their primary residence, particularly for those who have received a [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [Credit](../c/credit.md) Certificate (MCC) from a local or state government agency.

## What is a Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC)?
A [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [Credit](../c/credit.md) Certificate is an instrument issued by a state or local government that provides eligible first-time homebuyers with a non-refundable [federal income](../f/federal_income.md) [tax credit](../t/tax_credit.md). The MCC program, established under the [Tax Reform Act of 1986](../t/tax_reform_act_of_1986.md), is intended to assist lower- and moderate-[income](../i/income.md) households in affording homeownership.

The MCC allows homebuyers to claim a [tax credit](../t/tax_credit.md) for a portion of the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) paid annually. The [credit](../c/credit.md) is typically calculated as a percentage (usually ranging from 20% to 50%) of the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) paid, with the exact percentage determined by the issuing agency. This [tax credit](../t/tax_credit.md) can result in significant savings over the life of the [loan](../l/loan.md).

### Eligibility for an MCC
To qualify for an MCC, the homebuyer must meet certain criteria:
1. **First-time Homebuyer:** The individual cannot have owned a primary residence within the last three years. However, exceptions may apply for certain targeted areas or specific groups, such as veterans.
2. **[Income](../i/income.md) Limits:** The [household income](../h/household_income.md) must not exceed the limit set by the issuing authority, often based on [median](../m/median.md) [income](../i/income.md) levels for the area.
3. **Purchase Price Limits:** The [home](../h/home.md)'s purchase price must be within the limits set by the issuing authority.
4. **[Principal](../p/principal.md) Residence:** The [home](../h/home.md) must be the primary residence of the buyer.

## Purpose and Benefits of Form 8396
Form 8396 allows taxpayers to claim the [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [Interest](../i/interest.md) [Credit](../c/credit.md) on their [federal income](../f/federal_income.md) tax returns. By doing so, eligible homeowners can reduce their overall [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md), thereby increasing their [disposable income](../d/disposable_income.md) and enhancing [home](../h/home.md) affordability.

The benefits of filing Form 8396 include:
1. **[Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md):** Unlike a [deduction](../d/deduction.md), which only reduces [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md), a [tax credit](../t/tax_credit.md) directly reduces the amount of tax owed. This can lead to substantial tax savings.
2. **Refundable [Credit](../c/credit.md):** Though the [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [Interest](../i/interest.md) [Credit](../c/credit.md) is non-refundable, it can be carried forward to future years if it exceeds the current year's [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md).

## Completing Form 8396
To complete Form 8396, taxpayers need to provide specific information about their MCC and [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) paid. The form is divided into several parts:

### Part I: Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC) Information
- **Line 1:** Enter the certificate [credit](../c/credit.md) rate shown on your MCC.
- **Line 2:** Enter the amount of [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) paid for the year.

### Part II: Mortgage Interest Credit
- **Line 3:** Multiply the amount of [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) paid (Line 2) by the certificate [credit](../c/credit.md) rate (Line 1). This gives the amount of [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) [credit](../c/credit.md) for the year.
- **Line 4:** Enter any carryforward of unused [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) [credit](../c/credit.md) from previous years.
- **Line 5:** Add Lines 3 and 4 to calculate the total available [credit](../c/credit.md).
- **Line 6:** Enter the portion of the total [credit](../c/credit.md) that can be used for the current year, based on the [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md) limit. If the [credit](../c/credit.md) exceeds the [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md), the excess can be carried forward.

### Part III: Carryforward of Unused Mortgage Interest Credit
- **Line 7:** Calculate the unused portion of the [credit](../c/credit.md) that can be carried forward to future years.

### Illustration of Form 8396
To illustrate the process, consider a [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) with an MCC that provides a 25% [credit](../c/credit.md) rate. If they paid $8,000 in [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) during the year:
- Line 1: 25%
- Line 2: $8,000
- Line 3: $8,000 x 25% = $2,000 ([Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [Interest](../i/interest.md) [Credit](../c/credit.md))
- Line 4: $0 (Assuming no carryforward from previous years)
- Line 5: $2,000 (Total [credit](../c/credit.md) available)
- Line 6: The actual amount to be claimed this year, limited by [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md).

## Filing Form 8396
Form 8396 should be filed with the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md)'s annual [federal income](../f/federal_income.md) [tax return](../t/tax_return.md) (Form 1040). It is important to keep records of the MCC and [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) payments for documentation purposes.

## Conclusion
Form 8396 is a valuable tool for eligible homeowners looking to reduce their tax burden and make homeownership more affordable. Understanding the correct way to complete and file this form ensures that taxpayers can fully benefit from the [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [Interest](../i/interest.md) [Credit](../c/credit.md), easing the financial challenges of homeownership.

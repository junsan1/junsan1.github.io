# Fisher Transform Indicator

The Fisher Transform is a [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) tool created by John F. Ehlers, who introduced it in his book "Cybernetic Analysis for [Stocks](../s/stock.md) and [Futures](../f/futures.md)" in 2004. This [indicator](../i/indicator.md) aims to convert [asset](../a/asset.md) prices into a Gaussian [normal distribution](../n/normal_distribution_in_trading.md), which results in a [bell curve](../b/bell_curve.md) with most values clustered around the mean and fewer values appearing as you move away from the center. By doing so, the Fisher Transform creates extreme values that make it easier to identify turning points in [market](../m/market.md) prices. In essence, it emphasizes price reversals by accentuating peaks and troughs.

## Concept and Mathematical Background

The Fisher Transform is designed on the [basis](../b/basis.md) of mathematical probability and statistical theory. The core principle involves applying an inverse hyperbolic tangent function (arctanh) to the normalized [asset](../a/asset.md) price or any other input signal. The transformation highlights the [value](../v/value.md)'s extreme points, making it easier to identify turning points that are statistically significant.

### The Formula

The general formula for the Fisher Transform is as follows:

\[ FT = 0.5 \ln \left( \frac{1 + x}{1 - x} \right) \]

Where:
- \( FT \) is the Fisher Transform [value](../v/value.md).
- \( x \) is the normalized [asset](../a/asset.md) price [value](../v/value.md).

### Steps Involved

1. **Normalization**: Convert the [asset](../a/asset.md) price into a [value](../v/value.md) between -1 and 1.
2. **Apply Inverse Hyperbolic Tangent (arctanh)**: Transform the normalized [value](../v/value.md) using the arctanh function.
3. **Resulting Fisher [Value](../v/value.md)**: This produces the Fisher Transform [value](../v/value.md), which tends to exaggerate the rate of change, highlighting the peaks and troughs.

## How It Works

### Normalization

The first step in computing the Fisher Transform involves normalization of the data. Normalization typically uses a moving average or a [range](../r/range.md) of past prices to scale the current [asset](../a/asset.md) price between -1 and 1.

### Transformation

Once the data has been normalized, the Fisher Transform applies the arctanh function, which ensures that most of the transformed values lie within a certain [range](../r/range.md). This transformation is critical because it highlights the [statistical significance](../s/statistical_significance.md) of these values compared to a standard [normal distribution](../n/normal_distribution_in_trading.md).

### Signal Generation

The Fisher Transform is primarily used for generating [trading signals](../t/trading_signals.md), specifically to identify potential price reversals. The transformed values, which are now exaggerated, are plotted over time. The crossing points, peaks, and troughs can be used as [trading signals](../t/trading_signals.md).

### Example of Interpretation

If the Fisher Transform [value](../v/value.md) reaches an extreme high and then reverses direction, it might indicate a potential pricing top. Conversely, if it reaches an extreme low and then shifts upwards, it might signify a price bottom.

## Practical Application in Trading

### Buy and Sell Signals

Traders use the Fisher Transform for various [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), primarily focusing on buy and sell signals:

- **Buy Signal**: When the Fisher Transform crosses up through the zero line or reaches an extreme low and turns upwards.
- **Sell Signal**: When the Fisher Transform crosses down through the zero line or reaches an extreme high and turns downwards.

### Divergence Analysis

Fisher Transform can also be used in [divergence](../d/divergence.md) analysis to spot potential reversals:

- **[Bullish Divergence](../b/bullish_divergence.md)**: When the price makes a lower low, but the Fisher Transform makes a higher low.
- **[Bearish Divergence](../b/bearish_divergence.md)**: When the price makes a higher high, but the Fisher Transform makes a lower high.

### Combining with Other Indicators

Traders often combine the Fisher Transform with other [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicator.md), such as Moving Averages, RSI ([Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md)), and MACD (Moving Average Convergence [Divergence](../d/divergence.md)) to validate the signals and enhance the robustness of their [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md).

## Advantages and Limitations

### Advantages

1. **Clear [Reversal](../r/reversal.md) Signals**: The Fisher Transform is effective in highlighting [market](../m/market.md) turning points.
2. **Emphasis on Extreme Values**: It accentuates the [statistical significance](../s/statistical_significance.md) of price changes.
3. **Versatility**: Can be used in conjunction with other indicators for more confident trading decisions.

### Limitations

1. **[False Signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md)**: Like any technical [indicator](../i/indicator.md), it can give [false signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md), especially in [range](../r/range.md)-bound markets.
2. **Requires Normalization**: Proper normalization is crucial, and incorrect normalization could lead to inaccurate signals.
3. **[Lagging Indicator](../l/lagging_indicator.md)**: It might sometimes lag the actual [market price](../m/market_price.md) action, making it less effective for very fast-moving markets.

## Conclusion

The Fisher Transform [Indicator](../i/indicator.md) is a valuable tool within the realm of [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) and [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md). Its capability to convert price data into a Gaussian [normal distribution](../n/normal_distribution_in_trading.md) helps in identifying significant turning points in [market](../m/market.md) prices. Although it has its limitations, when used correctly and in conjunction with other indicators, it can significantly enhance the effectiveness of a [trader](../t/trader.md)'s strategy.

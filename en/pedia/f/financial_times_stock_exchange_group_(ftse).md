## Methodology and Index Calculation

FTSE indices are calculated using transparent, rules-based methodologies that ensure consistency, accuracy, and objectivity. Key components of the index calculation process include:

### Market Capitalization Weighting

Most FTSE indices are market-cap weighted, meaning constituent stocks are weighted according to their market capitalization. This approach reflects the relative size and importance of each company within the index, providing a realistic measure of market performance.

### Free Float Adjustments

To ensure indices accurately represent investable opportunities, FTSE applies free float adjustments to account for shares that are not readily available for trading. This adjustment excludes shares held by insiders, governments, or strategic investors, focusing on shares available to public investors.

### Regular Reviews and Rebalancing

FTSE indices undergo regular reviews and rebalancing to maintain accuracy and relevance. Quarterly and annual reviews assess constituent eligibility, reweight stocks based on market capitalization changes, and ensure compliance with index rules. This process ensures that indices remain an accurate reflection of the underlying market.

### ESG Integration and Screening

For ESG-focused indices like the FTSE4Good Series, FTSE incorporates rigorous ESG screening criteria to select and weight constituent companies. This involves assessing companies against comprehensive ESG performance metrics, excluding those involved in controversial activities, and rewarding those with strong sustainability practices.

## Impact and Influence on the Financial Market

FTSE indices are widely used by investors, asset managers, and financial institutions to benchmark performance, construct portfolios, and develop investment strategies. The adoption of FTSE indices has significant implications for the financial market:

### Benchmarking and Performance Measurement

Investors use FTSE indices as benchmarks to measure the performance of their portfolios against a representative market standard. Indices like the FTSE 100 or FTSE All-World provide a reference point for assessing investment returns, making it easier to evaluate fund manager performance and make informed investment decisions.

The rise of passive investing has been fueled by the availability of FTSE indices, which serve as the underlying benchmarks for index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

# Floating Rate Notes

Floating Rate Notes (FRNs), also known as floaters, are a type of [bond](../b/bond.md) with variable [interest](../i/interest.md) rates that adjust periodically based on a [reference rate](../r/reference_rate.md). Unlike fixed-rate bonds, where [interest](../i/interest.md) payments remain constant throughout the life of the [bond](../b/bond.md), FRNs [offer](../o/offer.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) rates that fluctuate with changes in [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md) rates, such as LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) or the [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) Bill rate. This feature makes FRNs particularly appealing in environments with fluctuating [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, providing investors with a [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md).

## Key Characteristics of Floating Rate Notes

### 1. **Interest Rate Structure**
FRNs have an [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) structure that is typically comprised of a [reference rate](../r/reference_rate.md) plus a fixed spread. For instance, if a [bond](../b/bond.md)'s terms specify a [reference rate](../r/reference_rate.md) of LIBOR + 1%, and the current [LIBOR rate](../l/libor_rate_analysis.md) is 2%, the [interest](../i/interest.md) [payment](../p/payment.md) rate for the period would be 3%.

### 2. **Reference Rates**
Common reference rates for FRNs include:
   - **LIBOR**: Once the most common [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md), LIBOR is being phased out and replaced by alternative reference rates.
   - **SOFR (Secured Overnight [Financing](../f/financing.md) Rate)**: Increasingly used in the U.S. as a replacement for LIBOR.
   - **EURIBOR ([Euro](../e/euro.md) Interbank Offered Rate)**: Used in the [Eurozone](../e/eurozone.md).
   - **T-Bill Rates**: Rates on [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) bills are also a reference for some FRNs.

### 3. **Adjustment Periods**
The [interest](../i/interest.md) rates on FRNs adjust at regular intervals, commonly quarterly, semi-annually, or annually. The specific adjustment period is determined at issuance and detailed in the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s terms.

### 4. **Callable and Non-Callable Options**
Some FRNs may come with callable option, allowing the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) to repay the [principal](../p/principal.md) before the [maturity date](../m/maturity_date.md). This option provides flexibility to the [issuer](../i/issuer.md), particularly if the [interest](../i/interest.md) rates fall significantly.

### 5. **Maturity Range**
FRNs can have a wide [range](../r/range.md) of maturities, from short-term notes maturing in one year to long-term bonds extending beyond ten years.

## Benefits of Investing in Floating Rate Notes

### 1. **Protection Against Interest Rate Risk**
FRNs provide a [natural hedge](../n/natural_hedge.md) against rising [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. As the [reference rate](../r/reference_rate.md) increases, so do the coupon payments, enhancing returns during periods of rising rates.

### 2. **Low Default Risk**
Many FRNs are issued by reputable entities, including governments and large corporations with high [credit](../c/credit.md) ratings, which implies a lower [default risk](../d/default_risk.md) for investors.

### 3. **Income Stability**
Despite the variation in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, FRNs often provide more stable [income](../i/income.md) compared to other variable-[income](../i/income.md) investments, as they adjust periodically to reflect current [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

### 4. **Diversification**
Including FRNs in an investment portfolio adds [diversification](../d/diversification.md), especially in balancing out fixed-rate bonds that are susceptible to [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) changes.

## Risks Associated with Floating Rate Notes

### 1. **Complexity**
FRNs are sometimes more complex than fixed-rate bonds due to their variable nature. Understanding how the [reference rate](../r/reference_rate.md) changes and its subsequent impact on returns can be challenging for some investors.

### 2. **Credit Risk**
While many FRNs have low [default risk](../d/default_risk.md), not all issuers [hold](../h/hold.md) the same [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md). If the [issuer](../i/issuer.md)’s [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) deteriorates, the [value](../v/value.md) of the FRN may decline.

### 3. **Liquidity Risk**
Certain FRNs may have lower [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) compared to more traditional fixed-rate bonds, potentially making them harder to sell in secondary markets.

## Market Participants in FRNs

### 1. **Issuers**
Issuers of FRNs include:
   - **Governments**: National, state, and local governments often [issue](../i/issue.md) FRNs to [finance](../f/finance.md) projects or manage [debt](../d/debt.md).
   - **Corporations**: Large multinational corporations [issue](../i/issue.md) FRNs to [finance](../f/finance.md) operations or [capital](../c/capital.md) expenditures, as well as to manage [debt](../d/debt.md) portfolios.

### 2. **Investors**
Investors in FRNs typically include:
   - **Institutional Investors**: Pension funds, [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies, mutual funds, and [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds often invest in FRNs to manage [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) exposure.
   - **Retail Investors**: Wealthy individuals seeking to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) risks and diversify their portfolios may also invest in FRNs.

### 3. **Intermediaries**
Financial intermediaries play a crucial role in the FRN [market](../m/market.md):
   - **Banks and Brokerage Firms**: Facilitate the buying and selling of FRNs, provide [market](../m/market.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), and [offer](../o/offer.md) research and analysis.
   - **[Rating](../r/rating.md) Agencies**: Agencies like Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s, and Fitch provide [credit](../c/credit.md) ratings for FRNs, helping investors assess [default risk](../d/default_risk.md).

## Valuation of Floating Rate Notes

### 1. **Present Value of Expected Cash Flows**
The [valuation](../v/valuation.md) involves calculating the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of the expected future cash flows from the FRN, which includes periodic coupon payments and the [principal](../p/principal.md) [repayment](../r/repayment.md) at [maturity](../m/maturity.md).

### 2. **Discount Rate**
Determining the appropriate [discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md) is crucial. The rate often reflects the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate plus a spread for [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) and [liquidity risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md). Given the floating nature, [discount](../d/discount.md) rates may adjust with the [reference rate](../r/reference_rate.md) changes.

### 3. **Market Conditions**
[Market](../m/market.md) [supply](../s/supply.md) and [demand](../d/demand.md) dynamics influence the price of FRNs, with higher [demand](../d/demand.md) potentially driving up prices and vice versa.

## Examples of FRNs

### 1. **U.S. Treasury Floating Rate Notes**
The [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) issues FRNs that are tied to the 13-week Treasury bill rate. More information can be found on the [U.S. Treasury website](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/marketables/frns/frns.htm).

### 2. **Corporate FRNs**
Large multinational corporations such as IBM and General Electric have issued FRNs to manage [financing](../f/financing.md) requirements. Details on specific issuances are often available on companies' [investor relations](../i/investor_relations.md) pages.

### 3. **Euro-denominated FRNs**
Many European financial institutions and governments [issue](../i/issue.md) FRNs tied to EURIBOR. For example, the European Investment [Bank](../b/bank.md) frequently issues such notes, with details available on their [official website](https://www.eib.org/en/investor_relations/index.htm).

## Conclusion

Floating Rate Notes [offer](../o/offer.md) a dynamic investment option that combines the features of fixed and variable [income](../i/income.md) instruments. Their inherent flexibility in adjusting to [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) changes makes them an attractive option in a diversified investment portfolio, particularly in uncertain or rising [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) environments. Understanding their structure, benefits, risks, and [market](../m/market.md) mechanics is essential for potential investors to make informed decisions. By exploring the specific features and [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md) of FRNs, investors can better [leverage](../l/leverage.md) their unique characteristics to enhance [portfolio performance](../p/portfolio_performance.md) and manage [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) risks effectively.

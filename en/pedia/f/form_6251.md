# Form 6251

Form 6251, titled "Alternative Minimum Tax - Individuals", is a tax form used by the Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Service (IRS) in the United States to calculate the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) for individual taxpayers. The AMT was originally designed to ensure that high-[income](../i/income.md) individuals who benefit from various tax advantages still pay a minimum amount of tax. However, it may apply to taxpayers across different [income](../i/income.md) levels depending on specific tax situations. The form is complex and involves several calculations to determine whether a [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) owes the AMT in addition to the regular [income tax](../i/income_tax.md).

## Purpose and History of Form 6251

The Alternative Minimum Tax was introduced in 1969 amid concerns that certain high-[income](../i/income.md) individuals were paying little to no [federal income](../f/federal_income.md) tax due to various deductions, credits, and other preferential tax treatments. Form 6251 was created to address this [issue](../i/issue.md) by recalculating [income tax](../i/income_tax.md) using a broader [income](../i/income.md) base, thus ensuring that a minimum amount of tax is paid. Over the years, many changes have been made to the AMT calculations and exemptions, making the form an intricate aspect of the tax code.

## Structure of Form 6251

Form 6251 consists of [multiple](../m/multiple.md) parts and lines where taxpayers input various types of [income](../i/income.md), adjustments, and preferences. Here's a detailed overview:

### Part I: Alternative Minimum Taxable Income (AMTI)

This section is used to determine the AMTI by starting with the adjusted [gross income](../g/gross_income.md) (AGI) and making several adjustments. Key components include:
- **Adjustments for form-specific instances:** Here, taxpayers make adjustments for items such as [standard deduction](../s/standard_deduction.md) differences, itemized deductions, and other [income](../i/income.md) items not considered under AMTI rules.
- **Preferences:** These are specific items that need to be added back to the [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md), which mainly includes [tax-exempt interest](../t/tax-exempt_interest.md) from private activity bonds and certain [depletion](../d/depletion.md) deductions.

### Part II: Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)

This part calculates the tentative AMT and compares it with the regular [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md) to determine any additional tax owed. Main steps include:
- **[Exemption](../e/exemption.md) Amount:** The AMT allows for an [exemption](../e/exemption.md) amount based on [filing status](../f/filing_status.md), which phases out at higher [income](../i/income.md) levels.
- **AMT Rate Application:** The [income](../i/income.md) above the [exemption](../e/exemption.md) is taxed at AMT rates (26% or 28%), depending on the AMTI amount.

### Part III: Tax Computations

Combines regular tax with any AMT [liability](../l/liability.md) and carries over any unused minimum tax from prior years. Here, taxpayers:
- **Compute Tentative Minimum Tax (TMT):** This involves applying AMT rates to AMTI.
- **Compare with Regular Tax:** The final step where the regular tax is subtracted from TMT to determine if AMT applies and the additional tax owed.

## Key Terms and Concepts

### Alternative Minimum Taxable Income (AMTI)

AMTI is the [income](../i/income.md) upon which the AMT is calculated. It starts with AGI and incorporates adjustments and preference items.

### Exemption

The AMT provides a set [exemption](../e/exemption.md) amount that depends on the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md)'s [filing status](../f/filing_status.md) (e.g., single, [married filing jointly](../m/married_filing_jointly.md)). The [exemption](../e/exemption.md) amount phases out at higher [income](../i/income.md) levels.

### AMT Rates

AMT rates are 26% on the first portion of excess AMTI and 28% on [income](../i/income.md) above a specific threshold, which is indexed annually for [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

### Adjustments and Preferences

These adjustments and preferences add back certain deductions and [income](../i/income.md) that are treated more favorably under the regular tax system but are disallowed or limited under AMT calculations. Examples include:
- [Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) differences
- Incentive stock [options](../o/options.md)
- [Tax-exempt interest](../t/tax-exempt_interest.md) on specific private activity bonds

## Practical Considerations

### Who Needs to File Form 6251?

Not all taxpayers need to file Form 6251. Generally, individuals who claim a high number of deductions, [capital](../c/capital.md) gains, or [income](../i/income.md) from particular sources (e.g., [municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md)) might be required to complete this form. A [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) typically completes a worksheet provided in the instructions for Form 1040 or 1040-SR to determine if filing Form 6251 is necessary.

### Public Awareness

The number of taxpayers subject to AMT has historically fluctuated. Legislative measures and [inflation](../i/inflation.md) adjustments often change the [scope](../s/scope.md) of who might be impacted. For instance, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 significantly reduced the number of individuals subject to AMT by increasing the [exemption](../e/exemption.md) amounts and raising the phase-out thresholds.

### Planning and Prevention

[Tax planning](../t/tax_planning.md) is crucial for potentially affected individuals. Strategies involve timing the realization of [income](../i/income.md) and deductions to maneuver within years of higher or lower AMT impact. Consulting tax professionals and utilizing tax software that can preview AMT [liability](../l/liability.md) are common steps taken.

## Submitting Form 6251

### Electronic and Paper Filing

Taxpayers can file Form 6251 both electronically and in paper format. Many taxpayers opt to [use tax](../u/use_tax.md)-preparation software that automatically integrates Form 6251 computations and submissions with the rest of their [tax return](../t/tax_return.md).

### Corrections and Amendments

If errors are identified after filing, individuals may need to file an amended [tax return](../t/tax_return.md) using Form 1040-X, including corrected Form 6251 details. It's essential to keep detailed records and backup documentation, as the IRS may request it to verify calculations.

## Conclusion

Form 6251 is a crucial aspect of U.S. tax compliance for individuals who must calculate and potentially pay the Alternative Minimum Tax. Its complexity arises from the various adjustments, preferences, and calculations required to ensure accurate filings. Understanding and correctly completing Form 6251 can significantly impact a [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md)'s overall [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md).

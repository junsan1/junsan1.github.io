# Fixed Asset

A fixed [asset](../a/asset.md), often referred to in [accounting](../a/accounting.md) as property, plant, and equipment (PP&E), is a long-term tangible piece of property or equipment that a [firm](../f/firm.md) owns and uses in its operations to generate [income](../i/income.md). Unlike [current assets](../c/current_assets.md) like cash or [inventory](../i/inventory.md), fixed assets are expected to be utilized over [multiple](../m/multiple.md) periods, providing lasting [value](../v/value.md) to the [business](../b/business.md). 

## Key Characteristics

### Tangibility
Fixed assets are physical and tangible in nature. They can include things like buildings, machinery, vehicles, office furniture, and computer equipment.

### Longevity
Fixed assets have a [useful life](../u/useful_life.md) that extends beyond a single [accounting](../a/accounting.md) period and usually beyond one year. They are not intended for immediate [sale](../s/sale.md) but for long-term use. 

### Depreciation
Fixed assets undergo [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md), a method to allocate the cost of a tangible [asset](../a/asset.md) over its [useful life](../u/useful_life.md). [Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) helps match the [expense](../e/expense.md) of using the [asset](../a/asset.md) with the [revenue](../r/revenue.md) it generates.

### Capitalized Costs
When a fixed [asset](../a/asset.md) is acquired, its cost is capitalized and then systematically expensed over the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s [useful life](../u/useful_life.md). This [capitalization](../c/capitalization.md) includes not just the purchase price but any additional costs necessary to prepare the [asset](../a/asset.md) for its intended use.

## Types of Fixed Assets

### Land and Buildings
These are often considered as two separate categories because land is not depreciated while buildings are. The [value](../v/value.md) of land remains intact over time, whereas buildings depreciate due to wear and tear.

### Machinery and Equipment
This category includes [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) equipment, tools, and heavy machinery. The cost of maintenance and repairs for these items is substantial, but still necessary to keep them operating efficiently.

### Vehicles
Delivery trucks, company cars, and other transportation equipment fall into this category. [Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) and operating costs are significant factors in managing vehicle assets.

### Office Furniture and Fixtures
Items such as desks, chairs, lighting, and other fixtures that furnish an office are considered fixed assets due to their long-term usage.

### Computers and IT Equipment
Given today's reliance on technology, computers, servers, and other IT equipment are important fixed assets. With the rapid pace of technological advancement, these assets may depreciate more quickly.

## Accounting for Fixed Assets

### Acquisition
When a fixed [asset](../a/asset.md) is purchased, its cost is added to the company's [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) as a capitalized [asset](../a/asset.md) rather than an immediate [expense](../e/expense.md).

### Depreciation Methods
There are several methods for depreciating fixed assets:

- **Straight-Line [Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md)**: Costs are spread evenly over the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s [useful life](../u/useful_life.md).
- **Declining Balance**: Larger [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) expenses are recognized in the earlier years of the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s use.
- **Units of Production**: [Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) is based on the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s usage or output.

### Impairment
If a fixed [asset](../a/asset.md)'s [market value](../m/market_value.md) drops significantly and it is no longer expected to recover, the [asset](../a/asset.md) is said to be impaired. Companies must periodically assess assets for [impairment](../i/impairment.md) and adjust their [book value](../b/book_value.md) accordingly.

### Disposal
When a fixed [asset](../a/asset.md) is no longer in use, it may be sold, scrapped, or otherwise disposed of. The [asset](../a/asset.md)'s [book value](../b/book_value.md) is removed from the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md), and any [gain](../g/gain.md) or loss is recognized.

## Importance in Business

### Operational Efficiency
Fixed assets are crucial for [operational efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md). For [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) companies, machinery and equipment directly impact production capabilities. For service-oriented firms, computers and office equipment are vital for day-to-day operations.

### Financial Health
A company's fixed assets are a major component of its overall [net worth](../n/net_worth.md). They represent significant investments and are often used as [collateral](../c/collateral.md) for loans or other [financing](../f/financing.md).

### Tax Implications
[Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) of fixed assets offers tax benefits by reducing [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md). Different jurisdictions may have varying rules on how [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) is to be calculated and reported.

### Risk Management
Proper management of fixed assets, including maintenance and regular assessment, helps mitigate operational risks associated with [asset](../a/asset.md) failures or impairments.

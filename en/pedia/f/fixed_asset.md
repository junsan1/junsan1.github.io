# Fixed Asset

A fixed asset, often referred to in accounting as property, plant, and equipment (PP&E), is a long-term tangible piece of property or equipment that a firm owns and uses in its operations to generate income. Unlike current assets like cash or inventory, fixed assets are expected to be utilized over multiple periods, providing lasting value to the business. 

## Key Characteristics

### Tangibility
Fixed assets are physical and tangible in nature. They can include things like buildings, machinery, vehicles, office furniture, and computer equipment.

### Longevity
Fixed assets have a useful life that extends beyond a single accounting period and usually beyond one year. They are not intended for immediate sale but for long-term use. 

### Depreciation
Fixed assets undergo depreciation, a method to allocate the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life. Depreciation helps match the expense of using the asset with the revenue it generates.

### Capitalized Costs
When a fixed asset is acquired, its cost is capitalized and then systematically expensed over the asset's useful life. This capitalization includes not just the purchase price but any additional costs necessary to prepare the asset for its intended use.

## Types of Fixed Assets

### Land and Buildings
These are often considered as two separate categories because land is not depreciated while buildings are. The value of land remains intact over time, whereas buildings depreciate due to wear and tear.

### Machinery and Equipment
This category includes manufacturing equipment, tools, and heavy machinery. The cost of maintenance and repairs for these items is substantial, but still necessary to keep them operating efficiently.

### Vehicles
Delivery trucks, company cars, and other transportation equipment fall into this category. Depreciation and operating costs are significant factors in managing vehicle assets.

### Office Furniture and Fixtures
Items such as desks, chairs, lighting, and other fixtures that furnish an office are considered fixed assets due to their long-term usage.

### Computers and IT Equipment
Given today's reliance on technology, computers, servers, and other IT equipment are important fixed assets. With the rapid pace of technological advancement, these assets may depreciate more quickly.

## Accounting for Fixed Assets

### Acquisition
When a fixed asset is purchased, its cost is added to the company's balance sheet as a capitalized asset rather than an immediate expense.

### Depreciation Methods
There are several methods for depreciating fixed assets:

- **Straight-Line Depreciation**: Costs are spread evenly over the asset's useful life.
- **Declining Balance**: Larger depreciation expenses are recognized in the earlier years of the asset's use.
- **Units of Production**: Depreciation is based on the asset's usage or output.

### Impairment
If a fixed asset's market value drops significantly and it is no longer expected to recover, the asset is said to be impaired. Companies must periodically assess assets for impairment and adjust their book value accordingly.

### Disposal
When a fixed asset is no longer in use, it may be sold, scrapped, or otherwise disposed of. The asset's book value is removed from the balance sheet, and any gain or loss is recognized.

## Importance in Business

### Operational Efficiency
Fixed assets are crucial for operational efficiency. For manufacturing companies, machinery and equipment directly impact production capabilities. For service-oriented firms, computers and office equipment are vital for day-to-day operations.

### Financial Health
A company's fixed assets are a major component of its overall net worth. They represent significant investments and are often used as collateral for loans or other financing.

### Tax Implications
Depreciation of fixed assets offers tax benefits by reducing taxable income. Different jurisdictions may have varying rules on how depreciation is to be calculated and reported.

### Risk Management
Proper management of fixed assets, including maintenance and regular assessment, helps mitigate operational risks associated with asset failures or impairments.

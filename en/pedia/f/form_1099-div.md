# Form 1099-DIV

Form 1099-DIV, Dividends and Distributions, is an IRS tax form used by banks and other financial institutions to report dividends and other distributions to taxpayers and the IRS. This form is used to declare the amount of dividends, including any qualified dividends and foreign tax paid on dividends.

## Overview

Form 1099-DIV is crucial for taxpayers who have [investment income](../i/investment_income.md) from [stocks](../s/stock.md), mutual funds, or other entities that pay dividends. The form summarizes various types of distributions that shareholders receive from their investments during a tax year. 

### Key Sections of Form 1099-DIV

Form 1099-DIV is divided into several key sections that report different types of [income](../i/income.md) and other relevant information:

- **Box 1a**: Total [ordinary dividends](../o/ordinary_dividends.md). Includes the total amount of dividends that are not qualified dividends, [interest](../i/interest.md) from some government or corporate bonds, and other [income](../i/income.md) [listed](../l/listed.md) as dividends.
- **Box 1b**: Qualified dividends. A portion of the amount in Box 1a that is eligible for [capital gains tax](../c/capital_gains_tax.md) rates if the [holding period](../h/holding_period.md) requirements are met.
- **Box 2a**: Total [capital gain](../c/capital_gain.md) distributions. Distributions that are paid out of [capital](../c/capital.md) gains.

- **Box 2c**: Section 1202 [gain](../g/gain.md). [Gain](../g/gain.md) from the [sale](../s/sale.md) of qualified small [business](../b/business.md) stock, which may be eligible for a 50%, 75%, or 100% exclusion.

- **Box 4**: [Federal income](../f/federal_income.md) tax withheld. If [federal income](../f/federal_income.md) tax was withheld from the [dividend](../d/dividend.md) [income](../i/income.md), this amount is reported.

### Importance for Investors

Investors need to report the information provided on Form 1099-DIV on their tax returns. Failure to do so can result in underpayment penalties and [interest](../i/interest.md). Proper reporting ensures that taxpayers are compliant with IRS regulations and avoid potential legal issues.

### Filing Requirements

Financial institutions, mutual funds, corporations, or any entity paying dividends of $10 or more during a tax year are required to file Form 1099-DIV and send a copy to the recipient of the [dividend](../d/dividend.md) and the IRS. The form must be sent to the recipients by January 31st of the following tax year and filed with the IRS by the last day of February if filing by paper or the last day of March if filing electronically.

### Electronic Filing

Form 1099-DIV can be filed electronically using the IRS FIRE (Filing Information Returns Electronically) system. Electronic filing is mandatory for filers who are submitting 250 or more forms.

### Record Keeping

Recipients of Form 1099-DIV should retain the forms for at least three years as part of their tax records. These records can provide proof of [income](../i/income.md) and [taxes](../t/taxes.md) paid or withheld and are essential for any future audits or inquiries from the IRS.

### Common Mistakes

- **Incorrect or Missing Information**: Ensure that all personal information and amounts are correct.
- **Not Reporting Foreign [Taxes](../t/taxes.md) Paid**: Many investors overlook reporting foreign [taxes](../t/taxes.md) paid, which can result in a [tax credit](../t/tax_credit.md).
- **Incorrectly Reporting Nondividend Distributions**: These should not be reported as [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md) until they exceed the investment [basis](../b/basis.md).
- **Misidentifying Qualified Dividends**: It is crucial to differentiate between [ordinary dividends](../o/ordinary_dividends.md) and qualified dividends for the preferential [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md).

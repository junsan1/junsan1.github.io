# Foreign Tax Credit

The Foreign [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md) (FTC) is a vital component of international [taxation](../t/taxation.md) that helps mitigate the impact of [double taxation](../d/double_taxation.md) on individuals and entities that earn [income](../i/income.md) from foreign sources. [Double taxation](../d/double_taxation.md) occurs when the same [income](../i/income.md) is taxed by more than one country. To alleviate this burden, the FTC allows taxpayers to claim a [tax credit](../t/tax_credit.md) for the [taxes](../t/taxes.md) paid to foreign governments, thereby reducing their U.S. [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md). This in-depth analysis explores the fundamentals, eligibility criteria, limitations, computation methods, and strategic utilization of the Foreign [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md).

## Fundamentals of Foreign Tax Credit

The FTC is governed by the U.S. Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Code (IRC) and is designed to prevent [double taxation](../d/double_taxation.md) on [income](../i/income.md) that is sourced from foreign countries. The [credit](../c/credit.md) system ensures that individuals or corporations do not pay tax twice on the same [income](../i/income.md), once to the foreign government and once to the U.S. federal government.

## Eligibility for Foreign Tax Credit

To be eligible for a Foreign [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md), the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) must meet specific criteria:

1. **Foreign Tax Paid or Accrued**: The [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) must have paid or accrued foreign tax. The tax must be a legal and actual foreign [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md).
2. **[Income Tax](../i/income_tax.md) or Tax in Lieu of [Income Tax](../i/income_tax.md)**: The foreign tax paid must be an [income tax](../i/income_tax.md) or a tax in lieu of [income tax](../i/income_tax.md). [Taxes](../t/taxes.md) that are not considered [income](../i/income.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) (e.g., [sales tax](../s/sales_tax.md) or [value](../v/value.md)-added tax) do not qualify for the FTC.
3. **Source of [Income](../i/income.md)**: The [income](../i/income.md) on which the foreign tax is paid must be foreign-sourced.
4. **No Refundable [Credit](../c/credit.md)**: Only non-refundable credits are allowed under the FTC provisions.

## Types of Foreign Taxes that Qualify

1. **[Income](../i/income.md) [Taxes](../t/taxes.md)**: Foreign [income](../i/income.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) paid on wages, salaries, dividends, [interest](../i/interest.md), rents, royalties, and other forms of [income](../i/income.md).
2. **[Taxes](../t/taxes.md) in Lieu of [Income](../i/income.md) [Taxes](../t/taxes.md)**: Certain [taxes](../t/taxes.md) that are not formally classified as [income](../i/income.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) but are imposed as substitutes.
3. **Accrued [Taxes](../t/taxes.md)**: [Taxes](../t/taxes.md) that are accrued, even if they are not paid during the tax year but are recognized as liabilities.

## Limitations and Calculation

The Foreign [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md) is subject to limitations to ensure fairness and to align with the [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) Department's policies. The primary limitation is known as the **Foreign [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md) Limitation**, which caps the amount of [credit](../c/credit.md) that can be claimed.

### **Calculating the FTC Limitation**

The FTC Limitation is calculated using the following formula:

\[ \text{Foreign Tax Credit Limitation} = \frac{\text{Foreign Source [Taxable Income](../t/taxable_income.md)}}{\text{Worldwide [Taxable Income](../t/taxable_income.md)}} \times \text{U.S. [Tax Liability](../t/tax_liability.md)} \]

### Components of the Limitation

1. **Foreign Source [Taxable Income](../t/taxable_income.md)**: The portion of the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md)'s total [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md) that is derived from foreign sources.
2. **Worldwide [Taxable Income](../t/taxable_income.md)**: The [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md)'s total [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md), including both U.S. and foreign sources.
3. **U.S. [Tax Liability](../t/tax_liability.md)**: The total amount of tax owed to the U.S. federal government before the application of credits.

### Carryback and Carryforward Provisions

If the Foreign [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md) exceeds the limitation in a given year, the excess [credit](../c/credit.md) can be carried back one year and carried forward for up to ten years.

### Example

Suppose a [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) has:
- $100,000 of total [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md), with $20,000 from foreign sources.
- A U.S. [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md) of $25,000 before any credits.
- Paid $5,000 in foreign [taxes](../t/taxes.md).

The Foreign [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md) Limitation is computed as follows:
\[ \text{FTC Limitation} = \frac{20,000}{100,000} \times 25,000 = 0.2 \times 25,000 = 5,000 \]

Since the foreign [taxes](../t/taxes.md) paid ($5,000) do not exceed the FTC limitation, the entire $5,000 can be claimed as a [credit](../c/credit.md).

## Strategic Utilization of FTC

### Maintaining Detailed Records

Taxpayers must maintain detailed records of all foreign [income](../i/income.md) and [taxes](../t/taxes.md) paid. This includes:
- Foreign tax returns
- [Receipts](../r/receipt.md) and vouchers for [taxes](../t/taxes.md) paid
- Statements of foreign [income](../i/income.md)

### Consulting Tax Professionals

Given the complexity of international tax laws and the FTC, it is advisable to consult with tax professionals who specialize in international [taxation](../t/taxation.md) to ensure optimal utilization and compliance.

### Timing of Tax Payments

Strategic timing of the [payment](../p/payment.md) of foreign [taxes](../t/taxes.md) and the recognition of [income](../i/income.md) can impact the FTC. Advanced planning and coordination with foreign tax authorities can enhance the benefits of the [credit](../c/credit.md).

### Claiming FTC on Tax Returns

To claim the FTC, taxpayers must file IRS Form 1116 (for individuals) or Form 1118 (for corporations). These forms require detailed information about the foreign [income](../i/income.md) and [taxes](../t/taxes.md) and must be attached to the U.S. [tax return](../t/tax_return.md).

### Avoiding Double Tax Agreements

Double Tax Agreements (DTAs) between the U.S. and foreign countries can impact the FTC. These agreements, also known as tax treaties, may [offer](../o/offer.md) alternative relief measures, such as exemptions or reductions in foreign tax rates.

### Utilizing Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE)

Taxpayers who qualify for the [Foreign Earned Income Exclusion](../f/foreign_earned_income_exclusion.md) may exclude a portion of their foreign [earned income](../e/earned_income.md) from U.S. [taxation](../t/taxation.md). However, utilizing the FEIE can affect the FTC calculation, as excluded [income](../i/income.md) reduces the foreign source [income](../i/income.md) used in the limitation formula.

## Advanced Topics in Foreign Tax Credit

### Foreign Subsidiary and Controlled Foreign Corporations (CFCs)

Corporations with foreign subsidiaries or those defined as Controlled Foreign Corporations (CFCs) face additional complexities in FTC calculations. Subpart F [income](../i/income.md) and Global Intangible Low-Taxed [Income](../i/income.md) (GILTI) are taxed currently, and specific rules apply to the FTC calculations for these types of [income](../i/income.md).

### Participation Exemption and FTC

Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the U.S. introduced a participation [exemption](../e/exemption.md) system. It allows U.S. corporations to exclude dividends received from foreign subsidiaries, known as the Section 245A [deduction](../d/deduction.md). However, the inclusion of this [provision](../p/provision.md) also requires adjustments to FTC calculations.

### FTC in Different Tax Jurisdictions

Various countries have different tax systems that complicate the application of the FTC. Differences in tax rates, types of [taxes](../t/taxes.md), and tax treaties all play a role in determining the appropriate [credit](../c/credit.md).

### Foreign Tax Redeterminations

Situations where the foreign tax paid is adjusted or modified after the original FTC claim require taxpayers to recompute and potentially amend their U.S. tax returns. Such scenarios, known as foreign tax redeterminations, involve reporting the changes to the IRS.

### Impact of Exchange Rates

As foreign [income](../i/income.md) and [taxes](../t/taxes.md) are denominated in foreign currencies, fluctuations in [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates can affect the FTC. Taxpayers must use the appropriate [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) to compute the U.S. equivalent of foreign [taxes](../t/taxes.md) paid.

## Online Resources and Tax Software

Several online resources and tax [software tools](../s/software_tools_for_trading.md) are available to assist taxpayers in calculating and claiming the FTC. These tools streamline the process and ensure that computations are accurate and in compliance with IRS regulations.

### IRS Website

The IRS website provides extensive information and resources, including instructions, forms, and publications related to the Foreign [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md).

## Conclusion

The Foreign [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md) is an essential mechanism for reducing the [double taxation](../d/double_taxation.md) burden on U.S. taxpayers with foreign [income](../i/income.md). By understanding the eligibility criteria, computation methods, limitations, and strategic opportunities associated with the FTC, taxpayers can effectively manage their international tax [obligations](../o/obligation.md). Proper planning, detailed record-keeping, and professional [guidance](../g/guidance.md) are crucial in maximizing the benefits of the Foreign [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md) and ensuring compliance with U.S. tax laws.

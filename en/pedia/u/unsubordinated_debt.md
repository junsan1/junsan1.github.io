# Unsubordinated Debt

Unsubordinated [debt](../d/debt.md), also known as senior [debt](../d/debt.md), refers to loans or securities that have a higher claim on the assets and [earnings](../e/earnings.md) of the borrower than subordinated or [junior debt](../j/junior_debt.md). This type of [debt](../d/debt.md) is considered less risky than [subordinated debt](../s/subordinated_debt.md) because it is prioritized for [repayment](../r/repayment.md) if the issuing entity goes bankrupt or is liquidated.

## Characteristics of Unsubordinated Debt

### Priority in Repayment
The key characteristic of unsubordinated [debt](../d/debt.md) is its priority in [repayment](../r/repayment.md). In the event of [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) or [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md), holders of unsubordinated [debt](../d/debt.md) are paid out before [subordinated debt](../s/subordinated_debt.md) holders and [equity](../e/equity.md) investors. This means that if an entity is unable to fulfill all its [debt](../d/debt.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md), unsubordinated [debt](../d/debt.md) holders have a higher chance of recouping their investments.

### Lower Interest Rates
Because unsubordinated [debt](../d/debt.md) is less risky than [subordinated debt](../s/subordinated_debt.md), it generally carries lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. The lower [risk](../r/risk.md) provides a higher likelihood of [repayment](../r/repayment.md), thus requiring issuers to [offer](../o/offer.md) less incentive to attract investors.

### Legal Safeguards
Unsubordinated [debt](../d/debt.md) often comes with specific covenants and terms that protect the interests of the lenders. These legal safeguards can include clauses that prevent the borrower from engaging in activities that could jeopardize their ability to repay the [loan](../l/loan.md).

### Collateralization
Unsubordinated [debt](../d/debt.md) may be secured or unsecured. Secured unsubordinated [debt](../d/debt.md) is backed by [collateral](../c/collateral.md)—[real estate](../r/real_estate.md), equipment, or other valuable assets—which further reduces the [risk](../r/risk.md) to the [lender](../l/lender.md). In the case of [default](../d/default.md), the [lender](../l/lender.md) can seize the pledged assets to recover the owed amount.

### Duration and Maturity
Unsubordinated [debt](../d/debt.md) can have various durations and maturities, from short-term instruments like [commercial paper](../c/commercial_paper.md) or lines of [credit](../c/credit.md) to long-term instruments like bonds. The [duration](../d/duration.md) and [maturity](../m/maturity.md) depend on the needs of the borrower and the appetite of the [lender](../l/lender.md).

## Examples of Unsubordinated Debt

### Corporate Bonds
Corporate bonds are a common form of unsubordinated [debt](../d/debt.md). When a [corporation](../c/corporation.md) issues bonds, they promise to pay back the [principal](../p/principal.md) amount on a specified [maturity date](../m/maturity_date.md) and make periodic [interest](../i/interest.md) payments to bondholders. Corporate bonds are attractive to investors due to their seniority in claim over other types of [debt](../d/debt.md).

### Senior Loans
Banks and financial institutions often provide senior loans to corporations. These loans usually come with strict terms and covenants and are repaid before any junior loans.

### Government Bonds
Government bonds, particularly those issued by stable and developed countries, are typically considered unsubordinated [debt](../d/debt.md). These bonds are backed by the taxing power of the issuing government, making them low-[risk](../r/risk.md) instruments.

## Comparison with Subordinated Debt

### Claim on Assets
- **Unsubordinated [Debt](../d/debt.md)**: Higher claim on assets.
- **[Subordinated Debt](../s/subordinated_debt.md)**: Lower claim on assets; paid after unsubordinated [debt](../d/debt.md).

### Risk and Return
- **Unsubordinated [Debt](../d/debt.md)**: Lower [risk](../r/risk.md), lower [return](../r/return.md).
- **[Subordinated Debt](../s/subordinated_debt.md)**: Higher [risk](../r/risk.md), higher [return](../r/return.md).

### Interest Rates
- **Unsubordinated [Debt](../d/debt.md)**: Lower.
- **[Subordinated Debt](../s/subordinated_debt.md)**: Higher.

### Repayment Priority
- **Unsubordinated [Debt](../d/debt.md)**: First in line after administrative and [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md) costs.
- **[Subordinated Debt](../s/subordinated_debt.md)**: Only after unsubordinated debts have been paid in full.

## Importance in Financial Markets

### Risk Management
Investors use unsubordinated [debt](../d/debt.md) to manage [risk](../r/risk.md) within a diversified portfolio. Even though returns are generally lower than those of [subordinated debt](../s/subordinated_debt.md) or equities, the reduced [risk](../r/risk.md) of [default](../d/default.md) offers a level of [security](../s/security.md).

### Capital Structure
Companies design their [capital](../c/capital.md) structures to balance [debt](../d/debt.md) and [equity](../e/equity.md). By issuing unsubordinated [debt](../d/debt.md), companies can secure funding at lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates due to the lower [risk](../r/risk.md) for lenders. This is often part of a holistic strategy to optimize the overall [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md).

### Market Perception
Ratings agencies and [market](../m/market.md) analysts often assess the amount and structure of a company’s unsubordinated [debt](../d/debt.md) as part of their [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) process. High levels of unsubordinated [debt](../d/debt.md) relative to [equity](../e/equity.md) and [subordinated debt](../s/subordinated_debt.md) can indicate lower [financial risk](../f/financial_risk.md), thereby positively influencing [credit](../c/credit.md) scores and stock prices.

## Key Players in Unsubordinated Debt Markets

### Investment Banks
[Investment banks](../i/investment_bank_(ib).md) play a crucial role in structuring and distributing unsubordinated [debt](../d/debt.md) instruments. They underwrite corporate bonds and facilitate loans to ensure corporations can access necessary funding.

### Asset Managers
[Asset](../a/asset.md) managers incorporate unsubordinated [debt](../d/debt.md) into portfolios to achieve specific [risk](../r/risk.md)-[return](../r/return.md) profiles for their clients. Some might focus on investment-grade corporate bonds, while others may diversify into government bonds and other secure lending instruments.

### Insurance Companies
[Insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies are significant investors in unsubordinated [debt](../d/debt.md), particularly long-term instruments like corporate and government bonds. These investments help them manage actuarial risks and meet [long-term liabilities](../l/long-term_liabilities.md).

## Pros and Cons of Investing in Unsubordinated Debt

### Pros

1. **Lower [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: Lower likelihood of [default](../d/default.md) compared to [subordinated debt](../s/subordinated_debt.md) and equities.
2. **Predictable [Income](../i/income.md)**: Fixed [interest](../i/interest.md) payments provide stable and predictable cash inflow.
3. **Priority in [Repayment](../r/repayment.md)**: Higher claim on assets in case of [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md).

### Cons

1. **Lower Returns**: Reduced returns due to lower [risk](../r/risk.md) profile.
2. **[Interest Rate Sensitivity](../i/interest_rate_sensitivity.md)**: [Bond](../b/bond.md) prices can be adversely affected by rising [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.
3. **[Credit Risk](../c/credit_risk.md)**: Although lower, there is still a [risk](../r/risk.md) of [default](../d/default.md).

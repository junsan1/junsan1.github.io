# Unitary Thrift

Unitary thrift is a term often used in the context of banking and financial services, particularly referring to a specific type of savings and [loan](../l/loan.md) association or a mutual savings [bank](../b/bank.md) that operates in the United States. These entities are designed to encourage savings among members and provide residential [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) loans. They typically operate under a more community-focused model compared to commercial banks and are often seen as vital to the [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) of the communities they serve.

## Overview of Unitary Thrift

A unitary thrift can be described as a financial institution that combines the capabilities of a savings and [loan](../l/loan.md) association with those of a [commercial bank](../c/commercial_bank.md), often [offering](../o/offering.md) a full [range](../r/range.md) of banking services. At the core, unitary thrifts focus on accepting deposits and providing [home](../h/home.md) loans, but they also engage in other banking activities, catering to individual consumers as well as small to medium-sized businesses.

## Historical Context

The concept of thrifts dates back to the 19th century when mutual savings banks first emerged in the United States. These institutions were created to provide lower-[income](../i/income.md) individuals with a safe place to save [money](../m/money.md) and [gain](../g/gain.md) access to affordable [home](../h/home.md) loans. Over time, the role of thrifts expanded, and they became pivotal in helping to [finance](../f/finance.md) the [American Dream](../a/american_dream.md) by supporting homeownership.

The term "unitary thrift" gained prominence in the latter half of the 20th century as changes in federal banking laws permitted these institutions more flexibility in their operations. The regulatory environment allowed thrifts to diversify their [loan](../l/loan.md) portfolios and service offerings, gradually morphing into entities resembling traditional commercial banks.

## Regulatory Environment

Unitary thrifts operate under a specific regulatory framework designed to ensure their stability and protect consumer interests. Initially, thrifts were regulated by the Federal [Home](../h/home.md) [Loan](../l/loan.md) [Bank](../b/bank.md) Board (FHLBB) and the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS). However, these responsibilities have since been transferred to the Office of the Comptroller of the [Currency](../c/currency.md) (OCC) and the Federal [Deposit](../d/deposit.md) [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) (FDIC) following the financial reforms brought about by the [Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act](../d/dodd-frank_wall_street_reform_and_consumer_protection_act.md) in 2010.

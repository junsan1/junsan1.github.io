# Universal Market Integrity Rules (UMIR)

## Introduction to UMIR

The Universal Market Integrity Rules (UMIR) is a comprehensive regulatory framework established by the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) to ensure fair and equitable trading practices within Canadian financial markets. These rules are designed to maintain the integrity of markets by preventing fraudulent and manipulative activities, promoting transparent and efficient market operations, and protecting investors. UMIR applies to all participants in the trading of securities on Canadian marketplaces and serves as the backbone of market conduct regulation in Canada.

## Key Components of UMIR

UMIR encompasses various critical areas that govern the behavior and practices of market participants. These components include:

### 1. **Trading Rules**
Trading rules stipulate the operational standards and conduct required for trading activities. They ensure that trades are executed fairly, efficiently, and transparently. Some of the fundamental trading rules under UMIR include:

- **Order Handling and Execution**: Standards for the proper handling of customer orders, including best execution obligations.
- **Trade Reporting**: Requirements for timely and accurate reporting of trades to provide transparency in the marketplace.
- **Pre-trade and Post-trade Transparency**: Rules around the dissemination of trade-related information before and after trades occur to ensure market participants have access to essential data.

### 2. **Market Manipulation and Fraud Prevention**
UMIR includes provisions to prevent and detect market manipulation and fraudulent activities. These rules aim to safeguard market integrity by prohibiting practices such as:

- **Insider Trading**: The use of non-public information to gain an unfair advantage in trading.
- **Manipulative and Deceptive Activities**: Actions intended to distort the market, such as spoofing, layering, and wash trading.
- **Front-Running**: Trading ahead of customer orders to profit from the anticipated market impact.

### 3. **Compliance and Supervision**
UMIR mandates rigorous compliance and supervision standards for market participants. This requirement ensures that firms maintain adequate supervisory systems to detect and prevent non-compliance with trading rules. Key elements include:

- **Surveillance**: Continuous monitoring of trading activities to identify and address irregularities.
- **Internal Controls**: Implementation of robust internal control systems to monitor and manage compliance risk.
- **Record Keeping**: Maintaining detailed records of trading activities and communications for regulatory review and investigation.

### 4. **Market Conduct**
These rules encompass a broad range of ethical and professional standards that market participants must adhere to, including:

- **Fair Dealing**: Ensuring fair treatment of all market participants.
- **Transparency**: Promoting openness and honesty in all market-related communications and disclosures.
- **Conflict of Interest Management**: Identifying, mitigating, and disclosing conflicts of interest to ensure unbiased decision-making.

## UMIR and Algo-Trading

Algorithmic trading, or algo-trading, refers to the use of automated systems to execute trades based on pre-defined strategies. UMIR sets forth specific rules to address the unique challenges and risks associated with algo-trading, such as:

### 1. **Risk Management Controls and Supervisory Procedures**
Algo-trading participants are required to establish risk management controls and supervisory procedures to manage the risks associated with high-speed trading. These include:

- **Pre-trade Risk Controls**: Measures to prevent erroneous orders and unintended trading strategies.
- **Post-trade Monitoring**: Continuous assessment of trading activities to identify and address anomalies.
- **System Testings and Validation**: Ensuring that algo-trading systems are rigorously tested and validated before deployment.

### 2. **Market Disruption and Manipulation Prevention**
Specific rules are designed to prevent market disruption and manipulation through the use of algorithms. Some measures include:

- **Order-to-Trade Ratios**: Restrictions on the ratio of non-executable orders to executed trades to prevent excessive order submission.
- **Throttles and Kill Switches**: Mechanisms to quickly halt trading in the event of system malfunctions or market anomalies.

### 3. **Transparency and Accountability**
UMIR requires algo-trading participants to maintain transparency and accountability in their strategies and operations, such as:

- **Disclosure of Algorithms**: Documentation of trading algorithms and strategies for regulatory review.
- **Trade Reporting and Audit Trails**: Detailed records of algo-trading activities for transparency and regulatory oversight.

## Enforcement and Penalties

UMIR violations can result in significant penalties, including fines, suspensions, and revocation of trading privileges. Enforcement actions are taken by IIROC, which has the authority to investigate, adjudicate, and penalize non-compliant market participants. Examples of enforcement actions include:

- **Disciplinary Hearings**: Formal proceedings to determine whether UMIR violations have occurred and to impose appropriate sanctions.
- **Settlements**: Negotiated resolutions between IIROC and market participants to address compliance issues and agree on penalties.
- **Remedial Actions**: Requirements for firms to implement corrective measures to prevent future violations, such as enhanced supervision or system upgrades.

## Conclusion

The Universal Market Integrity Rules form a critical foundation for maintaining the integrity, transparency, and efficiency of Canadian financial markets. By establishing comprehensive guidelines for trading practices, compliance, and supervision, UMIR helps protect investors, promote fair competition, and ensure the smooth functioning of financial markets. With the ongoing evolution of trading technologies and strategies, UMIR will continue to adapt and evolve to address emerging risks and challenges, thereby upholding the principles of market integrity.

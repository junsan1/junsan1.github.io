# Universal Market Integrity Rules (UMIR)

## Introduction to UMIR

The Universal [Market](../m/market.md) Integrity Rules (UMIR) is a comprehensive regulatory framework established by the Investment [Industry](../i/industry.md) Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) to ensure fair and equitable trading practices within Canadian [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). These rules are designed to maintain the integrity of markets by preventing fraudulent and manipulative activities, promoting transparent and efficient [market](../m/market.md) operations, and protecting investors. UMIR applies to all participants in the trading of securities on Canadian marketplaces and serves as the backbone of [market](../m/market.md) conduct regulation in Canada.

## Key Components of UMIR

UMIR encompasses various critical areas that govern the behavior and practices of [market](../m/market.md) participants. These components include:

### 1. **Trading Rules**
[Trading rules](../t/trading_rules.md) stipulate the operational standards and conduct required for trading activities. They ensure that trades are executed fairly, efficiently, and transparently. Some of the fundamental [trading rules](../t/trading_rules.md) under UMIR include:

- **[Order](../o/order.md) Handling and [Execution](../e/execution.md)**: Standards for the proper handling of [customer](../c/customer.md) orders, including best [execution](../e/execution.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md).
- **[Trade](../t/trade.md) Reporting**: Requirements for timely and accurate reporting of trades to provide [transparency](../t/transparency.md) in the marketplace.
- **Pre-[trade](../t/trade.md) and Post-[trade](../t/trade.md) [Transparency](../t/transparency.md)**: Rules around the dissemination of [trade](../t/trade.md)-related information before and after trades occur to ensure [market](../m/market.md) participants have access to essential data.

### 2. **Market Manipulation and Fraud Prevention**
UMIR includes provisions to prevent and detect [market manipulation](../m/market_manipulation.md) and fraudulent activities. These rules aim to safeguard [market](../m/market.md) integrity by prohibiting practices such as:

- **[Insider Trading](../i/insider.md)**: The use of non-public information to [gain](../g/gain.md) an unfair advantage in trading.
- **Manipulative and Deceptive Activities**: Actions intended to distort the [market](../m/market.md), such as [spoofing](../s/spoofing.md), layering, and [wash trading](../w/wash_trading.md).
- **[Front-Running](../f/front-running.md)**: Trading ahead of [customer](../c/customer.md) orders to [profit](../p/profit.md) from the anticipated [market](../m/market.md) impact.

### 3. **Compliance and Supervision**
UMIR mandates rigorous compliance and supervision standards for [market](../m/market.md) participants. This requirement ensures that firms maintain adequate supervisory systems to detect and prevent non-compliance with [trading rules](../t/trading_rules.md). Key elements include:

- **Surveillance**: Continuous monitoring of trading activities to identify and address irregularities.
- **[Internal Controls](../i/internal_controls.md)**: Implementation of [robust](../r/robust.md) internal control systems to monitor and manage compliance [risk](../r/risk.md).
- **Record Keeping**: Maintaining detailed records of trading activities and communications for regulatory review and investigation.

### 4. **Market Conduct**
These rules encompass a broad [range](../r/range.md) of ethical and professional standards that [market](../m/market.md) participants must adhere to, including:

- **Fair Dealing**: Ensuring fair treatment of all [market](../m/market.md) participants.
- **[Transparency](../t/transparency.md)**: Promoting openness and honesty in all [market](../m/market.md)-related communications and disclosures.
- **[Conflict of Interest](../c/conflict_of_interest.md) Management**: Identifying, mitigating, and disclosing conflicts of [interest](../i/interest.md) to ensure unbiased decision-making.

## UMIR and Algo-Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), or algo-trading, refers to the use of automated systems to execute trades based on pre-defined strategies. UMIR sets forth specific rules to address the unique challenges and risks associated with algo-trading, such as:

### 1. **Risk Management Controls and Supervisory Procedures**
Algo-trading participants are required to establish [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) controls and supervisory procedures to manage the risks associated with high-speed trading. These include:

- **Pre-[trade](../t/trade.md) [Risk](../r/risk.md) Controls**: Measures to prevent erroneous orders and unintended [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).
- **Post-[trade](../t/trade.md) Monitoring**: Continuous assessment of trading activities to identify and address anomalies.
- **System Testings and Validation**: Ensuring that algo-[trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md) are rigorously tested and validated before deployment.

### 2. **Market Disruption and Manipulation Prevention**
Specific rules are designed to prevent [market](../m/market.md) disruption and manipulation through the use of algorithms. Some measures include:

- **[Order](../o/order.md)-to-[Trade](../t/trade.md) Ratios**: Restrictions on the ratio of non-executable orders to executed trades to prevent excessive [order](../o/order.md) submission.
- **Throttles and [Kill](../k/kill.md) Switches**: Mechanisms to quickly halt trading in the event of system malfunctions or [market anomalies](../m/market_anomalies.md).

### 3. **Transparency and Accountability**
UMIR requires algo-trading participants to maintain [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and accountability in their strategies and operations, such as:

- **[Disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) of Algorithms**: Documentation of [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) and strategies for regulatory review.
- **[Trade](../t/trade.md) Reporting and Audit Trails**: Detailed records of algo-trading activities for [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and regulatory oversight.

## Enforcement and Penalties

UMIR violations can result in significant penalties, including fines, suspensions, and revocation of trading privileges. Enforcement actions are taken by IIROC, which has the authority to investigate, adjudicate, and penalize non-compliant [market](../m/market.md) participants. Examples of enforcement actions include:

- **Disciplinary Hearings**: Formal proceedings to determine whether UMIR violations have occurred and to impose appropriate sanctions.
- **Settlements**: Negotiated resolutions between IIROC and [market](../m/market.md) participants to address compliance issues and agree on penalties.
- **Remedial Actions**: Requirements for firms to implement corrective measures to prevent future violations, such as enhanced supervision or system upgrades.

## Conclusion

The Universal [Market](../m/market.md) Integrity Rules form a critical foundation for maintaining the integrity, [transparency](../t/transparency.md), and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) of Canadian [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). By establishing comprehensive guidelines for trading practices, compliance, and supervision, UMIR helps protect investors, promote fair competition, and ensure the smooth functioning of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). With the ongoing evolution of trading technologies and strategies, UMIR [will](../w/will.md) continue to adapt and evolve to address emerging risks and challenges, thereby upholding the principles of [market](../m/market.md) integrity.

# Unconventional Oil

Unconventional oil refers to [petroleum](../p/petroleum.md) produced or extracted using techniques other than the traditional oil-well method. These resources typically include [oil sands](../o/oil_sands.md), extra-heavy oil, shale oil, and [liquid](../l/liquid.md) [petroleum](../p/petroleum.md) produced from gas-to-liquids (GTL), coal-to-liquids (CTL), and biomass-to-liquids (BTL) technologies. Unconventional oil production methods usually involve more complex processes and higher costs compared to conventional oil extraction.

## Types of Unconventional Oil

### Oil Sands
[Oil sands](../o/oil_sands.md), also known as tar sands, consist of a mixture of sand, clay, water, and bitumen. Bitumen is a thick, sticky form of [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md) that must be extracted and processed before it can be refined into fuels. Alberta, Canada, and Venezuela's Orinoco Belt are two major regions with significant [oil sands](../o/oil_sands.md) deposits.

### Extra-Heavy Oil
Extra-heavy oil is a category of crude [petroleum](../p/petroleum.md) that is very viscous and dense. It generally has an API gravity of less than 10° and must be processed similarly to bitumen. The Orinoco Heavy Oil Belt in Venezuela is one of the world's largest sources of extra-heavy oil.

### Shale Oil
Shale oil is extracted from oil shale rock fragments through pyrolysis, hydrogenation, or thermal dissolution. Unlike shale gas, which is extracted using [hydraulic fracturing](../h/hydraulic_fracturing.md), shale oil requires more intensive processing to become [market](../m/market.md)-ready. The Bakken Formation in the United States is a significant source of shale oil.

### Gas-to-Liquids (GTL)
Gas-to-liquids is a process that converts natural gas into [liquid](../l/liquid.md) hydrocarbons, typically employing the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Major players in this field include Shell with their Pearl GTL plant in Qatar. For more details: [Shell GTL](https://www.shell.com/about-us/major-projects/pearl-gtl.html).

### Coal-to-Liquids (CTL)
Coal-to-liquids technology converts coal into [liquid](../l/liquid.md) hydrocarbons through either direct liquefaction or an indirect liquefaction process. This technique has gained attention primarily in countries with abundant coal resources but limited [oil reserves](../o/oil_reserves.md). Sasol, a South African company, is a leader in CTL technology. Visit: [Sasol](https://www.sasol.com/what-we-do/our-operations/our-operations/ctl).

### Biomass-to-Liquids (BTL)
Biomass-to-liquids converts organic material into [liquid](../l/liquid.md) biofuels using a variety of thermochemical processes. Given the push for sustainable energy, BTL is becoming an increasingly relevant part of the unconventional oil sector. An example of a company focused on BTL is Neste: [Neste](https://www.neste.com/sustainable-business/biofuels).

## Extraction Techniques

### Surface Mining
Surface [mining](../m/mining.md) is commonly used for [oil sands](../o/oil_sands.md) extraction. The process involves excavating the earth to remove the sands, which are then transported to a processing [facility](../f/facility.md) where bitumen is separated from the material.

### In-Situ Methods
In-situ extraction techniques are employed when [oil sands](../o/oil_sands.md) or extra-heavy oil deposits are too deep for surface [mining](../m/mining.md). This includes Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) and Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS).

### Hydraulic Fracturing (Fracking)
[Hydraulic fracturing](../h/hydraulic_fracturing.md) is primarily used for shale oil and gas extraction. This technique involves injecting high-pressure fluid into the ground to fracture the shale rock and release the trapped oil or gas.

### Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis
Fischer-Tropsch synthesis is crucial for GTL, CTL, and BTL processes. It involves converting carbon monoxide and hydrogen (syngas) into [liquid](../l/liquid.md) hydrocarbons using a catalyst under specific temperatures and pressures.

## Economic Considerations

### Cost of Extraction
Unconventional oil extraction generally incurs higher costs compared to its conventional counterpart. Factors include the complexity of extraction, the need for advanced technology, and environmental regulations.

### Market Volatility
The profitability of unconventional oil projects is closely tied to global oil prices. A significant drop in [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md) prices can render many unconventional oil projects economically unviable.

### Investment Risk
[Investing](../i/investing.md) in unconventional oil projects is considered high-[risk](../r/risk.md) due to factors like high operational costs, technological challenges, and [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md). However, potential high rewards continue to attract investors.

## Environmental Impact

### Carbon Emissions
Unconventional oil production is often associated with higher greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional oil. Technologies like CTL and GTL are energy-intensive, leading to increased CO2 output.

### Land Use and Water Consumption
Surface [mining](../m/mining.md) for [oil sands](../o/oil_sands.md) requires substantial land use and leads to significant environmental disruption. Additionally, in-situ methods and [hydraulic fracturing](../h/hydraulic_fracturing.md) consume large amounts of water, potentially affecting local water resources.

### Pollution and Waste
[Oil sands](../o/oil_sands.md) and shale oil extraction generate large amounts of waste materials, including toxic tailings and spent shale. Improper disposal can lead to soil and water contamination.

## Regulatory Framework

### Government Policies
Governments play a crucial role in regulating unconventional oil activities. Policies may include subsidies for technology development, environmental regulations, and [taxation](../t/taxation.md) schemes.

### International Agreements
International climate agreements, such as the Paris Agreement, exert pressure on countries to reduce their carbon footprint, indirectly affecting the unconventional oil sector.

### Permits and Licenses
Companies involved in unconventional oil extraction must obtain numerous permits and licenses, often facing strict scrutiny related to environmental impact assessments and safety protocols.

## Technological Innovations

### Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR)
EOR techniques are employed to maximize extraction rates from unconventional oil reservoirs. Methods include thermal recovery, gas injection, and chemical flooding.

### Digital Oilfields
The integration of digital technologies, such as IoT sensors, AI, and [data analytics](../d/data_analytics.md), is revolutionizing unconventional oil extraction. Digital oilfields aim to increase [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md), reduce costs, and enhance safety.

### Alternative Fuels Development
Research is ongoing in alternative fuels to [complement](../c/complement.md) and eventually replace conventional and unconventional oil. Initiatives include developing synthetic fuels, advanced biofuels, and hydrogen technologies.

## Case Studies

### Alberta Oil Sands
The Alberta [oil sands](../o/oil_sands.md) represent one of the most developed unconventional oil resources globally. Companies like Suncor Energy and Syncrude Canada have invested heavily in [mining](../m/mining.md) and in-situ techniques to extract bitumen.

### Bakken Shale
The Bakken Shale formation in North Dakota is a prime example of shale oil production. Pioneered by companies like Continental Resources and Hess [Corporation](../c/corporation.md), the region has seen significant growth in oil output thanks to advances in [hydraulic fracturing](../h/hydraulic_fracturing.md).

### Pearl GTL
Shell's Pearl GTL plant in Qatar is the world’s largest GTL [facility](../f/facility.md). It converts natural gas into high-quality [liquid](../l/liquid.md) hydrocarbons, including diesel and naphtha.

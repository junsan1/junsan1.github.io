# Upside Capture Ratio

## Introduction

The [Upside](../u/upside.md) Capture Ratio is a crucial metric for investors and portfolio managers to assess a [fund](../f/fund.md)'s performance relative to a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) during periods of [market](../m/market.md) upswings. It quantifies how well a [fund](../f/fund.md) captures gains when the [market](../m/market.md) is rising. For example, an [upside](../u/upside.md) capture ratio of 120% implies that the [fund](../f/fund.md) performs 20% better than the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) during upward [market](../m/market.md) movements.

## Calculation

The [Upside](../u/upside.md) Capture Ratio (UCR) is typically expressed as a percentage. The general formula for calculating the UCR is:

```
UCR = (r_fund_up / r_benchmark_up) * 100
```

Here:
- `r_fund_up` is the portfolio's [return](../r/return.md) during up-[market](../m/market.md) periods.
- `r_benchmark_up` is the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md)'s [return](../r/return.md) during those same periods.

## Importance in Performance Assessment

The [Upside](../u/upside.md) Capture Ratio is essential for understanding how well an investment (such as a [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md), ETF, etc.) performs in favorable [market](../m/market.md) conditions:
- **[Benchmark Comparison](../b/benchmark_comparison.md)**: It offers a direct comparison to a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md), highlighting whether the manager is adding excess returns during upswings.
- **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Balancing UCR with the Downside Capture Ratio (DCR) helps investors understand how a [fund](../f/fund.md) performs in both positive and negative [market](../m/market.md) conditions.
- **Investment Decisions**: Allows investors to choose funds that are more likely to deliver higher returns in rising markets.

## Interpreting the Ratio

### Greater than 100%

An [Upside](../u/upside.md) Capture Ratio greater than 100% suggests that the [fund](../f/fund.md) is outperforming the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) in up-[market](../m/market.md) conditions. For instance, a ratio of 120% means the [fund](../f/fund.md) achieved 20% more gains than the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) during rising markets.

### Less than 100%

A ratio below 100% indicates that the [fund](../f/fund.md) underperforms relative to the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) during [market](../m/market.md) upswings. For example, a ratio of 80% means the [fund](../f/fund.md) gained only 80% of the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md)'s [return](../r/return.md) in such periods.

### Equal to 100%

An [Upside](../u/upside.md) Capture Ratio of 100% means the [fund](../f/fund.md) performed on par with the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) during up-[market](../m/market.md) periods.

## Practical Example

Consider a [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md) that aims to [outperform](../o/outperform.md) the S&P 500. If over a specific period, the S&P 500 rises by 10% and the [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md) rises by 12%, the [Upside](../u/upside.md) Capture Ratio would be calculated as follows:

```
UCR = (12% / 10%) * 100 = 120%
```

This ratio indicates that the [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md) captured 120% of the [market](../m/market.md)'s [upside](../u/upside.md) during this period.

## Applications

### Mutual Funds and ETFs

[Fund](../f/fund.md) managers and analysts use the UCR to evaluate how well managed products are performing relative to benchmarks. It helps in constructing portfolios that are expected to capture more [upside](../u/upside.md) in bullish [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

### Hedge Funds

[Hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds often employ this ratio to [market](../m/market.md) their strategies. Highlighting a high UCR can attract investors looking for aggressive growth during positive [market](../m/market.md) trends.

### Asset Allocation

Advisors and institutional investors use UCR to determine the suitability of various assets in diversified portfolios. A higher UCR is often desired for growth-oriented allocations.

### Performance Reporting

Regular performance reports for funds usually include the UCR to provide a clear picture of performance during upward [market](../m/market.md) movements. 

## Real-World Example: BlackRock

BlackRock offers various mutual funds and ETFs, many of which are benchmarked against major indices like the S&P 500 or the MSCI World [Index](../i/index_instrument.md). They use metrics like the [Upside](../u/upside.md) Capture Ratio in their performance reporting to highlight how well their funds perform compared to these benchmarks during periods of [market](../m/market.md) gains. More information can be found on their [website](https://www.blackrock.com).

## Conclusion

The [Upside](../u/upside.md) Capture Ratio is a valuable tool for investors seeking to understand the performance dynamics of their investments during periods of [market](../m/market.md) growth. By revealing how well a [fund](../f/fund.md) captures the gains relative to a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md), it aids in making informed investment choices and developing strategies that align with one's financial goals. Balancing UCR with other metrics ensures a comprehensive understanding of a [fund](../f/fund.md)'s [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md) profile.

# Unscheduled Property Floater

An unscheduled property floater is a type of [insurance](../i/insurance.md) policy or [endorsement](../e/endorsement.md) that provides coverage for [personal property](../p/personal_property.md) items without specifically listing them or assigning individual values. This type of policy is especially useful for items that are high in [value](../v/value.md) or prone to damage, loss, or theft, where the collective [value](../v/value.md) exceeds the standard coverage limits provided by a typical homeowner's or [renter's insurance](../r/renter's_insurance.md) policy. 

## Understanding Unscheduled Property Floaters

### Basic Concept

The unscheduled property floater is designed to fill [gaps](../g/gap.md) left by traditional [insurance](../i/insurance.md) policies. Most homeowner's or [renter's insurance](../r/renter's_insurance.md) policies [will](../w/will.md) have specific limits on the coverage for certain types of [personal property](../p/personal_property.md), such as jewelry, electronics, or collectibles. If the [value](../v/value.md) of these items surpasses the limit, the policyholder could face considerable [out-of-pocket expenses](../o/out-of-pocket_expenses.md) in the event of loss or damage. 

An unscheduled property floater provides additional coverage for these items, without the need to itemize each one individually. This is different from a "scheduled" property floater, where each item must be [listed](../l/listed.md) along with its [value](../v/value.md).

### Coverage Details

- **Broad Protection**: Unlike standard policies that may exclude certain types of loss, unscheduled property floaters typically [offer](../o/offer.md) broader protection, covering incidents such as accidental damage, loss, and theft.
- **Higher Limits**: These policies often provide higher coverage limits than traditional [home](../h/home.md) [insurance](../i/insurance.md). This is crucial for high-[value](../v/value.md) items that exceed the standard policy limits.
- **[Worldwide Coverage](../w/worldwide_coverage.md)**: One of the attractions of an unscheduled property floater is that it often includes [worldwide coverage](../w/worldwide_coverage.md), protecting your items wherever you travel.
- **Flexibility**: There's no need to update the policy each time you acquire a new item of [value](../v/value.md), unlike scheduled floaters which require updates and appraisals.

### Example Use-Cases

Unscheduled property floaters are frequently used for:

- **Jewelry and Watches**: These are high-[value](../v/value.md) items that exceed typical policy sub-limits.
- **Electronics**: Laptops, cameras, and other high-tech gadgets.
- **Fine Art**: Paintings, sculptures, and other valuable collectibles.
- **Musical Instruments**: Especially useful for professional musicians who travel frequently.
- **Sports Equipment**: Expensive items like skis, golf clubs, and other specialized gear.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

1. **Convenience**: Handling new purchases or changes does not require constant updates to the policy.
2. **Broad Coverage**: Offers extensive protection against all types of risks, including accidental damage and [worldwide coverage](../w/worldwide_coverage.md).
3. **Higher Limits**: Provides coverage for items that exceed the sub-limits of standard policies.

### Disadvantages

1. **Cost**: Generally, unscheduled property floaters are more expensive than standard policy add-ons due to the broader coverage and higher limits.
2. **Documentation**: In case of a claim, you may still need to provide proof of ownership and [value](../v/value.md).
3. **Ambiguity**: The lack of itemization can sometimes create ambiguity during the claims process.

## Acquisition Process

Obtaining an unscheduled property floater generally involves:

1. **Assessing Needs**: Determine whether your [personal property](../p/personal_property.md) exceeds the coverage limits of your existing policy.
2. **Consulting with Insurer**: Discuss with your [insurance](../i/insurance.md) provider the specific terms, coverage limits, and [premium](../p/premium.md) associated with the floater.
3. **Documentation**: While itemization isn't necessary, keeping [receipts](../r/receipt.md) and appraisals as supporting documents for future claims is advisable.
4. **Policy Addition**: The floater is added as an [endorsement](../e/endorsement.md) to your existing homeowner's or [renter's insurance](../r/renter's_insurance.md) policy.

## Claims Process

In the event of a claim, the general steps are:

1. **Report the Incident**: Notify your [insurance](../i/insurance.md) provider about the loss or damage as soon as possible.
2. **Provide Proof**: Submit any available proof of ownership and [value](../v/value.md), like [receipts](../r/receipt.md) or appraisals.
3. **Claim Assessment**: The insurer [will](../w/will.md) assess the claim based on the policy terms.
4. **[Payout](../p/payout.md)**: If the claim is approved, the insurer [will](../w/will.md) [issue](../i/issue.md) a [payout](../p/payout.md) based on the agreed limits.

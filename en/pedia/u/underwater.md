# Underwater

In the realm of [finance](../f/finance.md) and trading, the term "Underwater" refers to the condition where an [asset](../a/asset.md) or investment is worth less than its original purchase price or its previous [market](../m/market.md) high. This concept is critically important for traders, investors, and financial analysts who continuously assess [portfolio performance](../p/portfolio_performance.md), [risk](../r/risk.md), and opportunities for recovery or [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md). Below, we [will](../w/will.md) explore the facets of what it means to be underwater, the implications of being underwater in various financial instruments, metrics used to track underwater status, and some strategies to mitigate or recover from underwater conditions.

## Basics of Being Underwater

### Definition
When an investment is underwater, its [market value](../m/market_value.md) is lower than the price at which it was acquired. This often leads to [unrealized losses](../u/unrealized_losses.md) for the holder of the [asset](../a/asset.md), raising concerns around [capital preservation](../c/capital_preservation.md), [opportunity cost](../o/opportunity_cost.md), and potential [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) issues.

For example:
- An [investor](../i/investor.md) buys 100 [shares](../s/shares.md) of a company at $50 per share. The current [market price](../m/market_price.md) falls to $40 per share. In this case, the investment is said to be underwater by $10 per share, or $1,000 in total.

Understanding and managing underwater positions are crucial for both retail and professional investors. The ability to assess whether and how an [asset](../a/asset.md) might recover its [value](../v/value.md) can strongly influence trading decisions, [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), and overall financial strategy.

### Implications
Being underwater affects different stakeholders in various ways:
- **Investors**: Facing potential losses, increased scrutiny, and stress over decision-making to [hold](../h/hold.md) or sell.
- **Companies**: May face increased [investor](../i/investor.md) pressure, fearing sell-offs, reduced [capitalization](../c/capitalization.md), and possible [dilution](../d/dilution.md) in case of future [capital](../c/capital.md) raising activities.
- **Financial Advisors**: Need to provide [guidance](../g/guidance.md) and strategies to clients to either mitigate losses or [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on potential recovery.

## Financial Instruments and Underwater Conditions

### Equities
Equities, or stock investments, are one of the most common instruments where the concept of being underwater is frequently observed. Stock prices are subject to [market](../m/market.md) forces, including company performance, macroeconomic conditions, and [investor](../i/investor.md) sentiment. 

### Real Estate
[Real estate](../r/real_estate.md) investments can also become underwater, especially after financial crises or [market](../m/market.md) corrections. When the [value](../v/value.md) of a property drops below the outstanding balance on the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md), homeowners face [negative equity](../n/negative_equity.md). This scenario was widely observed during the 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md).

### Futures and Options
In [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) markets, [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) and [options](../o/options.md) can be underwater if the [market](../m/market.md) moves against the position of the [trader](../t/trader.md). For example, in [options](../o/options.md) trading, if a [call option](../c/call_option.md)'s [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) is above the current [market price](../m/market_price.md), it is said to be out-of-the-[money](../m/money.md) or underwater.

### Cryptocurrencies
The highly volatile nature of cryptocurrencies makes them prone to go underwater frequently. Cryptocurrency traders often experience wide fluctuations in [asset](../a/asset.md) [value](../v/value.md), leading to periods where their positions are worth significantly less than their purchase price.

## Metrics to Monitor

### Drawdown
[Drawdown](../d/drawdown.md) is a measure used to assess how much an investment has declined from its peak [value](../v/value.md) before recovering. This is a critical metric for understanding how underwater an investment has gone.

- **Maximum [Drawdown](../d/drawdown.md) (MDD)**: The maximum observed loss from a peak to a [trough](../t/trough.md), expressed as a percentage.
- **Time Underwater**: The [duration](../d/duration.md) during which an [asset](../a/asset.md) remains below its peak [value](../v/value.md). Extended periods underwater can be particularly concerning for long-term investors.

### Break-even Analysis
[Break-even analysis](../b/break-even_analysis.md) helps to determine the price point at which an investment returns to its original purchase price. It plays a critical role in decision-making for either holding or liquidating the [asset](../a/asset.md).

### Recovery Factor
This metric assesses how quickly an [asset](../a/asset.md) recovers from being underwater. It is defined as the time taken to recuperate losses and [return](../r/return.md) to previous peak values.

## Strategies for Recovery

### Dollar-Cost Averaging
Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is an [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) where an [investor](../i/investor.md) divides the total amount to be invested across periodic purchases of a target [asset](../a/asset.md), thereby reducing the impact of [volatility](../v/volatility.md) on the overall purchase. This can help mitigate the effects of being underwater by lowering the average cost per share.

### Stop-Loss Orders
A [stop-loss order](../s/stop-loss_order.md) is designed to limit an [investor](../i/investor.md)'s loss on a position in a [security](../s/security.md). By setting a predetermined sell point, investors can minimize their losses if the price drops below a certain level.

### Diversification
[Diversification](../d/diversification.md) involves spreading investments across various financial instruments, industries, or other categories to reduce exposure to any one [asset](../a/asset.md). [Diversification](../d/diversification.md) can help manage [risk](../r/risk.md) and reduce the chances of the overall portfolio being underwater.

### Hedging
Hedging techniques, such as using [options](../o/options.md) contracts to [offset](../o/offset.md) potential losses in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), can be employed to protect against [downside risk](../d/downside_risk.md) and prevent positions from going underwater.

## Conclusion

Understanding the concept of being underwater is fundamental for anyone involved in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). By recognizing the implications and employing appropriate strategies, investors and traders can better navigate through periods of adverse [market](../m/market.md) conditions and aim for more informed and strategic financial decision-making.

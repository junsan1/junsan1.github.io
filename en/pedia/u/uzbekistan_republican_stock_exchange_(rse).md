The Uzbekistan Republican Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (RSE), commonly referred to as the Tashkent Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md), is the primary securities [exchange](../e/exchange.md) in Uzbekistan. It is a pivotal component of the countryâ€™s financial [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md), playing a crucial role in the development of [capital markets](../c/capital_markets.md) in Uzbekistan. The RSE provides a platform for the trading of various financial instruments, including equities, bonds, and other securities.

## Historical Background

The Uzbekistan RSE was established in 1994, following the country's independence from the Soviet Union. The establishment of the RSE marked a significant step towards building a [market](../m/market.md)-oriented [economy](../e/economy.md) in Uzbekistan. Initially, the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) operated as a [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md) for trading [shares](../s/shares.md) of state-owned enterprises that were privatized during the early 1990s.

Since its inception, the RSE has undergone significant transformations, adapting to the evolving financial landscape and regulatory environment. The [exchange](../e/exchange.md) has implemented various reforms to enhance [transparency](../t/transparency.md), improve [market efficiency](../m/market_efficiency.md), and attract both domestic and foreign investors.

## Structure and Organization

The RSE operates as a self-regulated organization, governed by a board of directors and overseen by the government of Uzbekistan. The [exchange](../e/exchange.md)'s activities are regulated by the Ministry of [Finance](../f/finance.md) and the Central [Bank](../b/bank.md) of Uzbekistan. The RSE's [organizational structure](../o/organizational_structure.md) includes several key departments, such as the trading department, listing department, and [clearing and settlement](../c/clearing_and_settlement.md) department.

### Trading Department

The trading department is responsible for managing the day-to-[day trading](../d/day_trading.md) activities on the [exchange](../e/exchange.md). This includes overseeing the [execution](../e/execution.md) of buy and sell orders, monitoring [market](../m/market.md) conditions, and ensuring compliance with trading regulations. The department also provides [market](../m/market.md) participants with real-time data and analytics to facilitate informed decision-making.

### Listing Department

The listing department manages the process of admitting companies and securities to be traded on the [exchange](../e/exchange.md). This involves conducting [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md), assessing the [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) of potential issuers, and ensuring compliance with [listing requirements](../l/listing_requirements.md). The department also provides support to [listed](../l/listed.md) companies, helping them navigate regulatory requirements and maintain transparent communication with investors.

### Clearing and Settlement Department

The [clearing and settlement](../c/clearing_and_settlement.md) department oversees the post-[trade](../t/trade.md) processes, ensuring that transactions are accurately recorded, cleared, and settled. This department is responsible for minimizing [counterparty risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md) and ensuring the timely transfer of securities and funds between buyers and sellers.

## Trading Mechanism

The RSE utilizes an electronic trading system, which allows [market](../m/market.md) participants to place orders and execute trades in a transparent and efficient manner. The trading system operates on a T+2 settlement cycle, meaning that transactions are settled two [business](../b/business.md) days after the [trade](../t/trade.md) date. The [exchange](../e/exchange.md) offers various [order types](../o/order_types_in_trading.md), including [market](../m/market.md) orders, limit orders, and stop orders, to accommodate different [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

### Trading Sessions

The RSE conducts trading sessions on weekdays, typically from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM local time. The trading day is divided into several sessions, including a pre-opening session, continuous [trading session](../t/trading_session.md), and closing session. The pre-opening session allows participants to submit and modify orders before the [market](../m/market.md) opens, while the continuous [trading session](../t/trading_session.md) facilitates the [execution](../e/execution.md) of trades throughout the day. The closing session determines the final prices for securities based on the closing auction.

### Market Makers

To enhance [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and ensure fair pricing, the RSE appoints [market](../m/market.md) makers for specific securities. [Market](../m/market.md) makers are obligated to provide continuous [bid](../b/bid.md) and [offer](../o/offer.md) quotes, thereby facilitating smoother trading and reducing price [volatility](../v/volatility.md). These [market](../m/market.md) makers are typically financial institutions with significant [market](../m/market.md) expertise and resources.

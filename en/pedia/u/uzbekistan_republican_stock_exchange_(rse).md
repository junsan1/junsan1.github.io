# Uzbekistan Republican Stock Exchange (RSE)

The Uzbekistan Republican Stock Exchange (RSE), commonly referred to as the Tashkent Stock Exchange, is the primary securities exchange in Uzbekistan. It is a pivotal component of the countryâ€™s financial infrastructure, playing a crucial role in the development of capital markets in Uzbekistan. The RSE provides a platform for the trading of various financial instruments, including equities, bonds, and other securities.

## Historical Background

The Uzbekistan RSE was established in 1994, following the country's independence from the Soviet Union. The establishment of the RSE marked a significant step towards building a market-oriented economy in Uzbekistan. Initially, the exchange operated as a secondary market for trading shares of state-owned enterprises that were privatized during the early 1990s.

Since its inception, the RSE has undergone significant transformations, adapting to the evolving financial landscape and regulatory environment. The exchange has implemented various reforms to enhance transparency, improve market efficiency, and attract both domestic and foreign investors.

## Structure and Organization

The RSE operates as a self-regulated organization, governed by a board of directors and overseen by the government of Uzbekistan. The exchange's activities are regulated by the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Uzbekistan. The RSE's organizational structure includes several key departments, such as the trading department, listing department, and clearing and settlement department.

### Trading Department

This includes overseeing the execution of buy and sell orders, monitoring market conditions, and ensuring compliance with trading regulations. The department also provides market participants with real-time data and analytics to facilitate informed decision-making.

### Listing Department

The listing department manages the process of admitting companies and securities to be traded on the exchange.

The department also provides support to listed companies, helping them navigate regulatory requirements and maintain transparent communication with investors.

### Clearing and Settlement Department

The clearing and settlement department oversees the post-trade processes, ensuring that transactions are accurately recorded, cleared, and settled. This department is responsible for minimizing counterparty risk and ensuring the timely transfer of securities and funds between buyers and sellers.

## Trading Mechanism

The RSE utilizes an electronic trading system, which allows market participants to place orders and execute trades in a transparent and efficient manner. The trading system operates on a T+2 settlement cycle, meaning that transactions are settled two business days after the trade date. The exchange offers various order types, including market orders, limit orders, and stop orders, to accommodate different trading strategies.

### Trading Sessions

The RSE conducts trading sessions on weekdays, typically from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM local time. The trading day is divided into several sessions, including a pre-opening session, continuous trading session, and closing session. The pre-opening session allows participants to submit and modify orders before the market opens, while the continuous trading session facilitates the execution of trades throughout the day. The closing session determines the final prices for securities based on the closing auction.

### Market Makers

To enhance liquidity and ensure fair pricing, the RSE appoints market makers for specific securities. Market makers are obligated to provide continuous bid and offer quotes, thereby facilitating smoother trading and reducing price volatility.

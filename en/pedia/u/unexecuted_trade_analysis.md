# Unexecuted Trade Analysis

## Introduction

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), also known as algo-trading or black-box trading, leverages computer programs to execute trades at speeds and frequencies that are impossible for a human [trader](../t/trader.md) to achieve. This practice involves the use of automated pre-programmed trading instructions [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for variables such as time, price, and [volume](../v/volume.md). A crucial yet often overlooked aspect of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) is unexecuted [trade](../t/trade.md) analysis.

## Unexecuted Trade Analysis: An Overview

Unexecuted [trade](../t/trade.md) analysis investigates the trades that an algorithm identifies as potential opportunities but ultimately does not execute. These missed opportunities, also known as "misses" or "abandons," can occur for various reasons, such as [slippage](../s/slippage.md), latency, [risk](../r/risk.md) constraints, or [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

Understanding why these trades were not executed can provide significant insights into the performance and potential improvements of a trading algorithm. This aspect of trading ensures that strategies are not only assessed based on their executed trades but also consider the missed opportunities to paint a comprehensive picture of algorithm performance.

## Key Factors Leading to Unexecuted Trades

1. **[Slippage](../s/slippage.md)**:
   [Slippage](../s/slippage.md) occurs when there is a difference between the expected price of a [trade](../t/trade.md) and the price at which the [trade](../t/trade.md) is actually executed. High [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) or insufficient [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) can contribute to [slippage](../s/slippage.md), leading to unexecuted trades.

2. **Latency**:
   Latency refers to the delay between the signal generation by the algorithm and the [execution](../e/execution.md) of the [trade](../t/trade.md). In high-frequency trading (HFT), even a millisecond delay can result in missed trading opportunities.

3. **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Constraints**:
   [Risk management](../r/risk_management.md) rules integrated into the trading algorithm may prevent certain trades from being executed. These constraints could be related to [position sizing](../p/position_sizing.md), stop-loss levels, or maximum permissible drawdowns.

4. **[Order](../o/order.md) Type Limitations**:
   Different types of orders ([market](../m/market.md) orders, limit orders, stop orders) have varied chances of [execution](../e/execution.md). For instance, a [limit order](../l/limit_order.md) might not be filled if the [market price](../m/market_price.md) doesn't reach the specified limit, leading to an unexecuted [trade](../t/trade.md).

5. **[Market](../m/market.md) Conditions**:
   Sudden changes in [market](../m/market.md) conditions, such as news releases or economic data announcements, can cause rapid price changes, resulting in missed trades.

## Methods for Analyzing Unexecuted Trades

1. **Time-Series Analysis**:
   Examining the timestamp data of unexecuted trades can help identify patterns or times when the algo repeatedly fails to execute trades. This can indicate systemic issues such as peak latency periods or specific times of [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

2. **[Slippage](../s/slippage.md) Analysis**:
   Analyzing the difference between expected and actual prices during periods of unexecuted trades can help quantify the impact of [slippage](../s/slippage.md) and develop measures to mitigate it.

3. **Historical [Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md)**:
   Running historical backtests which include both executed and unexecuted trades can [offer](../o/offer.md) a comparative view of the strategy’s performance and identify potential missed opportunities.

4. **Monte Carlo Simulations**:
   Performing Monte Carlo simulations on unexecuted [trade](../t/trade.md) data can assist in understanding the statistical likelihood of such misses and their potential impact on overall strategy performance.

5. **[Scenario Analysis](../s/scenario_analysis.md)**:
   By simulating different [market](../m/market.md) conditions and their effect on [trade](../t/trade.md) [execution](../e/execution.md), [scenario analysis](../s/scenario_analysis.md) can provide insights into the robustness and adaptability of the trading algorithm.

## Case Study: Example Company Analysis

Let's delve into a hypothetical scenario where an algorithm developed by a trading [firm](../f/firm.md), Algorithmica [Finance](../f/finance.md), is analyzed for unexecuted trades.

### Scenario

Algorithmica [Finance](../f/finance.md)’s flagship trading algorithm, AlgoX, was found to have an unexecuted [trade](../t/trade.md) rate of 15% during a volatile trading month. This rate was notably higher than the 7% rate during stable months.

### Analysis

1. **Latency Inspection**:
   By overlaying the unexecuted [trade](../t/trade.md) timestamps on the [firm](../f/firm.md)'s latency logs, it was discovered that latency spikes coincided with system updates and peak [market](../m/market.md) activity periods.

2. **[Slippage](../s/slippage.md) Review**:
   Reviewing [slippage](../s/slippage.md) instances revealed that trades were not entered due to rapidly changing [market](../m/market.md) prices, especially during news releases.

3. **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Constraint Evaluation**:
   Analysis of the algorithm's [risk](../r/risk.md) constraints showed that the maximum permissible [drawdown](../d/drawdown.md) settings were too conservative during volatile periods, preventing potential profitable trades.

### Amendments and Results

Based on these insights:

- Latency [optimization](../o/optimization.md) strategies, including more efficient coding and hardware upgrades, were implemented.
- A dynamic adjustment mechanism for [slippage](../s/slippage.md) tolerance based on [volatility](../v/volatility.md) measures was introduced.
- [Risk management](../r/risk_management.md) parameters were adjusted to reflect more lenient constraints during periods of increased [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

Post these amendments, the unexecuted [trade](../t/trade.md) rate fell from 15% to 8% in subsequent testing periods, showing a marked improvement in the algorithm’s performance.

## Tools and Technologies Involved

1. **Data Aggregators**:
   Tools like [Bloomberg](../b/bloomberg.md) Terminal and [Reuters](../r/reuters.md) Eikon can provide real-time and historical [market](../m/market.md) data for analysis.

2. **Latency Monitoring**:
   Software such as Corvil and SolarWinds can track and analyze latency issues within the trading [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md).

3. **Statistical Analysis Packages**:
   R, Python (with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy), and SAS are pivotal in conducting rigorous statistical analyses of unexecuted trades.

4. **[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) Platforms**:
   Platforms like [QuantConnect](../q/quantconnect.md) and [AlgoTrader](../a/algotrader.md) allow for comprehensive [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md), including unexecuted trades scenario modeling.

5. **[Simulation](../s/simulation_in_trading.md) Tools**:
   [Monte Carlo simulation](../m/monte_carlo_simulation.md) frameworks can be built using Python or R and integrated into [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) to estimate the impact of random [market](../m/market.md) conditions on unexecuted trades.

## Conclusion

Unexecuted [trade](../t/trade.md) analysis is an essential yet often overlooked aspect of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). By understanding and addressing the reasons behind unexecuted trades, traders can significantly enhance the effectiveness of their [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md). This analysis requires a multi-faceted approach, employing a variety of [data analysis techniques](../d/data_analysis_techniques.md) and tools to identify the root causes and implement effective solutions. Ultimately, the goal is to reduce the frequency of missed opportunities, thereby improving the overall performance and profitability of the [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md).

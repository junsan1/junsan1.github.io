# Unquoted Public Company

An unquoted [public company](../p/public_company.md), also known as an unlisted [public company](../p/public_company.md), is a type of [business](../b/business.md) structure that is recognized in many jurisdictions. Despite being designated as a [public company](../p/public_company.md), it does not have its [shares](../s/shares.md) traded on any formal stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md). This unique structure has implications from [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md), regulatory compliance, [stakeholder](../s/stakeholder.md) engagement, and [capital](../c/capital.md) raising perspectives. 

## Key Characteristics

### Public Without a Listing
An unquoted [public company](../p/public_company.md) has completed the formal process of registering as a [public company](../p/public_company.md) under relevant regulatory authorities but has chosen not to list its [shares](../s/shares.md) on any public stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md). They may instead rely on private transactions to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) or [trade](../t/trade.md) [shares](../s/shares.md). 

### Regulatory Compliance
Even though they are not [listed](../l/listed.md), these companies often still have to adhere to several regulatory requirements meant to ensure [transparency](../t/transparency.md), [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md), and [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) rights. This can include filing annual reports, holding annual general meetings (AGMs), and conforming to audit requirements. 

### Shareholder Rights
Shareholders of unquoted public companies generally [hold](../h/hold.md) the same rights as those in publicly [listed](../l/listed.md) companies, including voting on significant corporate actions, dividends, and access to certain forms of financial information.

### Liquidity and Valuation
One of the main challenges faced by shareholders in unquoted public companies is the limited [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) of [shares](../s/shares.md). Since [shares](../s/shares.md) are not traded on a public [exchange](../e/exchange.md), finding a buyer or seller can be more difficult. This often results in discounted valuations compared to similar publicly traded companies.

## Corporate Governance

Unquoted public companies are required to maintain standards of [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) similar to those expected of [listed](../l/listed.md) companies. This often includes the composition of a board of directors, the establishment of various committees (e.g., audit, [remuneration](../r/remuneration.md)), and adherence to ethical [business](../b/business.md) practices.

### Board Composition
The board of directors in an unquoted [public company](../p/public_company.md) is typically composed of both executive and non-executive members. Non-executive directors are particularly important as they provide independent oversight.

### Audit Committees
The presence of an [audit committee](../a/audit_committee.md) is often mandatory. This committee is responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process, the audit process, the company's system of [internal controls](../i/internal_controls.md), and compliance with laws and regulations.

### Remuneration Committees
A [remuneration](../r/remuneration.md) committee often exists to set appropriate [remuneration](../r/remuneration.md) levels for executive directors and to ensure that such [remuneration](../r/remuneration.md) aligns with the long-term interests of the company and its shareholders.

## Capital Raising

Without public trading of [shares](../s/shares.md), unquoted public companies must rely on other forms of [capital](../c/capital.md) raising. [Options](../o/options.md) include [private equity](../p/private_equity.md), [venture capital](../v/venture_capital.md), private placements, and sometimes initial public offerings (IPOs) directed primarily at institutional investors but not followed by a public listing.

### Private Equity
These firms often seek investments from [private equity](../p/private_equity.md) funds, which provide [capital](../c/capital.md) in [exchange](../e/exchange.md) for a stake in the company. [Private equity](../p/private_equity.md) can be advantageous as it often includes not just [capital](../c/capital.md) but also strategic [business](../b/business.md) advice and management expertise.

### Venture Capital
For unquoted public companies in their earlier stages or those in innovative sectors, [venture capital](../v/venture_capital.md) can be a suitable source of funding. Venture capitalists provide [capital](../c/capital.md) with the expectation of high returns, typically achieved through eventual [sale](../s/sale.md) or IPO.

### Private Placements
The company might [issue](../i/issue.md) [shares](../s/shares.md) privately to a select group of investors rather than through a public [offering](../o/offering.md). This can include high-net-worth individuals, institutional investors, or strategic partners.

### Directed Offerings
In some cases, an unquoted [public company](../p/public_company.md) may conduct an IPO, but instead of listing on a stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md), the [offer](../o/offer.md) is directed at institutional investors or used as an [exit strategy](../e/exit_strategy.md) for early investors.

## Examples of Unquoted Public Companies

Several well-known companies have operated as unquoted public companies at different points in their journey. It is important to consider that some organizations may toggle between [listed](../l/listed.md) and unlisted statuses based on their strategic needs.

## Legal Frameworks

### Jurisdictional Differences
The legal framework governing unquoted public companies can vary significantly between jurisdictions.

#### United States
In the U.S., SEC regulations play a significant role in dictating the terms under which a company must comply, even if it is not [listed](../l/listed.md). Reporting requirements can be stringent based on the number of shareholders and the amount of assets.

#### United Kingdom
In the UK, unquoted public companies are subject to the Companies Act 2006, which mandates compliance measures for both [listed](../l/listed.md) and unlisted public companies, including reporting and governance standards.

#### European Union
EU regulations impose cross-border standards that can affect unquoted public companies, particularly regarding [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) rights. Companies must also navigate individual member state regimes.

### Reporting and Disclosures
Regardless of the jurisdiction, unquoted public companies generally must produce annual financial reports, undergo audits, and adhere to specific [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) communication protocols.

## Pros and Cons

### Advantages
- **Control**: Founders and early-stage investors can retain significant control over corporate decisions without the same pressure from [market](../m/market.md) analysts.
- **Flexibility**: These companies are not subject to the same strict [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) requirements as publicly [listed](../l/listed.md) firms, allowing for more operational flexibility.
- **Lower Costs**: Without the need to comply with the extensive regulatory requirements of public listings, these companies can save on compliance costs.

### Disadvantages
- **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) Issues**: Lack of a public [market](../m/market.md) for [shares](../s/shares.md) can severely limit the ease with which [stocks](../s/stock.md) can be bought and sold.
- **[Valuation](../v/valuation.md) Challenges**: Determining the fair [market value](../m/market_value.md) of [shares](../s/shares.md) can be more complex and often results in discounted valuations compared to publicly [listed](../l/listed.md) peers.
- **[Capital](../c/capital.md) Raising Difficulty**: Raising [capital](../c/capital.md) can be more challenging and often rely on more expensive [financing](../f/financing.md) methods like [private equity](../p/private_equity.md) and [venture capital](../v/venture_capital.md).

## Conclusion

Unquoted public companies exist in a unique space within the corporate world. They combine the governance and regulatory oversight of public companies with the privacy and control often enjoyed by private companies. While they present certain advantages, such as lower compliance costs and increased control, they also come with significant challenges, particularly regarding [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and [capital](../c/capital.md) raising. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for stakeholders navigating their roles within or in relation to unquoted public companies.

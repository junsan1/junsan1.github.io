# Unlawful Loan

## Definition

An unlawful [loan](../l/loan.md) typically refers to any lending practice that fails to comply with legal and regulatory standards. This can include a [range](../r/range.md) of activities such as charging illegally high [interest](../i/interest.md) rates ([usury](../u/usury.md)), failing to disclose the terms properly, lending without a proper license, and predatory lending practices that take advantage of borrowers.

## Types of Unlawful Loans

### Usurious Loans

[Usury laws](../u/usury_laws.md) impose maximum limits on the amount of [interest](../i/interest.md) that can be charged on loans. Any [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) that exceeds these limits is considered usurious and hence illegal. Different jurisdictions have different caps:

- **State-specific caps:** In the U.S., each state can set its own maximum [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md).
- **Federal cap:** In some scenarios, federal laws can set limits as well, particularly for specific types of loans.

### Predatory Lending

Predatory lending involves unfair, deceptive, or fraudulent practices during the [loan](../l/loan.md) [origination](../o/origination.md) process, harming the borrower. 

- **Examples:** Excessive fees, high [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, balloon payments, and [equity](../e/equity.md) stripping.

### Unlicensed Lending

Operating a lending [business](../b/business.md) without a proper license is illegal. License requirements can vary by jurisdiction and type of [loan](../l/loan.md) offered. 

### Non-Disclosure

Lenders are required to disclose all terms and conditions of the [loan](../l/loan.md) agreement transparently. Any failure in proper [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) renders the [loan](../l/loan.md) unlawful.

## Legal Framework

### United States

1. **Truth in Lending Act (TILA):** This U.S. federal law promotes the informed use of [consumer credit](../c/consumer_credit.md) by requiring disclosures about its terms and cost.
2. **Dodd-Frank Act:** This act aims to promote financial stability by improving accountability and [transparency](../t/transparency.md) in the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md).
3. **State [Usury Laws](../u/usury_laws.md):** Various states in the U.S. set their own maximum allowable [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

### European Union

1. **[Consumer Credit](../c/consumer_credit.md) Directive:** This EU Directive ensures [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and standardized information to consumers.
2. **[Usury Laws](../u/usury_laws.md):** Each EU member can enact its own [usury laws](../u/usury_laws.md) within the overall framework.

### Asia

1. **Japan:** The [Interest Rate](../i/interest_rate.md) Restriction Act and the [Capital](../c/capital.md) Subscription Law cap [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.
2. **China:** The Supreme People's Court has guidelines on permissible [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

## Consequences

### Legal Consequences

If a [loan](../l/loan.md) is determined to be unlawful, lenders can face severe penalties including:

- **Fines:** Substantial financial penalties.
- **Revocation of License:** Loss of the ability to legally operate a lending [business](../b/business.md).
- **Restitution:** Requirement to refund excess [interest](../i/interest.md) or payments made by the borrower.

### Financial Consequences

Substantial financial risks are associated with unlawful lending including:

- **Loss of [Revenue](../r/revenue.md):** Illegal loans may be rendered null and void.
- **Operational Disruptions:** Legal issues can lead to the suspension of [business activities](../b/business_activities.md).

### Reputational Risks

### PayDay Loans

Many [payday loan](../p/payday_loan.md) companies have been prosecuted for charging exorbitantly high-[interest](../i/interest.md) rates, violating state [usury laws](../u/usury_laws.md).

## How To Avoid Unlawful Lending Practices

### Compliance

Firms need to adhere strictly to legal regulations:
- **Regular Audits:** Ensure [business](../b/business.md) practices meet existing laws.
- **Legal Counsel:** Consult with legal experts regularly.

- **Transparent Communication:** Make all [loan](../l/loan.md) terms clear before signing.

### Advocacy

Non-[profit](../p/profit.md) organizations and regulators often work to combat unlawful lending:
- **Watchdog Groups:** Organizations that monitor lending practices.
- **Regulatory Bodies:** Agencies enforcing [loan](../l/loan.md) laws.

## Conclusion

Unlawful loans pose significant risks not just to borrowers but to the stability of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

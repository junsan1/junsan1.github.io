# Unlawful Loan

## Definition

An unlawful loan typically refers to any lending practice that fails to comply with legal and regulatory standards. This can include a range of activities such as charging illegally high interest rates (usury), failing to disclose the terms properly, lending without a proper license, and predatory lending practices that take advantage of borrowers.

## Types of Unlawful Loans

### Usurious Loans

Usury laws impose maximum limits on the amount of interest that can be charged on loans. Any interest rate that exceeds these limits is considered usurious and hence illegal. Different jurisdictions have different caps:

- **State-specific caps:** In the U.S., each state can set its own maximum interest rate.
- **Federal cap:** In some scenarios, federal laws can set limits as well, particularly for specific types of loans.

### Predatory Lending

Predatory lending involves unfair, deceptive, or fraudulent practices during the loan origination process, harming the borrower. 

- **Examples:** Excessive fees, high interest rates, balloon payments, and equity stripping.

### Unlicensed Lending

Operating a lending business without a proper license is illegal. License requirements can vary by jurisdiction and type of loan offered. 

### Non-Disclosure

Lenders are required to disclose all terms and conditions of the loan agreement transparently. Any failure in proper disclosure renders the loan unlawful.

## Legal Framework

### United States

1. **Truth in Lending Act (TILA):** This U.S. federal law promotes the informed use of consumer credit by requiring disclosures about its terms and cost.
2. **Dodd-Frank Act:** This act aims to promote financial stability by improving accountability and transparency in the financial system.
3. **State Usury Laws:** Various states in the U.S. set their own maximum allowable interest rates.

### European Union

1. **Consumer Credit Directive:** This EU Directive ensures transparency and standardized information to consumers.
2. **Usury Laws:** Each EU member can enact its own usury laws within the overall framework.

### Asia

1. **Japan:** The Interest Rate Restriction Act and the Capital Subscription Law cap interest rates.
2. **China:** The Supreme People's Court has guidelines on permissible interest rates.

## Consequences

A structured approach involving strict adherence to legal guidelines, enhanced borrower education, and robust regulatory oversight is essential to prevent the proliferation of unlawful lending practices. Understanding the nuances of what constitutes an unlawful loan is critical for both lending institutions and borrowers in navigating the complex landscape of financial loans.

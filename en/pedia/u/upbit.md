Upbit is one of South Korea's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, known for its significant trading volume and extensive list of available cryptocurrencies. It was launched in October 2017 and is operated by Dunamu Inc., a prominent fintech firm in South Korea that has also ventured into various blockchain-based projects.

## Overview

Upbit quickly ascended the ranks in the cryptocurrency exchange landscape due to its user-friendly interface, robust security measures, and strategic partnerships. Within a short span of time, it became one of the leading players in the market, not just in South Korea but globally. Upbit supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies and offers multiple trading pairs, facilitating liquidity and trading flexibility for its users.

## Founding and Background

Upbit was founded by Dunamu Inc., which was established in 2012. Dunamu initially focused on developing stock trading systems before pivoting to the blockchain and cryptocurrency sector. Upon recognizing the emergent trends and the growing demand for cryptocurrency trading in South Korea, Dunamu stepped into the crypto exchange industry by launching Upbit.

One notable strategic partnership that bolstered Upbit's credibility is its collaboration with Bittrex, a popular U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange. This partnership enabled Upbit to offer a wide range of cryptocurrencies right from its inception.

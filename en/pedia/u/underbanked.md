# Underbanked

The term "underbanked" refers to individuals or households that have limited access to mainstream financial services commonly offered by traditional banks, such as checking or savings accounts, credit cards, loans, and mortgages. Despite possibly having a basic bank account, the underbanked often rely on alternative financial services like payday loans, pawnshops, money orders, and check cashing services, which can be more expensive and less secure.

## Characteristics of the Underbanked

Understanding the underbanked population involves examining several key characteristics:

### Limited Access to Financial Services

1. **Basic Accounts Only**: The underbanked typically have basic accounts such as checking or savings but do not use other financial products like credit cards, loans, or investment accounts.
2. **Alternative Financial Services**: They often rely on non-traditional financial services for their everyday needs. This can include high-cost short-term loans, check cashing services, and money transfer services.

### Demographics

1. **Income Levels**: The underbanked often belong to low-to-moderate income brackets.
2. **Geographic Location**: A significant portion of the underbanked reside in rural or underserved urban areas.
3. **Age and Education**: The underbanked population frequently includes younger adults and those with lower educational attainment.

### Reasons for Being Underbanked

1. **Lack of Trust**: Distrust in traditional banking institutions due to previous bad experiences or cultural attitudes.

# Underbanked

The term "underbanked" refers to individuals or households that have limited access to mainstream financial services commonly offered by traditional banks, such as checking or savings accounts, [credit](../c/credit.md) cards, loans, and mortgages. Despite possibly having a basic [bank](../b/bank.md) account, the underbanked often rely on alternative financial services like payday loans, pawnshops, [money](../m/money.md) orders, and [check](../c/check.md) cashing services, which can be more expensive and less secure.

2. **Alternative Financial Services**: They often rely on non-traditional financial services for their everyday needs. This can include high-cost short-term loans, [check](../c/check.md) cashing services, and [money](../m/money.md) transfer services.

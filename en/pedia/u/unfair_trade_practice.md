# Unfair Trade Practice

An unfair [trade](../t/trade.md) practice refers to any unauthorized activity or deceptive method employed by businesses that harm consumers, competitors, or violate public policy. These practices are opposed and regulated under various national and international laws to promote a fair marketplace. Unfair [trade](../t/trade.md) practices may disadvantage competitors, mislead consumers, and distort [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md). They are often categorized under anti-competitive strategies, misleading advertisements, or other unethical commercial behaviors.

## Definition

Unfair [trade](../t/trade.md) practices encompass a broad spectrum of activities considered deceitful, fraudulent, or unethical. These activities exploit consumers' [trust](../t/trust.md), making it difficult for them to make informed decisions. The Federal [Trade](../t/trade.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (FTC) in the United States defines an "unfair [trade](../t/trade.md) practice" as:

- A practice that causes or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers.
- The injury is not reasonably avoidable by consumers themselves.
- The injury is not outweighed by benefits to consumers or to competition.

Other nations have similar definitions and regulatory frameworks intended to curb the prevalence of unfair [trade](../t/trade.md) practices in their markets.

## Deceptive Methods

### 1. **Misleading Advertising**

This involves providing false, exaggerated, incomplete, or misleading information about a product or service. Misleading advertisements can take various forms:

- **False Claims**: Advertising a product as having features or benefits it does not possess.
- **Hidden Fees**: Promoting a product without disclosing additional costs that a consumer might incur.
- **[Bait and Switch](../b/bait_and_switch.md)**: Advertiser lures customers with an attractive [offer](../o/offer.md) and then persuades them to purchase a more expensive product once they are in the store or on the website.

### 2. **Predatory Pricing**

[Predatory pricing](../p/predatory_pricing.md) entails setting prices excessively low to eliminate competitors from the [market](../m/market.md) and create [monopoly](../m/monopoly.md)-like conditions. It usually involves selling products below cost for an extended period, causing financial strain on existing or new competitors:

- **Below-Cost Pricing**: Selling products at a loss with the strategic intent to drive competitors out.
- **Recoupment Strategy**: After competitors are eliminated, raising prices significantly to recover losses.

### 3. **Exclusive Dealing and Tying Arrangements**

Exclusive dealing occurs when a supplier insists that the [dealer](../d/dealer.md) only buys their goods and not those of competitors. [Tying](../t/tying.md) arrangement is when a [customer](../c/customer.md) is forced to buy a secondary product as a condition of purchasing a desired primary product:

- **Exclusive Contracts**: Contracts obliging businesses to buy only from the supplier, restricting [market](../m/market.md) competition.
- **Bundling**: Requiring customers to buy combined products instead of individually, reducing consumer choice.

### 4. **Misrepresentation and Fraud**

Misrepresentation involves deliberately providing incorrect or misleading information about the nature, quality, or state of a product:

- **Product Quality**: Misleading customers about the quality, origin, or ingredients of the product.
- **False Endorsements**: Using fake testimonials or endorsements to enhance credibility falsely.

### 5. **Counterfeiting and Trademark Infringements**

This entails producing or selling imitation products without authorization, often leading to consumer deception and potential harm:

- **Fake Goods**: Selling counterfeit products as genuine, impacting brand reputation and consumer [trust](../t/trust.md).
- **[Trademark](../t/trademark.md) Violation**: Unauthorized use of another brand's name, symbol, or [trade](../t/trade.md) dress to mislead consumers.

## Examples

# Usury

Usury is the practice of lending [money](../m/money.md) at an unreasonably high-[interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md). Historically, usury has been considered a socially and morally dubious practice, often condemned by religious doctrines, social norms, and, over time, regulatory measures in many jurisdictions.

## Historical Context

### Ancient Times

Usury is a concept that traces back to ancient civilizations. For example, both ancient Mesopotamia and Greece had regulations regarding the practice. The Code of Hammurabi, one of the earliest known legal codes, prohibited the charging of excessive [interest](../i/interest.md). Similarly, in ancient Greece, the philosopher Aristotle condemned the practice, arguing that it was unnatural since [money](../m/money.md) itself is sterile and does not naturally produce more [money](../m/money.md).

### Religious Views

#### Christianity

In Christianity, particularly during the medieval period, usury was denounced by various religious authorities. The Catholic Church, for instance, prohibited the charging of [interest](../i/interest.md), considering it sinful. Theological debates centered on the idea that [money](../m/money.md) was a [medium of exchange](../m/medium_of_exchange.md), not a [commodity](../c/commodity.md) to be rented out at [interest](../i/interest.md).

#### Islam

In Islam, usury is known as "riba" and is explicitly condemned by the Quran. Islamic [finance](../f/finance.md) has developed various structures that comply with Sharia law to avoid the concept of riba, including [profit](../p/profit.md)-sharing schemes and leasing agreements.

#### Judaism

Judaism also has laws against usury, particularly among the community. The Torah warns against charging [interest](../i/interest.md) to fellow Jews, although lending to non-Jews with [interest](../i/interest.md) was more permissible.

## Legal Regulations

### Modern Day

Today's regulatory landscape surrounding usury varies significantly from country to country. In the U.S, each state has different rules regarding what constitutes usury, with some states setting caps on [interest](../i/interest.md) rates for consumer loans. The federal government also imposes regulations that prevent predatory lending practices. Similarly, the [European Union](../e/european_union_(eu).md) has [usury laws](../u/usury_laws.md) incorporated within broader consumer protection laws.

## Economic Implications

### Lending and Borrowing

High-[interest](../i/interest.md) rates fundamentally impact both the [lender](../l/lender.md) and borrower. For lenders, high-[interest](../i/interest.md) rates represent higher returns on their [capital](../c/capital.md). However, for borrowers, usurious rates can lead to a cycle of [debt](../d/debt.md) that is difficult to escape. This dynamic can have widespread economic implications, including exacerbating [income inequality](../i/income_inequality.md) and leading to financial instability.

### Impact on Markets

In [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), the availability of [credit](../c/credit.md) at reasonable [interest](../i/interest.md) rates is crucial for [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md). High [interest](../i/interest.md) rates can stifle investment by making borrowing too costly for businesses, thus hampering economic activity. On the other hand, too low [interest](../i/interest.md) rates can lead to overheating in economies, fueling [asset](../a/asset.md) [bubbles](../b/bubble.md). Central banks play a crucial role in maintaining a balance to avoid these extremes.

## Contemporary Usury Practices

### Payday Loans

One common example of modern usury is payday loans. Payday lenders [offer](../o/offer.md) short-term, high-[interest](../i/interest.md) loans intended to cover the borrower until their next paycheck. The annual [interest](../i/interest.md) rates on these loans can sometimes exceed 400%, leading to significant criticism and calls for regulatory reforms.

### Credit Cards

Another area of concern is [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) [debt](../d/debt.md). While [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) companies provide consumers with the convenience of [credit](../c/credit.md), they often charge high-[interest](../i/interest.md) rates on outstanding balances. These rates, coupled with fees and penalties, can lead to usurious terms for consumers who cannot pay off their balances promptly.

## Ethical Considerations

### Moral Debates

The morality of charging high-[interest](../i/interest.md) rates has been a topic of debate throughout history. Critics argue that usury exploits borrowers in need, often leading to severe financial hardship. Proponents may argue that higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates reflect the [risk](../r/risk.md) involved in lending to less [credit](../c/credit.md)-worthy individuals. The ethical balance between [risk](../r/risk.md) and exploitation continues to be a contentious [issue](../i/issue.md).

### Corporate Responsibility

In the contemporary [business](../b/business.md) landscape, companies [offering](../o/offering.md) financial services must navigate the ethical implications of their lending practices. Transparent communication of terms, fair lending practices, and initiatives for financial education are steps companies can take to mitigate the negative impact of potentially usurious practices.

## Usury and Technology

### FinTech Solutions

The rise of Financial Technology (FinTech) companies has introduced new dynamics to the question of usury. Platforms like [peer-to-peer lending](../p/peer-to-peer_lending.md) and digital banks aim to [offer](../o/offer.md) more transparent and competitive [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. However, the [risk](../r/risk.md) of innovation in lending also introduces new challenges, such as ensuring that these platforms do not perpetuate or even exacerbate usurious practices.

For instance, platforms like LendingClub [visit LendingClub](https://www.lendingclub.com) and Funding Circle [visit Funding Circle](https://www.fundingcircle.com) aim to [offer](../o/offer.md) more favorable [loan](../l/loan.md) terms by leveraging technology, thereby reducing costs and potentially [offering](../o/offering.md) lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

## Usury in the Global Context

### Developing Economies

In many developing economies, access to traditional banking services is limited, leading individuals to turn to informal lending practices, which can often be usurious. [Microfinance](../m/microfinance.md) institutions, which traditionally [offer](../o/offer.md) small loans at higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, have been both praised for providing [capital](../c/capital.md) to underserved populations and criticized for their high-[interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

### Regulatory Challenges

[Globalization](../g/globalization.md) and the internet have made it more difficult to regulate lending practices consistently. Some lenders operate across borders, taking advantage of regulatory loopholes in different jurisdictions. International efforts to standardize regulatory practices are ongoing but face challenges due to varying [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md) and legal frameworks.

## Conclusion

Usury, as a practice and concept, has evolved significantly over time. From its historical roots in ancient civilizations and religious condemnations to contemporary challenges posed by modern financial systems and technological innovations, the [issue](../i/issue.md) remains deeply relevant. Balancing the benefits of providing [credit](../c/credit.md) with the need to prevent exploitation through excessive [interest](../i/interest.md) rates continues to be a central challenge for regulators, lenders, and society as a whole.

# Use Tax

Use tax is a tax levied on the consumption, use, or storage of goods in a state where the goods were not purchased. This tax is complementary to [sales tax](../s/sales_tax.md) and is designed to ensure that transactions that escape the [sales tax](../s/sales_tax.md), primarily those made out-of-state or online, still contribute tax [revenue](../r/revenue.md) to the state where the goods are ultimately utilized.

## Understanding Use Tax

Use tax serves as a counterpart to [sales tax](../s/sales_tax.md). When consumers or businesses purchase goods or services from out-of-state vendors, they often do not pay the [sales tax](../s/sales_tax.md) of their [home](../h/home.md) state. To account for this, states have implemented use tax rules. This ensures that they collect [revenue](../r/revenue.md) on goods that are used, stored, or consumed within their jurisdiction.

### Characteristics of Use Tax

1. **Tax Jurisdiction**: The use tax applies to the state where the product is used, stored, or consumed.
2. **[Complement](../c/complement.md) to [Sales Tax](../s/sales_tax.md)**: It is meant to serve as a balance where [sales tax](../s/sales_tax.md) cannot be applied.
3. **Rate Consistency**: In many locations, the use [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md) is identical to the local [sales tax](../s/sales_tax.md) rate.
4. **Self-Reporting**: Businesses and individuals are responsible for self-assessing and remitting use tax.

### Implementation

When a consumer or [business](../b/business.md) purchases goods from outside their state, they may receive the product without paying [sales tax](../s/sales_tax.md) to the vendor's state. Upon bringing the product into their [home](../h/home.md) state, they are required to calculate and pay the equivalent use tax.

### Common Scenarios

1. **Online Purchases**: With the rise of e-[commerce](../c/commerce.md), goods bought from online retailers often escape state [sales tax](../s/sales_tax.md), prompting the need for use tax.
2. **[Business](../b/business.md) Purchases**: Companies frequently purchase equipment and supplies from out-of-state vendors. The use tax ensures they contribute tax [revenue](../r/revenue.md) in the state where these items are consumed.
3. **Interstate Transactions**: When a product is purchased in a state with no [sales tax](../s/sales_tax.md) and brought into a state with [sales tax](../s/sales_tax.md), the use tax is applied.

### Compliance

Enforcement of use tax can be challenging since it relies heavily on self-reporting. To encourage compliance:

- **Audit Mechanisms**: States may audit businesses to ensure use tax [obligations](../o/obligation.md) are met.
- **Educational Campaigns**: Informing taxpayers about use tax responsibilities can improve compliance.

## Business Implications

Businesses are particularly impacted by use tax as they frequently engage in interstate purchases. To manage their use tax [obligations](../o/obligation.md) effectively, businesses should:

1. **Maintain Records**: Keep detailed records of all purchases made from out-of-state vendors.
2. **Integrate Tax Software**: Use tax calculation and [remittance](../r/remittance.md) can be automated through specialized software solutions.
3. **Employee Training**: Ensure that employees involved in [procurement](../p/procurement.md) are aware of use tax requirements.

### Use Tax Management Solutions

Several software solutions aid businesses in managing their use tax responsibilities. These tools can automate calculations, integrate with existing [accounting](../a/accounting.md) systems, and facilitate [remittance](../r/remittance.md) processes. Examples of such software include:

## Challenges and Controversies

Use tax compliance remains a contentious [issue](../i/issue.md) for several reasons:

- **Complexity**: Interaction between different state tax codes can complicate compliance.
- **Enforcement**: Difficulty in enforcing self-reported [taxes](../t/taxes.md) can lead to significant under-collection.
- **Evolving E-[commerce](../c/commerce.md)**: The rapid growth of online shopping has outpaced traditional tax collection methods, making it harder to capture all taxable transactions.

### Legal Developments

Legal frameworks surrounding use tax are evolving. A notable case is South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. (2018), where the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states could require online retailers to remit use tax, even if they lack a physical presence in the state. This decision has broad implications, propelling changes in state tax laws and increasing compliance [obligations](../o/obligation.md) for online retailers.

## Conclusion

Use tax plays a critical role in ensuring fair tax collection on interstate transactions. As [commerce](../c/commerce.md) continues to globalize and shift online, businesses and individuals must stay informed of their use tax [obligations](../o/obligation.md) and utilize tools and strategies to maintain compliance. Enforcing and adapting use tax regulations [will](../w/will.md) remain a dynamic challenge for policymakers and tax authorities.

# Understanding Business Expenses and Which Are Tax Deductible

Understanding [business](../b/business.md) expenses and determining which ones are tax-deductible is crucial for entrepreneurs and established [business](../b/business.md) owners alike. This knowledge directly impacts the [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) of a [business](../b/business.md) by optimizing [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md) and ensuring compliance with tax laws. This comprehensive guide [will](../w/will.md) delve into the different types of [business](../b/business.md) expenses, the criteria for [tax deduction](../t/tax_deduction.md), and examples to illustrate deductible and non-deductible expenses.

## What Are Business Expenses?

[Business](../b/business.md) expenses are the costs that a company incurs during its normal operations to generate [revenue](../r/revenue.md). These expenses can be fixed or variable and may include costs related to production, [marketing](../m/marketing.md), employees, and more. Understanding and accurately tracking these expenses is essential for effective financial management and compliance with tax regulations.

### Types of Business Expenses

1. **Operating Expenses:** These are the day-to-day expenses necessary to run a [business](../b/business.md). They include rent, utilities, office supplies, and salaries.
2. **[Capital](../c/capital.md) Expenses:** These are costs related to purchasing or improving [long-term assets](../l/long-term_assets.md) such as buildings, equipment, or vehicles.
3. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):** This refers to the direct costs associated with the production of goods sold by the company, including materials and labor.
4. **Personal Expenses:** These are costs incurred by the [business](../b/business.md) owner that are personal rather than [business](../b/business.md)-related.
   
## Criteria for Tax Deductions

To qualify for a [tax deduction](../t/tax_deduction.md), an [expense](../e/expense.md) must meet specific criteria set by the Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Service (IRS) or the relevant tax authority in a given country. Generally, [business](../b/business.md) expenses must be both ordinary and necessary.

### Ordinary and Necessary

- **Ordinary Expenses:** These are common and accepted in your [trade](../t/trade.md) or [business](../b/business.md). For example, if you own a bakery, purchasing flour would be considered an ordinary [expense](../e/expense.md).
- **Necessary Expenses:** These are helpful and appropriate for your [business](../b/business.md). They don't have to be indispensable, but they should be appropriate for the operation of your [business](../b/business.md).

### Other Criteria

1. **Directly Related to [Business](../b/business.md):** The [expense](../e/expense.md) must be directly connected to your [business](../b/business.md) operations. This means personal expenditures generally aren't deductible.
2. **Proper Documentation:** Accurate records and [receipts](../r/receipt.md) must be kept to support the [expense](../e/expense.md). Without proper documentation, deductions may be disallowed.

### Example 4: Non-Deductible Expense - Political Donations
A [business](../b/business.md) donates $1,000 to a political campaign, and this amount is non-deductible as political contributions generally do not qualify for tax deductions.

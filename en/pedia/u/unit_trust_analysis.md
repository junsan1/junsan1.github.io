# Unit Trust Analysis

[Unit Trusts](../u/unit_trusts.md), also known as mutual funds, are collective investment schemes designed to pool [capital](../c/capital.md) from [multiple](../m/multiple.md) investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of securities. This investment approach allows individual investors to [gain](../g/gain.md) access to a [wide variety](../w/wide_variety.md) of [asset](../a/asset.md) classes which they might not be able to invest in directly due to lack of [capital](../c/capital.md), knowledge, or resources. [Unit Trusts](../u/unit_trusts.md) are managed by professional [fund](../f/fund.md) managers who allocate the [pooled funds](../p/pooled_funds.md) according to the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s stated objectives and strategies.

## Structure and Mechanisms

A Unit [Trust](../t/trust.md) is structured as an [open](../o/open.md)-ended [investment vehicle](../i/investment_vehicle.md), meaning that the [fund](../f/fund.md) can continually [issue](../i/issue.md) and redeem units based on [investor](../i/investor.md) [demand](../d/demand.md). Each [investor](../i/investor.md) holds units in the [trust](../t/trust.md) proportional to their investment, and the [value](../v/value.md) of these units fluctuates based on the performance of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets.

### Key Components

**1. [Fund Manager](../f/fund_manager.md)**: A professionally trained individual or management [firm](../f/firm.md) responsible for making investment decisions, conducting research, and optimizing the portfolio. [Fund](../f/fund.md) managers are typically experienced in the [asset](../a/asset.md) classes they manage and employ various strategies to achieve the [fund](../f/fund.md)’s objectives.

**2. [Trust Deed](../t/trust_deed.md)**: A legal document that outlines the [fund](../f/fund.md)’s objectives, rules, and regulations. It includes information about the roles and responsibilities of the [trustee](../t/trustee.md) and the [fund manager](../f/fund_manager.md), the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s investment parameters, and other operational aspects.

**3. [Trustee](../t/trustee.md)**: An independent entity responsible for safeguarding the [fund](../f/fund.md)’s assets and ensuring compliance with the [trust deed](../t/trust_deed.md). The [trustee](../t/trustee.md) acts in the best interests of the investors and often performs auditing and regulatory compliance tasks.

**4. [Custodian](../c/custodian.md)**: A financial institution that holds the [fund](../f/fund.md)’s securities and other assets in safekeeping. The [custodian](../c/custodian.md) ensures the assets are properly accounted for and helps in the smooth [transaction](../t/transaction.md) process.

**5. Unitholders**: Investors who pool their [money](../m/money.md) into the Unit [Trust](../t/trust.md). They [hold](../h/hold.md) units in the proportion of their investment and benefit from the [fund](../f/fund.md)’s performance through [capital](../c/capital.md) gains and dividends.

### Mechanisms and Valuation

The [value](../v/value.md) of a unit in a Unit [Trust](../t/trust.md) is known as the Net [Asset](../a/asset.md) [Value](../v/value.md) (NAV), which is calculated by dividing the total [value](../v/value.md) of the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s assets, minus any liabilities, by the number of units in circulation. NAV is typically calculated at the end of each trading day.

## Types of Unit Trusts

[Unit Trusts](../u/unit_trusts.md) can invest in various [asset](../a/asset.md) classes and instruments based on their designated objectives. Some common types include:

**1. [Equity](../e/equity.md) Funds**: These funds invest primarily in [stocks](../s/stock.md) and are aimed at generating [capital](../c/capital.md) appreciation over the medium to long-term. They can be further classified into large-cap, [mid-cap](../m/mid-cap.md), and small-cap funds based on the [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) of the companies they invest in.

**2. Fixed-[Income](../i/income.md) Funds**: Also known as [bond](../b/bond.md) funds, they invest in government and corporate bonds to provide regular [income](../i/income.md) to investors. These funds tend to be less volatile than [equity](../e/equity.md) funds and are often preferred by conservative investors seeking steady returns.

**3. Balanced Funds**: These funds aim to provide a blend of growth and [income](../i/income.md) by [investing](../i/investing.md) in both equities and fixed-[income](../i/income.md) securities. They [offer](../o/offer.md) a balance between [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md) and are suitable for investors with a moderate [risk](../r/risk.md) appetite.

**4. [Money Market](../m/money_market.md) Funds**: These funds invest in [short-term debt](../s/short-term_debt.md) instruments such as treasury bills, certificates of [deposit](../d/deposit.md), and [commercial paper](../c/commercial_paper.md). They aim to provide high [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) with low [risk](../r/risk.md) and are often used for parking [surplus](../s/surplus.md) funds for short durations.

**5. [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) Funds**: These funds replicate the performance of a specific [market index](../m/market_index.md), such as the S&P 500. They [offer](../o/offer.md) broad [market exposure](../m/market_exposure.md), low operating expenses, and passively managed returns that mirror the [index](../i/index_instrument.md)’s performance.

**6. Sector Funds**: These funds focus on specific sectors or industries, such as technology, healthcare, or energy. They carry higher [risk](../r/risk.md) due to their narrow focus but can [offer](../o/offer.md) substantial returns if the sector performs well.

**7. International Funds**: These funds invest in securities from global markets outside of the [investor](../i/investor.md)’s [home](../h/home.md) country. They provide [diversification benefits](../d/diversification_benefits.md) but also come with [currency](../c/currency.md) and geopolitical risks.

## Performance and Analysis

### Evaluating Performance

Evaluating the performance of [Unit Trusts](../u/unit_trusts.md) involves assessing both qualitative and quantitative factors. Here are some metrics and considerations:

**1. Historical Performance**: Examining the [fund](../f/fund.md)’s [historical returns](../h/historical_returns.md) compared to its [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) and peers. It includes analyzing annual returns, compounded annual growth rate (CAGR), and [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted returns.

**2. [Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: Analyzing the [fund](../f/fund.md)’s [volatility](../v/volatility.md) through [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) and [beta](../b/beta.md). A higher [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) indicates greater [volatility](../v/volatility.md), while [beta](../b/beta.md) measures the [fund](../f/fund.md)’s sensitivity to [market](../m/market.md) movements.

**3. [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md)**: This ratio measures the [risk-adjusted return](../r/risk-adjusted_return.md) of a [fund](../f/fund.md). A higher [Sharpe ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) indicates that the [fund](../f/fund.md) has provided higher returns for a given level of [risk](../r/risk.md).

**4. [Expense Ratio](../e/expense_ratio.md)**: The annual [fee](../f/fee.md) charged by the [fund](../f/fund.md) for management and operating expenses. Lower [expense](../e/expense.md) ratios are preferable as they do not erode returns significantly.

**5. [Portfolio Turnover](../p/portfolio_turnover.md)**: Indicates the frequency with which the [fund](../f/fund.md)’s [holdings](../h/holdings.md) are traded. High [turnover](../t/turnover.md) may lead to higher [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md) and can impact returns.

**6. Manager Tenure**: The period for which the current [fund manager](../f/fund_manager.md) has been managing the [fund](../f/fund.md). Consistent and long-tenured managers with a proven track record are generally preferred.

**7. [Investment Strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md)**: Understanding the [fund](../f/fund.md)’s investment philosophy, strategy, and processes. This qualitative assessment helps in aligning the [fund](../f/fund.md)’s objectives with the [investor](../i/investor.md)’s goals.

**8. [Distribution Yield](../d/distribution_yield.md)**: Measures the [income](../i/income.md) generated by the [fund](../f/fund.md) in the form of dividends or [interest](../i/interest.md) payments, usually expressed as a percentage of NAV.

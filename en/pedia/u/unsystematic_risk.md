# Unsystematic Risk

Unsystematic [risk](../r/risk.md), also known as specific [risk](../r/risk.md), [idiosyncratic risk](../i/idiosyncratic_risk.md), or diversifiable [risk](../r/risk.md), refers to the [risk](../r/risk.md) that is unique to a particular company or [industry](../i/industry.md). This type of [risk](../r/risk.md) can be mitigated through [diversification](../d/diversification.md), unlike [systematic risk](../s/systematic_risk.md) which affects the entire [market](../m/market.md) or [economy](../e/economy.md). Unsystematic [risk](../r/risk.md) arises from factors that can impact an individual company or a small group of companies, such as management decisions, product recalls, regulatory changes, competitive pressures, and [business](../b/business.md) model failures.

Understanding unsystematic [risk](../r/risk.md) is crucial for investors, portfolio managers, and financial analysts as it plays a significant role in [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) and [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md). This topic covers the various facets of unsystematic [risk](../r/risk.md), including its sources, methods to measure and analyze it, and strategies for mitigation.

## Sources of Unsystematic Risk

1. **[Business Risk](../b/business_risk.md)**: This originates from the operational and management decisions within a company. For instance, the success of a new product launch, the [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) of operations, and the competency of management can all influence [business risk](../b/business_risk.md).
   
2. **[Financial Risk](../f/financial_risk.md)**: This is associated with a company's [financial structure](../f/financial_structure.md) and funding activities. High levels of [debt](../d/debt.md) or poor financial practices can lead to increased [financial risk](../f/financial_risk.md).
   
3. **[Operational Risk](../o/operational_risk.md)**: This involves failures in internal processes, people, and systems. Examples include technical failures, [fraud](../f/fraud.md), or [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md) disruptions.
   
4. **Legal [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: Changes in regulations, litigation, or compliance issues can create legal [risk](../r/risk.md) impacting a company's performance.
   
5. **Sectoral [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: This is specific to the [industry](../i/industry.md) or sector a company operates in. For instance, technological advancements in the tech [industry](../i/industry.md) or [commodity](../c/commodity.md) price changes in the [energy sector](../e/energy_sector.md).

## Measuring Unsystematic Risk

Unsystematic [risk](../r/risk.md) can be measured using various financial metrics and analytical tools. Key measures include:

1. **[Standard Deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md)**: It measures the [volatility](../v/volatility.md) of a company's stock returns and can indicate how much unsystematic [risk](../r/risk.md) is associated with a particular stock.
   
2. **[Beta](../b/beta.md)**: While [beta](../b/beta.md) is typically used to measure [systematic risk](../s/systematic_risk.md), it can also inform about a stockâ€™s [risk](../r/risk.md) relative to the [market](../m/market.md). A lower [beta](../b/beta.md) indicates that a stock has lower [market risk](../m/market_risk.md) but could have higher unsystematic [risk](../r/risk.md).
   
3. **[Alpha](../a/alpha.md)**: This measures the [excess return](../e/excess_return.md) on an investment relative to the [return](../r/return.md) of a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [index](../i/index.md). A high [alpha](../a/alpha.md) can indicate higher unsystematic [risk](../r/risk.md) due to reliance on unique factors.

4. **[Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md)**: While it primarily measures [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted returns, a lower [Sharpe ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) may signal the presence of higher unsystematic [risk](../r/risk.md).

## Analyzing Unsystematic Risk

Analyzing unsystematic [risk](../r/risk.md) involves qualitative and quantitative methods to understand the unique risks associated with a company or [industry](../i/industry.md).

1. **[Qualitative Analysis](../q/qualitative_analysis.md)**: This includes examining company reports, [industry](../i/industry.md) news, management discussions, and regulatory filings to understand non-quantifiable risks.
   
2. **[Quantitative Analysis](../q/quantitative_analysis.md)**: This involves statistical analysis, [financial modeling](../f/financial_modeling.md), and the use of tools like Monte Carlo simulations to predict the impact of specific risks on a company's performance.
   
3. **[Scenario Analysis](../s/scenario_analysis.md)**: This method involves constructing various hypothetical scenarios to assess potential outcomes and impacts on company performance.

4. **[Stress Testing](../s/stress_testing.md)**: Stress tests simulate extreme conditions to evaluate a company's resilience to adverse situations, highlighting unsystematic risks.

## Mitigating Unsystematic Risk

[Diversification](../d/diversification.md) is the primary strategy for mitigating unsystematic [risk](../r/risk.md). By holding a varied portfolio of investments, the impact of any single investment's failure is minimized. Other strategies include:

1. **[Asset Allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md)**: Spreading investments across different [asset](../a/asset.md) classes ([stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), etc.) to reduce exposure to any single category.
   
2. **[Industry](../i/industry.md) [Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: [Investing](../i/investing.md) in various industries and sectors to avoid concentration in a single field.
   
3. **[Geographical Diversification](../g/geographical_diversification.md)**: [Investing](../i/investing.md) in different geographic regions to mitigate risks associated with a particular country or region.
   
4. **Hedging**: Using financial instruments like [options](../o/options.md), [futures](../f/futures.md), and [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) to [offset](../o/offset.md) potential losses.
   
5. **[Active Management](../a/active_management.md)**: Regular monitoring and adjusting the investment portfolio in response to changing [market](../m/market.md) conditions and company performance.
   
## Practical Examples of Unsystematic Risk

1. **Company-Specific Events**: Events such as a product recall by a prominent automobile manufacturer, like Toyota's recall of millions of vehicles due to safety issues, which can significantly impact the company's stock price.
   
2. **Management Decisions**: Changes in senior management or strategic decisions like mergers and acquisitions can create unsystematic [risk](../r/risk.md). For instance, Elon Musk's management decisions at Tesla (https://www.tesla.com/) significantly impact its stock price.
   
3. **Litigation**: Legal challenges, such as [patent](../p/patent.md) disputes in the pharmaceutical [industry](../i/industry.md), can create substantial unsystematic [risk](../r/risk.md). An example is the litigation faced by Johnson & Johnson (https://www.jnj.com/) over product safety concerns.
   
4. **Regulatory Changes**: Regulatory impacts on specific industries, like the financial regulations imposed on banks which can influence their [operational risk](../o/operational_risk.md).

## Conclusion

Unsystematic [risk](../r/risk.md) is an integral aspect of [portfolio management](../p/par.md) and investment decision-making. By understanding its sources, measuring and analyzing it appropriately, and employing effective mitigation strategies, investors and financial managers can better manage and reduce the impact of risks that are unique to specific companies or industries. [Diversification](../d/diversification.md) remains the most potent tool against unsystematic [risk](../r/risk.md), promoting stability and resilience in investment portfolios.

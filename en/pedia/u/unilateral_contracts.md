# Unilateral Contracts

A unilateral contract is a legally binding agreement in which one party makes a promise to do or refrain from doing something in [return](../r/return.md) for the performance of an act by another party. Unlike bilateral contracts, where both parties [exchange](../e/exchange.md) mutual promises, unilateral contracts are distinct in obligating only one party to perform the terms of the contract once the other party completes a specified action. In the realm of [finance](../f/finance.md) and trading, unilateral contracts can play a significant role in various transactions, including [options](../o/options.md) trading, promotions, and rewards schemes.

## Characteristics of Unilateral Contracts

### Promise for Act

A unilateral contract involves a promise in [return](../r/return.md) for a specific act. The contract is formed not when the promise is made, but when the act required is completed. For example, a company might [offer](../o/offer.md) a reward for the recovery of lost property. In this situation, a contract is formed only when someone returns the lost property.

### Binding Obligation

The promise in a unilateral contract becomes enforceable when the specified act is performed. Before performance, the [offer](../o/offer.md) can be revoked. However, once the act begins, the offeror may be bound by the terms of the contract. For instance, in the case of an [options](../o/options.md) trading scenario, the contract binds the seller to honor the contract terms once the option buyer decides to perform the action by exercising the option.

### Application in Trading and Finance

#### Options Trading

One typical example of a unilateral contract in trading is an [options contract](../o/options_contract.md). An [options contract](../o/options_contract.md) gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an [asset](../a/asset.md) at a predetermined price before or at the expiry date. The seller of the option (option [writer](../w/writer.md)) is obligated to execute the terms of the contract if the holder decides to [exercise](../e/exercise.md) the option.

For example, a [call option](../c/call_option.md) gives the buyer the right to purchase an [asset](../a/asset.md) at a specified [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) within a certain period. The buyer pays a [premium](../p/premium.md) upfront for this right. If the buyer chooses to [exercise](../e/exercise.md) the option by purchasing the [asset](../a/asset.md) when the [market price](../m/market_price.md) exceeds the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md), the seller must deliver the [asset](../a/asset.md) at the agreed price. Here, the seller's obligation arises only when the buyer opts to [exercise](../e/exercise.md) the option, demonstrating the principle of a unilateral contract.

#### Rewards and Incentive Programs

Many companies use unilateral contracts in their promotional strategies. For example, a [firm](../f/firm.md) might announce a reward for customers who achieve a certain performance target, such as reaching a particular sales [volume](../v/volume.md). This type of contract is only enforceable when the [customer](../c/customer.md) meets the required target, after which the company is obligated to fulfill the promise (e.g., providing a reward).

Consider the case of a financial institution [offering](../o/offering.md) a referral bonus. The institution promises to give a certain amount of [money](../m/money.md) to customers who refer new clients. This contract becomes binding only when the [customer](../c/customer.md) successfully brings in a new client.

#### Insurance Policies

In some instances, [insurance](../i/insurance.md) contracts can exhibit characteristics of unilateral contracts. For example, a [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policy where the insurer promises to pay a [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md) upon the death of the insured can be viewed as unilateral. The insured pays premiums, and the insurer is only obligated to make the [payment](../p/payment.md) upon the occurrence of the specified event (the death of the insured). This condition highlights the performative nature characterizing unilateral contracts.

## Legal Implications

### Formation and Offer

The formation of a unilateral contract hinges on the performance of the specified act. The [offer](../o/offer.md) must be clear and unambiguous to form a valid unilateral contract. Courts interpret such offers objectively to determine whether an [offer](../o/offer.md) existed and if the performance meets the criteria set forth in the contract.

### Consideration and Performance

Performance serves as the consideration in a unilateral contract, making it enforceable. When the offered performance is executed, the promisor is bound by the terms of the [offer](../o/offer.md). It is essential that the performance strictly adheres to the [offer](../o/offer.md)'s terms for the contract to be binding. Any deviation could mean the contract may not come into force.

### Revocation of Offer

A crucial aspect of unilateral contracts is the offeror's ability to revoke the [offer](../o/offer.md). Generally, the [offer](../o/offer.md) can be revoked before the performance has commenced. However, once the offeree begins the act of performance, many jurisdictions restrict the offeror from revoking the [offer](../o/offer.md), ensuring fairness and preventing any potential exploitation of the offeree's efforts. Some legal systems recognize partial performance as creating an irrevocable [offer](../o/offer.md), enforcing the contract terms once part performance has occurred.

### Enforcement and Remedies

The breach of a unilateral contract, particularly when the act has been performed, entitles the aggrieved party to seek remedies. Such remedies can include specific performance, requiring the promisor to fulfill their promise, or damages compensating the offeree for any loss incurred due to the breach.

## Practical Examples

### Commercial and Advertising

Unilateral contracts often appear in commercial settings, particularly in advertising and [marketing](../m/marketing.md) campaigns. For example, a retailer might advertise a limited-time promotion [offering](../o/offering.md) a [gift card](../g/gift_card.md) to the first 100 customers who make a purchase above a certain amount. The contract is only binding when the customers fulfill the purchase conditions, obligating the retailer to provide the promised [gift card](../g/gift_card.md).

### Competitive Challenges

Competitions and challenges frequently use unilateral contracts. A company might [issue](../i/issue.md) a challenge, such as solving a complex problem with a financial reward for the first person who finds the solution. The contract is formed when the participant successfully solves the problem, obligating the company to pay the reward.

### Employment and Recruitment

Employers sometimes use unilateral contracts in job recruitment and retention strategies, promising bonuses or rewards on the completion of specific goals or milestones. For example, a mid-size [firm](../f/firm.md) may [offer](../o/offer.md) a signing bonus to new employees, payable after they complete a defined probation period. Upon successful completion, the contract obligates the employer to pay the promised bonus.

## Conclusion

Unilateral contracts play a significant role in various financial and commercial contexts. They [offer](../o/offer.md) flexibility as they involve binding [obligations](../o/obligation.md) only upon the completion of a specified act, allowing for a [range](../r/range.md) of creative and strategic uses in trading, [marketing](../m/marketing.md), and contractual agreements. Understanding the characteristics, legal implications, and practical applications of unilateral contracts enables businesses and individuals to effectively use and navigate these agreements within the financial landscape.

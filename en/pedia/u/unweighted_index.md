# Unweighted Index

An unweighted [index](../i/index_instrument.md), also known as an equal-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md), is a type of stock [market index](../m/market_index.md) where each component stock is given equal importance regardless of its [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md). Unlike a [market](../m/market.md)-[capitalization](../c/capitalization.md)-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md), where larger companies have a more significant impact on the [index](../i/index_instrument.md)'s performance, an unweighted [index](../i/index_instrument.md) treats each stock equally. This provides a different perspective on the [market](../m/market.md)'s performance and can influence investment strategies and [portfolio management](../p/par.md).

## Understanding Unweighted Indexes

In a traditional [market](../m/market.md)-[capitalization](../c/capitalization.md)-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md), the price movements of [large-cap stocks](../l/large_cap_stocks.md) dominate the [index](../i/index_instrument.md)'s performance. For instance, in the S&P 500, companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon carry much more weight than smaller companies. This means that the performance of the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) is highly dependent on the performance of these large companies.

In contrast, an unweighted [index](../i/index_instrument.md) assigns the same weight to every component stock. This means that a 1% change in the stock price of a small company has the same impact on the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) as a 1% change in the stock price of a large company. This can provide a more balanced view of the [market](../m/market.md)'s overall performance and can be particularly useful for investors looking to diversify their portfolios.

## Examples of Unweighted Indexes

### Value Line Geometric Index

One of the most well-known unweighted indexes is the [Value](../v/value.md) Line Geometric [Index](../i/index_instrument.md). This [index](../i/index_instrument.md) includes around 1,700 [stocks](../s/stock.md) from various industries and is calculated using a geometric average. Unlike arithmetic averages, which simply sum the values and divide by the number of observations, geometric averages multiply the values and take the nth root (where n is the number of observations). This type of averaging can provide a more accurate reflection of compound returns over time.

### S&P Equal Weight Index

The S&P [Equal Weight](../e/equal_weight.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) is another example. It includes the same [stocks](../s/stock.md) as the S&P 500 but assigns each stock an [equal weight](../e/equal_weight.md). This ensures that the performance of smaller companies significantly influences the [index](../i/index_instrument.md)'s overall performance, providing a different perspective compared to the traditional S&P 500.

### Museum of American Finance's NYSE Arca Equal Weighted Index

This [index](../i/index_instrument.md) covers a variety of sectors and ensures [equal weight](../e/equal_weight.md) across its component [stocks](../s/stock.md). It offers a diversified view of the [market](../m/market.md) and reduces the [risk](../r/risk.md) of overexposure to any single stock or sector.

## Benefits of Unweighted Indexes

### Diversification

One of the primary benefits of unweighted indexes is [diversification](../d/diversification.md). By giving [equal weight](../e/equal_weight.md) to all component [stocks](../s/stock.md), these indexes reduce the influence of [large-cap stocks](../l/large_cap_stocks.md) and provide more balanced exposure to small and [mid-cap stocks](../m/mid-cap_stocks.md). This can help investors achieve better [diversification](../d/diversification.md) in their portfolios and reduce the [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with overexposure to [large-cap stocks](../l/large_cap_stocks.md).

### Reduced Concentration Risk

[Market](../m/market.md)-cap [weighted](../w/weighted.md) indexes tend to be heavily concentrated in a few large companies. If these companies perform poorly, the entire [index](../i/index_instrument.md) can suffer. In contrast, unweighted indexes spread the [risk](../r/risk.md) more evenly across all component [stocks](../s/stock.md), reducing the impact of poor performance by any single company.

### Better Performance in Small and Mid-Cap Stocks

Historical data suggests that small and [mid-cap stocks](../m/mid-cap_stocks.md) often [outperform](../o/outperform.md) [large-cap stocks](../l/large_cap_stocks.md) over the long term. By giving [equal weight](../e/equal_weight.md) to all component [stocks](../s/stock.md), unweighted indexes can potentially capture more of the growth potential of smaller companies, leading to better overall performance.

## Drawbacks of Unweighted Indexes

### Higher Turnover and Transaction Costs

Maintaining an unweighted [index](../i/index_instrument.md) requires regular [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) to ensure that all component [stocks](../s/stock.md) have [equal weight](../e/equal_weight.md). This can lead to higher [turnover](../t/turnover.md) and increased [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md), which can reduce net returns for investors.

### Underperformance in Bear Markets

In bear markets, [large-cap stocks](../l/large_cap_stocks.md) often perform better than small and [mid-cap stocks](../m/mid-cap_stocks.md) due to their financial stability and resources. As a result, unweighted indexes may [underperform](../u/underperform.md) compared to [market](../m/market.md)-cap [weighted](../w/weighted.md) indexes during [market](../m/market.md) downturns.

### Limited Representation of Market Capitalization

Unweighted indexes do not accurately represent the [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) of the overall [market](../m/market.md). Because they give [equal weight](../e/equal_weight.md) to all component [stocks](../s/stock.md), they may not reflect the true economic impact of larger companies.

## Calculating an Unweighted Index

Calculating an unweighted [index](../i/index_instrument.md) involves assigning equal weights to all component [stocks](../s/stock.md) and then averaging their price changes. The calculation process can be summarized as follows:

1. **Selecting Component [Stocks](../s/stock.md)**: Identify the [stocks](../s/stock.md) to be included in the [index](../i/index_instrument.md).
2. **Assigning Equal Weights**: Assign each stock an [equal weight](../e/equal_weight.md) regardless of its [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md).
3. **Calculating Price Changes**: Determine the price change for each stock over a specific period.
4. **Averaging Price Changes**: Calculate the arithmetic or geometric average of the price changes to determine the [index](../i/index_instrument.md)'s overall performance.

For example, if an unweighted [index](../i/index_instrument.md) includes three [stocks](../s/stock.md) with price changes of +2%, -1%, and +3%, the [index](../i/index_instrument.md)'s performance can be calculated as follows:

- Arithmetic Average: (2% + (-1%) + 3%) / 3 = 1.33%
- Geometric Average: (1.02 * 0.99 * 1.03)^(1/3) - 1 â‰ˆ 1.33%

Both methods [yield](../y/yield.md) a similar result, indicating that the unweighted [index](../i/index_instrument.md) has increased by approximately 1.33% over the specified period.

## Applications in Investment Strategies

### Equal-Weighted Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)

Equal-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) ETFs are investment funds that track unweighted indexes and aim to provide investors with diversified exposure to the [market](../m/market.md). These ETFs regularly rebalance their portfolios to maintain equal weights for all component [stocks](../s/stock.md), which can lead to different performance characteristics compared to [market](../m/market.md)-cap [weighted](../w/weighted.md) ETFs.

### Factor Investing

Unweighted indexes can be used in [factor investing](../f/factor_investing.md), which involves selecting [stocks](../s/stock.md) based on specific characteristics or factors (e.g., [value](../v/value.md), [momentum](../m/momentum.md), quality). By incorporating unweighted indexes into [factor](../f/factor.md)-based strategies, investors can achieve a more balanced exposure to targeted factors and potentially enhance their [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted returns.

### Performance Benchmarking

Unweighted indexes can serve as alternative benchmarks for evaluating investment performance. By comparing the performance of a portfolio to an unweighted [index](../i/index_instrument.md), investors can [gain](../g/gain.md) insights into how well their [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) is capturing the broader [market](../m/market.md)'s performance, especially in terms of small and [mid-cap stocks](../m/mid-cap_stocks.md).

## Conclusion

Unweighted indexes [offer](../o/offer.md) a unique perspective on [stock market](../s/stock_market.md) performance by treating all component [stocks](../s/stock.md) equally. While they provide benefits such as [diversification](../d/diversification.md), reduced concentration [risk](../r/risk.md), and potential outperformance in small and [mid-cap stocks](../m/mid-cap_stocks.md), they also come with drawbacks like higher [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md) and potential underperformance in bear markets.

For investors seeking diversified exposure and an alternative view of the [market](../m/market.md), unweighted indexes and equal-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) ETFs can be valuable tools. However, it's important to consider the associated costs and risks before incorporating them into an [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md). By understanding the characteristics and applications of unweighted indexes, investors can make more informed decisions and better align their portfolios with their financial goals.

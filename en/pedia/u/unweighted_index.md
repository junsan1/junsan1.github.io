# Unweighted Index

An unweighted index, also known as an equal-weighted index, is a type of stock market index where each component stock is given equal importance regardless of its market capitalization. Unlike a market-capitalization-weighted index, where larger companies have a more significant impact on the index's performance, an unweighted index treats each stock equally. This provides a different perspective on the market's performance and can influence investment strategies and portfolio management.

## Understanding Unweighted Indexes

In a traditional market-capitalization-weighted index, the price movements of large-cap stocks dominate the index's performance. For instance, in the S&P 500, companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon carry much more weight than smaller companies. This means that the performance of the index is highly dependent on the performance of these large companies.

In contrast, an unweighted index assigns the same weight to every component stock. This means that a 1% change in the stock price of a small company has the same impact on the index as a 1% change in the stock price of a large company. This can provide a more balanced view of the market's overall performance and can be particularly useful for investors looking to diversify their portfolios.

## Examples of Unweighted Indexes

### Value Line Geometric Index

One of the most well-known unweighted indexes is the Value Line Geometric Index. This index includes around 1,700 stocks from various industries and is calculated using a geometric average. Unlike arithmetic averages, which simply sum the values and divide by the number of observations, geometric averages multiply the values and take the nth root (where n is the number of observations). This type of averaging can provide a more accurate reflection of compound returns over time.

### S&P Equal Weight Index

The S&P Equal Weight Index is another example. It includes the same stocks as the S&P 500 but assigns each stock an equal weight. This ensures that the performance of smaller companies significantly influences the index's overall performance, providing a different perspective compared to the traditional S&P 500.

### Museum of American Finance's NYSE Arca Equal Weighted Index

This index covers a variety of sectors and ensures equal weight across its component stocks. It offers a diversified view of the market and reduces the risk of overexposure to any single stock or sector.

## Benefits of Unweighted Indexes

### Diversification

One of the primary benefits of unweighted indexes is diversification. By giving equal weight to all component stocks, these indexes reduce the influence of large-cap stocks and provide more balanced exposure to small and mid-cap stocks. This can help investors achieve better diversification in their portfolios and reduce the risk associated with overexposure to large-cap stocks.

### Reduced Concentration Risk

Market-cap weighted indexes tend to be heavily concentrated in a few large companies. If these companies perform poorly, the entire index can suffer. In contrast, unweighted indexes spread the risk more evenly across all component stocks, reducing the impact of poor performance by any single company.

### Better Performance in Small and Mid-Cap Stocks

Historical data suggests that small and mid-cap stocks often outperform large-cap stocks over the long term. By giving equal weight to all component stocks, unweighted indexes can potentially capture more of the growth potential of smaller companies, leading to better overall performance.

## Drawbacks of Unweighted Indexes

### Higher Turnover and Transaction Costs

Maintaining an unweighted index requires regular rebalancing to ensure that all component stocks have equal weight. This can lead to higher turnover and increased transaction costs, which can reduce net returns for investors.

### Underperformance in Bear Markets

In bear markets, large-cap stocks often perform better than small and mid-cap stocks due to their financial stability and resources. As a result, unweighted indexes may underperform compared to market-cap weighted indexes during market downturns.

### Limited Representation of Market Capitalization

Unweighted indexes do not accurately represent the market capitalization of the overall market. Because they give equal weight to all component stocks, they may not reflect the true economic impact of larger companies.

## Calculating an Unweighted Index

Calculating an unweighted index involves assigning equal weights to all component stocks and then averaging their price changes. The calculation process can be summarized as follows:

1. **Selecting Component Stocks**: Identify the stocks to be included in the index.
2. **Assigning Equal Weights**: Assign each stock an equal weight regardless of its market capitalization.
3. **Calculating Price Changes**: Determine the price change for each stock over a specific period.
4. **Averaging Price Changes**: Calculate the arithmetic or geometric average of the price changes to determine the index's overall performance.

For example, if an unweighted index includes three stocks with price changes of +2%, -1%, and +3%, the index's performance can be calculated as follows:

- Arithmetic Average: (2% + (-1%) + 3%) / 3 = 1.33%
- Geometric Average: (1.02 * 0.99 * 1.03)^(1/3) - 1 â‰ˆ 1.33%

Both methods yield a similar result, indicating that the unweighted index has increased by approximately 1.33% over the specified period.

## Applications in Investment Strategies

### Equal-Weighted Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)

Equal-weighted ETFs are investment funds that track unweighted indexes and aim to provide investors with diversified exposure to the market. These ETFs regularly rebalance their portfolios to maintain equal weights for all component stocks, which can lead to different performance characteristics compared to market-cap weighted ETFs.

### Factor Investing

Unweighted indexes can be used in factor investing, which involves selecting stocks based on specific characteristics or factors (e.g., value, momentum, quality). By incorporating unweighted indexes into factor-based strategies, investors can achieve a more balanced exposure to targeted factors and potentially enhance their risk-adjusted returns.

### Performance Benchmarking

Unweighted indexes can serve as alternative benchmarks for evaluating investment performance. By comparing the performance of a portfolio to an unweighted index, investors can gain insights into how well their investment strategy is capturing the broader market's performance, especially in terms of small and mid-cap stocks.

## Conclusion

Unweighted indexes offer a unique perspective on stock market performance by treating all component stocks equally. While they provide benefits such as diversification, reduced concentration risk, and potential outperformance in small and mid-cap stocks, they also come with drawbacks like higher transaction costs and potential underperformance in bear markets.

For investors seeking diversified exposure and an alternative view of the market, unweighted indexes and equal-weighted ETFs can be valuable tools. However, it's important to consider the associated costs and risks before incorporating them into an investment strategy. By understanding the characteristics and applications of unweighted indexes, investors can make more informed decisions and better align their portfolios with their financial goals.

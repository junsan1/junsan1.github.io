# Unitized Fund

A unitized [fund](../f/fund.md), also known as an [investment fund](../i/investment_fund.md) or simply a unit [fund](../f/fund.md), is a collective investment scheme which pools [money](../m/money.md) from [multiple](../m/multiple.md) investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of assets. Unlike traditional mutual funds, unitized funds are split into units, each representing a fraction of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) pool's total [value](../v/value.md). Investors purchase these units, and their returns are based on the performance of the combined portfolio.

## How Unitized Funds Work

Unitized funds work by pooling resources from [multiple](../m/multiple.md) investors and [investing](../i/investing.md) them in a diversified portfolio of assets, which may include [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), and other financial instruments. The pooled assets are divided into units, which each [investor](../i/investor.md) owns in proportion to their investment.

1. **Pooling Resources**: Investors contribute [money](../m/money.md) to the [fund](../f/fund.md), which pools these resources together.
2. **Buying Assets**: The pooled [money](../m/money.md) is used by professional [fund](../f/fund.md) managers to purchase a diversified [range](../r/range.md) of assets.
3. **Unit Creation**: The total pool of assets is divided into units. The number of units an [investor](../i/investor.md) owns is proportional to their investment.
4. **[Valuation](../v/valuation.md)**: The [value](../v/value.md) of the units fluctuates based on the performance of the [fund](../f/fund.md)’s investments.
5. **Buy/Sell Units**: Investors can buy new units or sell existing ones at the unit’s current [value](../v/value.md).

The unitized structure allows for greater flexibility and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), as investors can typically buy or sell units on any [business](../b/business.md) day at the prevailing unit price. This contrasts with some other forms of collective investments that may have limited [redemption](../r/redemption.md) opportunities.

## Key Features of Unitized Funds

- **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: By pooling resources, unitized funds can invest in a broad [range](../r/range.md) of assets, spreading [risk](../r/risk.md) across various investments.
- **Professional Management**: Funds are managed by professional portfolio managers who make investment decisions, aiming to achieve the best returns for the investors.
- **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)**: Investors can often buy and sell units on a regular [basis](../b/basis.md), providing flexibility and ease of access to their investments.
- **Accessibility**: Unitized funds allow individual investors to access a diversified portfolio of assets that they might not be able to afford on their own.
- **[Transparency](../t/transparency.md)**: Regular reporting and unit pricing provide [transparency](../t/transparency.md) on the [value](../v/value.md) and performance of the investment.

## Types of Unitized Funds

Unitized funds come in various forms, depending on the types of assets they invest in and their investment objectives. Common types include:

1. **[Equity](../e/equity.md) Funds**: Invest in [stocks](../s/stock.md) and aim for long-term [capital](../c/capital.md) growth. They may focus on specific sectors, regions, or company sizes.
2. **[Bond](../b/bond.md) Funds**: Invest in fixed-[income](../i/income.md) securities such as government and corporate bonds, seeking stable [income](../i/income.md) and [preservation of capital](../p/preservation_of_capital.md).
3. **Balanced Funds**: Invest in a mix of equities and bonds, aiming to balance [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md).
4. **[Money Market](../m/money_market.md) Funds**: Invest in short-term, high-quality [debt](../d/debt.md) instruments, aiming for [capital preservation](../c/capital_preservation.md) and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).
5. **[Real Estate](../r/real_estate.md) Funds**: Invest in [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) properties or [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) investment trusts (REITs), providing exposure to the [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) [market](../m/market.md).
6. **[Index](../i/index_instrument.md) Funds**: Track a specific [index](../i/index_instrument.md), such as the S&P 500, aiming to replicate the performance of the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md).
7. **Sector Funds**: Focus on specific sectors like technology, healthcare, or energy, allowing investors to target specific industries.
8. **Global or International Funds**: Invest in assets globally, providing exposure to international markets.

## Advantages of Unitized Funds

Investors in unitized funds benefit from several advantages, making them a popular choice for both individual and institutional investors:

- **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: By [investing](../i/investing.md) in a wide [range](../r/range.md) of assets, unitized funds reduce exposure to the risks associated with any single investment.
- **[Economies of Scale](../e/economies_of_scale.md)**: Pooling resources allows funds to take advantage of lower [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md) and access to a wider [range](../r/range.md) of investments.
- **Professional Expertise**: [Fund](../f/fund.md) managers apply their knowledge and expertise to manage the portfolio, making informed investment decisions on behalf of investors.
- **Flexibility**: Investors can adjust their [holdings](../h/holdings.md) by buying or selling units, making it easy to respond to [market](../m/market.md) changes or personal financial needs.
- **Reduced [Barriers to Entry](../b/barriers_to_entry.md)**: Unitized funds provide access to a diversified portfolio with relatively small initial investments, making them accessible to a broader [range](../r/range.md) of investors.

## Disadvantages of Unitized Funds

While unitized funds [offer](../o/offer.md) numerous benefits, they also come with certain drawbacks:

- **Management Fees**: Professional management comes at a cost, with fees that can eat into returns. These may include management fees, performance fees, and other expenses.
- **Potential for Underperformance**: Even professional managers can make poor investment decisions, and there is no guarantee of achieving high returns.
- **[Liquidity Risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md)**: Although generally [liquid](../l/liquid.md), some unitized funds may face [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) challenges, particularly in times of [market](../m/market.md) stress.
- **[Market Risk](../m/market_risk.md)**: Like all investments, unitized funds are subject to [market risk](../m/market_risk.md), and their [value](../v/value.md) can fluctuate based on [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

## Differences Between Unitized Funds and Mutual Funds

While unitized funds and mutual funds share similarities, such as pooling investors' funds and professional management, they have distinct differences:

- **Structure**: Unitized funds are divided into units, whereas mutual funds are typically divided into [shares](../s/shares.md).
- **Pricing**: Unitized [fund](../f/fund.md) units are usually priced daily based on the net [asset](../a/asset.md) [value](../v/value.md) (NAV) of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets. Mutual funds also use NAV but may have additional pricing mechanisms like forward pricing.
- **Regulation**: The regulatory framework governing unitized funds and mutual funds can differ depending on the jurisdiction.
- **Investment Strategies**: While both can follow a variety of strategies, unitized funds may [offer](../o/offer.md) more flexibility in terms of [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) and investment [options](../o/options.md).

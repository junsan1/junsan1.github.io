One of the defining features of Uphold is its support for a diverse range of assets. Users can trade between cryptocurrencies, traditional fiat currencies, precious metals, and U.S. equities on a single platform. This versatility allows for unique trading strategies and portfolio diversification.

### Cryptocurrencies

Uphold supports over 30 cryptocurrencies, including popular options like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and lesser-known altcoins. This extensive selection caters to both novice and experienced crypto traders.

### Fiat Currencies

The platform supports multiple fiat currencies, allowing users to hold and transact in traditional money alongside digital assets. Supported currencies include USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, and others, facilitating international transactions and reducing the need for exchanges.

### U.S. Equities

Recently, Uphold introduced the ability to trade U.S. equities, making it easier for users to invest in the stock market without leaving the platform. This integration opens up new avenues for portfolio diversification and aligns with the growing trend of fractional share trading.

## Cross-Asset Trading

Uphold's "Anything-to-Anything" trading capability is a standout feature, allowing users to trade directly between different asset classes without needing to convert to fiat first.

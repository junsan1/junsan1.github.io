# History and Background

Founded in 2014 by Halsey Minor, an [entrepreneur](../e/entrepreneur.md) who played a significant role in the early days of the internet, Uphold was initially known as Bitreserve.

# Key Features

## Asset Versatility

One of the defining features of Uphold is its support for a diverse [range](../r/range.md) of assets. Users can [trade](../t/trade.md) between cryptocurrencies, traditional fiat currencies, precious metals, and U.S. equities on a single platform. This versatility allows for unique [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) and [portfolio diversification](../p/portfolio_diversification.md).

### Cryptocurrencies

Uphold supports over 30 cryptocurrencies, including popular [options](../o/options.md) like [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) (BTC), [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) (ETH), and lesser-known altcoins. This extensive selection caters to both novice and experienced crypto traders.

### Fiat Currencies

The platform supports [multiple](../m/multiple.md) fiat currencies, allowing users to [hold](../h/hold.md) and transact in traditional [money](../m/money.md) alongside digital assets. Supported currencies include USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, and others, facilitating international transactions and reducing the need for exchanges.

### Precious Metals

Uphold offers trading in precious metals such as gold, silver, [platinum](../p/platinum.md), and palladium. This feature appeals to investors seeking safe-haven assets or those looking to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

### U.S. Equities

Recently, Uphold introduced the ability to [trade](../t/trade.md) U.S. equities, making it easier for users to invest in the [stock market](../s/stock_market.md) without leaving the platform. This integration opens up new avenues for [portfolio diversification](../p/portfolio_diversification.md) and aligns with the growing [trend](../t/trend.md) of [fractional share](../f/fractional_share.md) trading.

## Cross-Asset Trading

Uphold's "Anything-to-Anything" trading capability is a standout feature, allowing users to [trade](../t/trade.md) directly between different [asset](../a/asset.md) classes without needing to convert to fiat first. For example, users can [exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) for gold or convert Euros directly into [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md). This seamless cross-[asset](../a/asset.md) trading provides greater flexibility and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) compared to traditional exchanges.

# Uphold Earn and Credit Lines

## Uphold Earn

## Credit Lines

In addition to trading and earning, Uphold provides [credit](../c/credit.md) lines backed by digital assets.

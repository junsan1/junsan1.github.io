# Underlying Retention

## Introduction

In the realm of [finance](../f/finance.md) and [insurance](../i/insurance.md), the term "[underlying](../u/underlying.md) retention" holds a crucial position. [Underlying](../u/underlying.md) retention refers to the amount of [risk](../r/risk.md) an [insurance](../i/insurance.md) company retains on a primary [basis](../b/basis.md) before transferring the excess [risk](../r/risk.md) to a reinsurer. This concept is pivotal because it shapes how [risk](../r/risk.md) is distributed between the insurer and the reinsurer, impacting the overall stability and profitability of both entities.

## Components of Underlying Retention

### Primary Insurance
Primary [insurance](../i/insurance.md) involves the direct coverage provided by an [insurance](../i/insurance.md) company to the policyholder. In this context, [underlying](../u/underlying.md) retention represents the portion of [risk](../r/risk.md) that the primary insurer decides to keep on its books. This decision is influenced by several factors, including the company's [risk](../r/risk.md) appetite, [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) strategy, and [capital](../c/capital.md) reserves.

### Reinsurance
[Reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) is a process whereby an [insurance](../i/insurance.md) company cedes a portion of its [risk](../r/risk.md) to another [insurance](../i/insurance.md) company, known as the reinsurer. The [underlying](../u/underlying.md) retention level determines the threshold beyond which the reinsurer becomes responsible for covering claims. This arrangement helps primary insurers manage their [risk](../r/risk.md) exposure and stabilize their [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md).

### Retention Limits
Retention limits are the predefined amounts of [risk](../r/risk.md) that an insurer chooses to retain. Setting these limits involves a careful assessment of potential losses, historical data, and actuarial models. The goal is to balance [risk](../r/risk.md) retention with the need for [risk](../r/risk.md) transfer to ensure the insurer's [solvency](../s/solvency.md) and profitability.

## Importance of Underlying Retention

### Risk Management
Effective [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) is fundamental to the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) [industry](../i/industry.md). By retaining a certain amount of [risk](../r/risk.md), insurers can better align their interests with those of policyholders. This alignment fosters prudent [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) practices and encourages insurers to carefully assess and price risks.

### Capital Efficiency
Retention decisions impact an insurer's [capital](../c/capital.md) [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md). Retaining too much [risk](../r/risk.md) can strain [capital](../c/capital.md) reserves, potentially compromising the insurer's ability to pay claims. Conversely, excessive reliance on [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) can erode [profit margins](../p/profit_margins_in_trading.md). Striking the right balance is essential for optimizing [capital](../c/capital.md) utilization.

### Profitability
The profitability of an [insurance](../i/insurance.md) company is influenced by its retention strategy. Retained premiums contribute directly to an insurer's [revenue](../r/revenue.md), while [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) premiums represent a cost. Effective retention management ensures that insurers retain profitable risks and share less desirable risks with reinsurers.

## Factors Influencing Underlying Retention

### Company Size and Capitalization
Larger insurers with substantial [capital](../c/capital.md) reserves may opt to retain higher levels of [risk](../r/risk.md). Smaller insurers, on the other hand, might cede more [risk](../r/risk.md) to reinsurers to protect their financial stability.

### Type of Insurance
The nature of the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) product also affects retention decisions. For example, [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policies typically involve long-term commitments, making it crucial for insurers to carefully manage [underlying](../u/underlying.md) retention. Property and casualty [insurance](../i/insurance.md), with its shorter-term contracts, may have different retention dynamics.

### Market Conditions
Prevailing [market](../m/market.md) conditions, including [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, economic trends, and regulatory changes, can influence retention strategies. During periods of economic [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md), insurers may choose to retain less [risk](../r/risk.md) to safeguard their financial position.

### Historical Loss Experience
Past loss experience provides valuable insights into the optimal retention levels. Insurers analyze historical claims data to identify patterns and trends, allowing them to make informed retention decisions.

## Underlying Retention in Practice

### Example: Catastrophe Reinsurance
In catastrophe [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md), insurers face the [risk](../r/risk.md) of large-scale events such as hurricanes, earthquakes, or floods. To manage this [risk](../r/risk.md), insurers often set relatively low retention limits and transfer a significant portion of the [risk](../r/risk.md) to reinsurers. By doing so, they protect themselves from catastrophic losses that could threaten their [solvency](../s/solvency.md).

### Example: Health Insurance
[Health insurance](../h/health_insurance.md) companies employ [underlying](../u/underlying.md) retention strategies to manage the risks associated with healthcare claims. They may retain a portion of routine medical expenses while ceding the [risk](../r/risk.md) of high-cost treatments and chronic conditions to reinsurers.

## Benefits and Challenges

### Benefits
1. **Financial Stability**: Retention strategies promote financial stability by distributing [risk](../r/risk.md) effectively.
2. **Profitability**: Properly managed retention levels can enhance profitability by retaining profitable risks.
3. **[Customer](../c/customer.md) [Trust](../t/trust.md)**: Insurers that manage retention well can build [trust](../t/trust.md) with policyholders, ensuring timely claims payments.

### Challenges
1. **Accurate [Risk](../r/risk.md) Assessment**: Determining optimal retention levels requires precise [risk](../r/risk.md) assessment and actuarial expertise.
2. **[Market](../m/market.md) [Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: Economic and [market](../m/market.md) fluctuations can impact the effectiveness of retention strategies.
3. **[Reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) Costs**: High [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) premiums can affect the cost-benefit ratio of retention decisions.

## Conclusion

The concept of [underlying](../u/underlying.md) retention is pivotal in the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) [industry](../i/industry.md). It represents the balance between retaining [risk](../r/risk.md) and transferring it to reinsurers. By carefully managing retention levels, insurers can achieve financial stability, enhance profitability, and build [trust](../t/trust.md) with policyholders. While there are challenges associated with retention decisions, the benefits underscore the importance of this practice in maintaining a [robust](../r/robust.md) and resilient [insurance](../i/insurance.md) ecosystem.

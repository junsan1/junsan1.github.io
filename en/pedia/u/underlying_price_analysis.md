# Underlying Price Analysis

One of the core concepts in trading, especially in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) (also known as `algo-trading` or `automated trading`), is the analysis of the underlying price of an asset. The underlying price refers to the current market price of a financial instrument or asset, such as stocks, commodities, currencies, or [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md). This analysis is critical for making informed trading decisions, constructing [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md), and managing risk effectively.

## Definitions and Basics

### Underlying Asset
The `underlying asset` is the financial asset upon which a derivative's price is based. For instance, in options trading, the stock (e.g., Apple Inc. stock) is the underlying asset for an option on that stock. The underlying price of this asset is pivotal in determining the pricing and movement of the derivative itself.

### Importance of Underlying Price
1. **Pricing [Derivatives](../d/derivatives.md)**: The underlying price is the primary component in the pricing models of [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), such as options, futures, and swaps.
2. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Accurate underlying price analysis helps determine exposure and manage risks effectively.
3. **[Trading Strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md)**: Algorithms are often based on the analysis of underlying prices to determine entry and exit points.
4. **[Market Sentiment Analysis](../m/market_sentiment_analysis.md)**: Changes in the underlying price can reflect investor sentiment, market trends, and economic factors.

## Methods of Underlying Price Analysis

### Fundamental Analysis
[Fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md) involves evaluating the intrinsic value of an asset by examining related economic, financial, and other qualitative and quantitative factors. 

1. **Financial Statements**: Analysis of a company's earnings reports, balance sheets, income statements, cash flow statements.
2. **[Economic Indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md)**: GDP growth, inflation rates, employment data.
3. **[Industry Analysis](../i/industry_analysis.md)**: Comparing the company with its peers in the same sector.
4. **Company Analysis**: Management effectiveness, business model, competitive advantage.

### Technical Analysis
[Technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) focuses on statistical analysis of market activity, such as price movement and volume.

1. **Price Charts**: Line charts, bar charts, and candlestick charts to visualize price movements.
2. **Indicators and Oscillators**: Moving averages, Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD).
3. **Patterns**: Head and shoulders, double tops and bottoms, triangles, flags.
4. **[Volume Analysis](../v/volume_analysis.md)**: Observing the trading volume to confirm trends and price moves.

### Quantitative Analysis
[Quantitative analysis](../q/quantitative_analysis.md) involves using mathematical and statistical models to analyze price data and predict future movements.

1. **Algorithmic Models**: Using algorithms to identify profitable trading opportunities.
2. **Statistical Approaches**: [Regression analysis](../r/regression_analysis.md), time-series analysis.
3. **Machine Learning**: Using AI and machine learning models to predict price movements.

### Sentiment Analysis
[Sentiment analysis](../s/sentiment_analysis.md) gauges the mood or attitude of the market participants.

1. **News Analysis**: Monitoring news, social media, and reports to gauge market sentiment.
2. **[Sentiment Indicators](../s/sentiment_indicators.md)**: [Fear and Greed Index](../f/fear_and_greed_index.md), [sentiment surveys](../s/sentiment_surveys.md), and indices.

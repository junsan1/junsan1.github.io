# Upside/Downside Gap Three Methods

**The [Upside](../u/upside.md)/Downside Gap Three Methods** is a [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) pattern used in stock trading and [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) to identify potential continuation signals in price movements. This pattern is part of the [candlestick charting techniques](../c/candlestick_charting_techniques.md) which are heavily employed by traders to make informed decisions. The pattern itself can be bifurcated into two categories: the [Upside](../u/upside.md) Gap Three Methods and the Downside Gap Three Methods. Each indicates whether the prevailing [trend](../t/trend.md) is likely to continue in its respective upward or downward direction.

## Upside Gap Three Methods

### Definition and Components

The **[Upside](../u/upside.md) Gap Three Methods** is a bullish continuation pattern. It signifies that the upward [trend](../t/trend.md) [will](../w/will.md) likely continue. The pattern is composed of five candlesticks: the first two are an [upside](../u/upside.md) gap, the third is typically a small body [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) that fills the gap formed, and the last two continue the movement in the direction of the [trend](../t/trend.md).

1. **First [Candlestick](../c/candlestick.md)**: This is a large bullish (white or green) [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) in an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md).
2. **Second [Candlestick](../c/candlestick.md)**: Another bullish [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) that [gaps](../g/gap.md) up on the [open](../o/open.md), maintaining the gap created by the first [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md).
3. **Third [Candlestick](../c/candlestick.md)**: A bearish (red or black) [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) that opens lower than the second [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) and closes higher than the first [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md)’s body. This often brings the prices into the gap between the first two candlesticks but does not close the gap completely.
4. **Fourth [Candlestick](../c/candlestick.md)**: A bullish [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) that opens at or higher than the third [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md)’s close and reaffirms the continuation of the [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md).
5. **Fifth [Candlestick](../c/candlestick.md)**: Another bullish [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) that follows through on the upward movement, confirming the pattern.

### Interpretation

The [Upside](../u/upside.md) Gap Three Methods pattern indicates strong bullish sentiment. The initial gap up shows a strong buyer [interest](../i/interest.md), but the small [retracement](../r/retracement.md) (third [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md)) indicates some [profit](../p/profit.md)-taking or [pullback](../p/pullback.md). However, as soon as the bearish pressure subsides, the upward [momentum](../m/momentum.md) resumes, confirming the original bullish [trend](../t/trend.md).

### Trading Strategy

Traders typically look for confirmation before entering a position. They may consider the following strategies:

1. **Entry Point**: Enter a long position after the formation of the fifth [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md).
2. **Stop Loss**: Place a stop loss below the low of the third [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) to manage [risk](../r/risk.md).
3. **Target Price**: Set a target price based on previous resistance levels or use [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicator.md) like the [Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (RSI) to identify [overbought](../o/overbought.md) conditions.

### Example

Imagine the stock of a tech company is in an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md), and over five days, the candlesticks form an [Upside](../u/upside.md) Gap Three Methods pattern. A [trader](../t/trader.md) recognizing this pattern might decide to go long on the stock, placing a stop loss just below the third day's low and setting a [price target](../p/price_target.md) based on recent highs.

## Downside Gap Three Methods

### Definition and Components

The **Downside Gap Three Methods** is a bearish continuation pattern and signals that the [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md) is likely to persist. The pattern similarly involves five candlesticks but indicates bearish sentiment.

1. **First [Candlestick](../c/candlestick.md)**: A large bearish (red or black) [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) in a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md).
2. **Second [Candlestick](../c/candlestick.md)**: Another bearish [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) that [gaps](../g/gap.md) down on the [open](../o/open.md), continuing the [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md).
3. **Third [Candlestick](../c/candlestick.md)**: A bullish (white or green) [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) that opens higher than the second [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) but closes lower than the first [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md)’s body, usually filling the gap partially.
4. **Fourth [Candlestick](../c/candlestick.md)**: A bearish [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) that opens below or at the third [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md)’s close, resuming the downward [momentum](../m/momentum.md).
5. **Fifth [Candlestick](../c/candlestick.md)**: Another bearish [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) that follows through on the downward movement, confirming the pattern.

### Interpretation

The Downside Gap Three Methods pattern showcases strong bearish sentiment. The initial gap down indicates significant selling pressure. The small [rally](../r/rally.md) (third [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md)) represents some buying [interest](../i/interest.md) or [short covering](../s/short_covering.md) but is insufficient to close the gap completely. The subsequent continuation of the [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md) indicates that the bearish sentiment remains intact.

### Trading Strategy

Similar to the [Upside](../u/upside.md) Gap Three Methods, traders look for confirmation before taking positions:

1. **Entry Point**: Enter a short position after the fifth [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) forms.
2. **Stop Loss**: Place a stop loss above the third [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md)’s high to minimize [risk](../r/risk.md).
3. **Target Price**: Set a target price based on previous [support levels](../s/support_levels.md) or using [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicator.md) like the Moving Average Convergence [Divergence](../d/divergence.md) (MACD) to find [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions.

### Example

Consider a stock in a biotechnology sector experiencing a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md). Over five days, the candlesticks form a Downside Gap Three Methods pattern. A [trader](../t/trader.md) could decide to short the stock, place a stop loss above the high of the third [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md), and set a target price at a prior support level.

## Practical Considerations

### Advantages

1. **Reliability**: These patterns are considered reliable continuation signals in [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md).
2. **Simplicity**: The straightforward nature of the patterns makes them easy to identify and interpret.
3. **Timeliness**: The five-[candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) structure provides a timely signal for traders seeking to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on ongoing trends.

### Limitations

1. **[Market](../m/market.md) Context**: The effectiveness of these patterns can be influenced by [market](../m/market.md) conditions; they might not perform well in choppy or sideways markets.
2. **Confirmation Needed**: Traders need to wait for confirmation of the pattern to avoid [false signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md), potentially leading to missed opportunities.
3. **Complementary Analysis**: Relying solely on these patterns without considering other [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicator.md) or [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md) could be risky.

### Algorithmic Trading Implications

In [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), the [Upside](../u/upside.md) and Downside Gap Three Methods patterns can be coded into [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md). By using historical data and predefined criteria, algorithms can automatically identify these patterns and execute trades without human intervention.

### Example Algorithmic Code (Python)

Here's a simple example using Python and a library like `pandas` for data manipulation:

```python
[import](../i/import.md) pandas as pd

def is_upside_gap_three_methods(data):
    if (data['Close'][0] < data['[Open](../o/open.md)'][0] and
        data['Close'][1] > data['[Open](../o/open.md)'][1] and
        data['[Open](../o/open.md)'][1] > data['Close'][0] and
        data['Close'][2] < data['[Open](../o/open.md)'][2] and
        data['[Open](../o/open.md)'][2] < data['Close'][1] and
        data['Close'][2] > data['Close'][0] and
        data['Close'][3] > data['Close'][1] and
        data['Close'][4] > data['Close'][3]):
        [return](../r/return.md) True
    [return](../r/return.md) False

# Assuming df is a pandas DataFrame with columns ['Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close']
# and five rows corresponding to candlesticks
if is_upside_gap_three_methods(df):
    print("[Upside](../u/upside.md) Gap Three Methods pattern found.")
```

Algo traders could incorporate this function within their trading system to automatically detect and act upon the pattern.

# United States Treasury Money Mutual Funds

United States Treasury [Money](../m/money.md) Mutual Funds, often abbreviated as [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) MMFs, are a type of [money market fund](../m/money_market_fund.md) that invests exclusively in short-term government securities. These funds are designed to provide investors with high [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), low [risk](../r/risk.md), and moderate yields. They are commonly used by individual investors, institutional investors, corporations, and other entities as a means of preserving [capital](../c/capital.md) while earning a [return](../r/return.md) that typically exceeds that of a traditional [savings account](../s/savings_account.md). 

## Definition and Characteristics

[U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) [Money](../m/money.md) Mutual Funds invest primarily in [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) bills, notes, and other government securities that are backed by the full faith and [credit](../c/credit.md) of the [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md). These [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets are considered among the safest investments available, due to the low [default risk](../d/default_risk.md) associated with the U.S. government. Consequently, [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) MMFs are sought after for their stability and reliability.

### Key Characteristics:
1. **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)**: [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) MMFs [offer](../o/offer.md) high [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), enabling investors to access their funds quickly.
2. **Safety**: Since they invest only in government-backed securities, these funds are considered extremely safe.
3. **[Yield](../y/yield.md)**: While not as high as riskier investments, the [yield](../y/yield.md) on [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) MMFs is typically higher than that of traditional savings accounts or certificates of [deposit](../d/deposit.md) (CDs).
4. **Short-Term [Maturity](../m/maturity.md)**: The securities in these funds usually have maturities of less than one year, with a focus on short-term instruments like Treasury bills.

## Types of Securities Held

The primary securities held within [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) MMFs include:

### U.S. Treasury Bills (T-Bills)
These are short-term securities that mature in one year or less. They are sold at a [discount](../d/discount.md) from their [face value](../f/face_value.md) and do not pay periodic [interest](../i/interest.md). Upon [maturity](../m/maturity.md), the U.S. government pays the holder the full [face value](../f/face_value.md) of the bill.

### U.S. Treasury Notes
These are medium-term securities with maturities ranging from two to ten years. They pay [interest](../i/interest.md) every six months and [return](../r/return.md) the [principal](../p/principal.md) upon [maturity](../m/maturity.md).

### Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)
Although less common in MMFs due to their longer maturities, some funds may [hold](../h/hold.md) TIPS. These are designed to protect against [inflation](../i/inflation.md) and derive their [principal](../p/principal.md) [value](../v/value.md) from the Consumer Price [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (CPI).

## How They Work

### Investment Process
Investors buy [shares](../s/shares.md) in the MMF, and the [fund manager](../f/fund_manager.md) then uses this [capital](../c/capital.md) to purchase [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) securities on behalf of the investors. The [earnings](../e/earnings.md) generated from these securities—whether through [interest](../i/interest.md) payments or [capital](../c/capital.md) gains—are distributed among the shareholders, usually on a monthly [basis](../b/basis.md).

### NAV and Share Price
Unlike other mutual funds, [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) MMFs strive to maintain a stable Net [Asset](../a/asset.md) [Value](../v/value.md) (NAV) of $1 per share. This stability is achieved through the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s investment in low-[risk](../r/risk.md), short-term securities. However, the share price can fluctuate slightly due to [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

## Advantages and Risks

### Advantages
1. **[Capital Preservation](../c/capital_preservation.md)**: Low [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) and short-term maturities result in minimal price [volatility](../v/volatility.md).
2. **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)**: Ease of access to funds, suitable for emergency savings or short-term financial goals.
3. **Simplicity**: Lower complexity compared to other types of funds, making them easier to understand for retail investors.

### Risks
1. **Low Returns**: Limited to modest [yield](../y/yield.md) due to the nature of short-term government securities.
2. **[Interest Rate Risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md)**: An increase in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates could decrease the [value](../v/value.md) of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) securities.
3. **[Inflation](../i/inflation.md) [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: The [return](../r/return.md) may not always keep pace with [inflation](../i/inflation.md), thereby eroding [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) over time.

## Regulations and Standards

### SEC Regulations
The U.S. Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) regulates [money market](../m/money_market.md) funds under the [Investment Company Act of 1940](../i/investment_company_act_of_1940.md). Key regulations that specifically impact [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) MMFs include:

1. **Rule 2a-7**: This rule imposes restrictions on the [credit](../c/credit.md) quality, [maturity](../m/maturity.md), and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) of the investments held by [money market](../m/money_market.md) funds.
2. **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) Requirements**: Funds must [hold](../h/hold.md) at least 10% of their assets in daily [liquid](../l/liquid.md) assets and 30% in weekly [liquid](../l/liquid.md) assets.
3. **[Stress Testing](../s/stress_testing.md)**: Funds must regularly conduct stress tests to assess their ability to maintain NAV stability under adverse [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

### Ratings and Quality
[U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) MMFs are usually rated by [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) agencies such as Moody's, Standard & Poor's, and [Fitch Ratings](../f/fitch_ratings.md). These ratings assess the [credit](../c/credit.md) quality of the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s [holdings](../h/holdings.md) and provide investors a gauge of the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s [risk](../r/risk.md) level.

## Tax Implications

### Interest Income
The [interest](../i/interest.md) earned from [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) securities held within MMFs is subject to [federal income](../f/federal_income.md) tax but is generally exempt from state and local [taxes](../t/taxes.md). This tax advantage makes them appealing for investors in high-tax states.

### Capital Gains and Losses
Any [capital](../c/capital.md) gains distributed by the [fund](../f/fund.md) are taxable in the year they are realized. Similarly, any losses can be used to [offset](../o/offset.md) other [capital](../c/capital.md) gains but are subject to specific limits and regulations.

## Use Cases

### Individual Investors
Individuals use [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) MMFs for short-term savings, including emergency funds, due to their safety and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).

### Institutional Investors
Corporations and large institutions often park excess cash in [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) MMFs to manage [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) while earning a modest [return](../r/return.md).

### Trusts and Estates
These funds are also popular in the management of trusts and estates to ensure [capital preservation](../c/capital_preservation.md) while meeting short-term [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) needs.

## Conclusion

[U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) [Money](../m/money.md) Mutual Funds [offer](../o/offer.md) a highly [liquid](../l/liquid.md), low-[risk](../r/risk.md) investment option for both individual and institutional investors. By focusing on short-term government-backed securities, they provide a [safe haven](../s/safe_haven.md) for [capital](../c/capital.md), especially in uncertain economic times. However, investors should be aware of the lower yields and potential [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) and [inflation](../i/inflation.md) risks associated with these funds. As always, careful consideration and understanding of one’s financial goals and [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) are crucial when incorporating any investment type into a portfolio.

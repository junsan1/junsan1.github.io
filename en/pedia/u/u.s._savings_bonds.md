# U.S. Savings Bonds

U.S. Savings Bonds are government-issued securities that [offer](../o/offer.md) a way for individuals to lend [money](../m/money.md) to the U.S. government in [exchange](../e/exchange.md) for [interest](../i/interest.md) payments over a specific period of time. They are considered one of the safest investments because they are backed by the full faith and [credit](../c/credit.md) of the United States government. In this detailed guide, we [will](../w/will.md) delve deep into the characteristics, types, benefits, and methods of [investing](../i/investing.md) in U.S. Savings Bonds. 

## What Are U.S. Savings Bonds?

U.S. Savings Bonds are non-[marketable securities](../m/marketable_securities.md), meaning they cannot be sold or transferred in any secondary markets. They are designed to encourage savings by small investors and are available in both electronic and paper form. These bonds are known for their accessibility and affordability, often requiring low initial investment amounts.

## Types of U.S. Savings Bonds

There are primarily two types of U.S. Savings Bonds:

### Series EE Bonds

Series EE Bonds are low-[risk](../r/risk.md) savings products that earn a [fixed interest rate](../f/fixed_interest_rate.md) for up to 30 years. They are sold at [face value](../f/face_value.md), meaning if you buy a $50 [bond](../b/bond.md), you pay $50. [Interest](../i/interest.md) in Series EE Bonds accrues monthly and is compounded semiannually. They guarantee to at least double in [value](../v/value.md) over a 20-year period.

#### Key Features

- **Purchase Limits**: You can buy up to $10,000 worth of Series EE bonds per calendar year.
- **[Interest](../i/interest.md) Rates**: The [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) is fixed and determined at the time of purchase.
- **[Redemption](../r/redemption.md)**: They can be redeemed any time after 12 months but [will](../w/will.md) incur a penalty if redeemed before 5 years.
- **Tax Considerations**: [Interest](../i/interest.md) earned on EE bonds is subject to [federal income](../f/federal_income.md) tax but is exempt from state and local [taxes](../t/taxes.md). There are also education tax exclusions.

### Series I Bonds

Series I Bonds are designed to protect your savings from [inflation](../i/inflation.md). These bonds earn a combination of a [fixed interest rate](../f/fixed_interest_rate.md) and an [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rate that is adjusted semiannually. Like EE Bonds, they are also sold at [face value](../f/face_value.md).

#### Key Features

- **[Inflation](../i/inflation.md) Protection**: The [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rate is linked to the Consumer Price [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U).
- **Purchase Limits**: You can buy up to $10,000 worth of Series I bonds per calendar year.
- **[Redemption](../r/redemption.md)**: They too can be redeemed any time after 12 months, with a penalty if redeemed before 5 years.
- **Tax Considerations**: Similar to EE bonds, [interest](../i/interest.md) is subject to [federal income](../f/federal_income.md) tax but exempt from state and local [taxes](../t/taxes.md). They also qualify for possible education tax exclusions.

## Benefits

### Safety

Since U.S. Savings Bonds are backed by the U.S. government, they [offer](../o/offer.md) one of the highest safety levels available in the realm of investments.

### Affordability

Purchasing U.S. Savings Bonds requires a minimal initial investment, making them accessible to a broad spectrum of investors.

### Tax Advantages

[Interest](../i/interest.md) earned on U.S. Savings Bonds can be [tax-deferred](../t/tax_deferred.md) until the bonds are cashed in or reach [maturity](../m/maturity.md). Moreover, they are exempt from state and local [taxes](../t/taxes.md), and under certain conditions, they can be used [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md) for educational expenses.

### Inflation Protection

Series I Bonds [offer](../o/offer.md) a [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against [inflation](../i/inflation.md), ensuring that the [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) of your investment does not erode over time.

## How to Buy U.S. Savings Bonds

### Electronic Version

## Redeeming U.S. Savings Bonds

## Tax Considerations

### Federal Taxes

[Interest](../i/interest.md) on U.S. Savings Bonds is subject to [federal income](../f/federal_income.md) tax. However, you can choose to defer reporting the [interest](../i/interest.md) until the year you redeem the [bond](../b/bond.md) or the [bond](../b/bond.md) matures, whichever comes first.

### State and Local Taxes 

U.S. Savings Bonds are exempt from state and local [income](../i/income.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md), making them especially attractive for investors in high-tax areas.

### Education Tax Exclusion

If you use the proceeds from your U.S. Savings Bonds for qualified educational expenses, you may be able to exclude the [interest](../i/interest.md) earned from your [federal income](../f/federal_income.md) tax. Several conditions must be met, such as [income](../i/income.md) limitations and the use of funds at eligible educational institutions.

## Example Calculations

### Series EE Bond

Assuming a [Series EE Bond](../s/series_ee_bond.md) is purchased for $100 at a [fixed interest rate](../f/fixed_interest_rate.md) of 0.10%:

- In 1 Year: $100 * (1 + 0.001) = $100.10
- In 10 Years: $100.10 * (1 + 0.001) ** 10 ≈ $101.00
- In 20 Years: The [bond](../b/bond.md) [will](../w/will.md) double in [value](../v/value.md) to $200.

### Series I Bond

Assuming a [Series I Bond](../s/series_i_bond.md) is purchased for $100 with a [fixed interest rate](../f/fixed_interest_rate.md) of 0.20% and an [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rate of 1.00%:

- In 1 Year: $100 * (1 + 0.002 + 0.01) = $101.20
- In 10 Years: $101.20 * (1 + 0.012) ** 10 ≈ $112.68
- In 20 Years: $112.68 * (1 + 0.012) ** 20 ≈ $137.80

U.S. Savings Bonds [offer](../o/offer.md) a secure, low-[risk](../r/risk.md) investment choice for individuals aiming to save conservatively.

# Unsolicited Bid

An unsolicited bid is a proposal made by one company to acquire another, which is not actively seeking a buyer. Unlike a friendly or negotiated acquisition, an unsolicited bid comes as a surprise to the target company's management and board of directors. This type of bid can lead to a hostile takeover, where the acquiring company proceeds with the acquisition despite resistance from the target company’s leadership.

## Key Characteristics

### Surprise Element
One of the most defining aspects of an unsolicited bid is its unexpected nature. The target company's management is usually caught off guard, having had no prior discussions or negotiations with the acquiring entity.

### Strategic Acquisition
Acquiring companies often pursue unsolicited bids when they see significant strategic value in owning the target company. This could be due to operational efficiencies, market expansion, access to proprietary technologies, or other synergistic benefits.

### Public Announcement
In many cases, the acquiring company makes its intentions public to pressure the target company's shareholders and management into considering the offer. This can be done through a press release, publicizing the terms and benefits of the proposed acquisition.

### Decision Pressure
The unsolicited nature of the bid puts immediate pressure on the target company’s board of directors to evaluate the offer, often under a tight deadline. The board must weigh the unsolicited bid against the company's standalone strategic plan and any potential alternative offers.

## Process and Stages

### Initial Offer
Often referred to as the "bear hug," the initial offer is typically communicated directly to the target company’s board of directors in a formal letter outlining the terms and benefits of the proposed acquisition. If the initial approach is rejected or ignored, the acquiring company may reach out to shareholders directly.

### Due Diligence
Once the target company shows interest, a period of due diligence ensues, where the acquiring company thoroughly examines the target's financial records, operations, and other critical aspects. This phase helps the acquiring company to validate its offer and may lead to adjustments in the bid.

### Negotiation or Resistance
If the target company is open to discussion, negotiations will take place to finalize the terms of the deal. However, if the target company resists, the acquiring firm may pursue a hostile takeover by appealing directly to the shareholders or initiating a proxy fight.

### Hostile Takeover
In cases where the target company’s board rejects the unsolicited bid, the acquiring company can go hostile. This means it bypasses the board and takes the proposal directly to the shareholders, often offering a premium over the current market price for their shares.

## Examples

### Kraft Heinz and Unilever
In 2017, Kraft Heinz made an unsolicited $143 billion bid for Unilever. The proposal was quickly rejected by Unilever's board, which described the offer as undervaluing the company. Although Kraft Heinz initially considered a hostile bid, it eventually withdrew its offer in the face of strong resistance.

### Oracle and PeopleSoft
In 2003, Oracle initiated an unsolicited bid to acquire PeopleSoft. Despite multiple rejections and legal challenges, Oracle persisted and eventually succeeded in acquiring PeopleSoft for $10.3 billion in a hostile takeover. The prolonged battle highlighted the complexities and potential animosities involved in unsolicited bids.

## Legal and Regulatory Considerations

### Disclosure Requirements
Public companies are required to disclose material events, including unsolicited bids, to their shareholders and regulatory bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States. This transparency aims to protect investors and ensure they have access to pertinent information.

### Anti-Takeover Provisions
Many companies have anti-takeover mechanisms in place, such as poison pills, staggered boards, and golden parachutes, to defend against unsolicited bids. These provisions can make it significantly more difficult and costly for an acquiring firm to gain control.

### Shareholder Rights
Shareholders have the ultimate say in most takeover battles. Proxy fights and tender offers are common tactics used to sway shareholder opinion. Shareholders' rights and interests are protected by various regulations, ensuring they have an orderly and informed decision-making process.

## Impact on Stakeholders

### Shareholders
Unsolicited bids often result in immediate stock price spikes for the target company, as markets react to the potential acquisition premium. However, if a bid fails, the stock price can drop back to pre-offer levels. Long-term impacts depend on the success of the integration and realization of synergies if the acquisition goes through.

### Employees
For employees of the target company, unsolicited bids can create significant uncertainty regarding job security, roles, and corporate culture. The potential for restructuring or layoffs often accompanies such bids, especially in hostile takeovers.

### Customers and Partners
Customer and partner relationships may also be impacted. Concerns about service continuity, changes in product offerings, and shifts in company policy can arise, affecting customer loyalty and business partnerships.

## Strategic Considerations for Companies

### Defensive Strategies
Companies that wish to protect themselves from unsolicited bids can adopt various defensive strategies. These include building a stronger, more diversified business model, maintaining a loyal shareholder base, and implementing anti-takeover provisions.

### Responding to an Unsolicited Bid
When faced with an unsolicited bid, boards must quickly assemble a team of advisors, including investment bankers, legal counsel, and public relations experts, to assess the offer and formulate a response. This team assists in evaluating the bid’s merits, exploring alternative offers, and communicating effectively with stakeholders.

## Conclusion

Unsolicited bids are complex and high-stakes maneuvers in the corporate world, involving multiple stakeholders and potentially significant financial implications. Companies must be vigilant and strategic in both pursuing and defending against such bids, ensuring they act in the best interest of their shareholders and long-term value creation.

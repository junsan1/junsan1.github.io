# Unsolicited Bid

An unsolicited [bid](../b/bid.md) is a proposal made by one company to acquire another, which is not actively seeking a buyer. Unlike a friendly or negotiated [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md), an unsolicited [bid](../b/bid.md) comes as a surprise to the target company's management and board of directors. This type of [bid](../b/bid.md) can lead to a [hostile takeover](../h/hostile_takeover.md), where the acquiring company proceeds with the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) despite resistance from the target company’s [leadership](../l/leadership.md).

## Key Characteristics

### Surprise Element
One of the most defining aspects of an unsolicited [bid](../b/bid.md) is its unexpected nature. The target company's management is usually caught off guard, having had no prior discussions or negotiations with the acquiring entity.

### Strategic Acquisition
Acquiring companies often pursue unsolicited bids when they see significant strategic [value](../v/value.md) in owning the target company. This could be due to operational efficiencies, [market](../m/market.md) [expansion](../e/expansion.md), access to proprietary technologies, or other synergistic benefits.

### Public Announcement
In many cases, the acquiring company makes its intentions public to pressure the target company's shareholders and management into considering the [offer](../o/offer.md). This can be done through a press release, publicizing the terms and benefits of the proposed [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md).

### Decision Pressure
The unsolicited nature of the [bid](../b/bid.md) puts immediate pressure on the target company’s board of directors to evaluate the [offer](../o/offer.md), often under a tight deadline. The board must weigh the unsolicited [bid](../b/bid.md) against the company's standalone strategic plan and any potential alternative offers.

## Process and Stages

### Initial Offer
Often referred to as the "[bear hug](../b/bear_hug.md)," the initial [offer](../o/offer.md) is typically communicated directly to the target company’s board of directors in a formal letter outlining the terms and benefits of the proposed [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md). If the initial approach is rejected or ignored, the acquiring company may reach out to shareholders directly.

### Due Diligence
Once the target company shows [interest](../i/interest.md), a period of [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md) ensues, where the acquiring company thoroughly examines the target's financial records, operations, and other critical aspects. This phase helps the acquiring company to validate its [offer](../o/offer.md) and may lead to adjustments in the [bid](../b/bid.md).

### Negotiation or Resistance
If the target company is [open](../o/open.md) to discussion, negotiations [will](../w/will.md) take place to finalize the terms of the deal. However, if the target company resists, the acquiring [firm](../f/firm.md) may pursue a [hostile takeover](../h/hostile_takeover.md) by appealing directly to the shareholders or initiating a [proxy fight](../p/proxy_fight.md).

### Hostile Takeover
In cases where the target company’s board rejects the unsolicited [bid](../b/bid.md), the acquiring company can go hostile. This means it bypasses the board and takes the proposal directly to the shareholders, often [offering](../o/offering.md) a [premium](../p/premium.md) over the current [market price](../m/market_price.md) for their [shares](../s/shares.md).

## Examples

### Kraft Heinz and Unilever
In 2017, Kraft Heinz made an unsolicited $143 billion [bid](../b/bid.md) for Unilever. The proposal was quickly rejected by Unilever's board, which described the [offer](../o/offer.md) as undervaluing the company. Although Kraft Heinz initially considered a [hostile bid](../h/hostile_bid.md), it eventually withdrew its [offer](../o/offer.md) in the face of strong resistance.

### Oracle and PeopleSoft
In 2003, Oracle initiated an unsolicited [bid](../b/bid.md) to acquire PeopleSoft. Despite [multiple](../m/multiple.md) rejections and legal challenges, Oracle persisted and eventually succeeded in acquiring PeopleSoft for $10.3 billion in a [hostile takeover](../h/hostile_takeover.md). The prolonged battle highlighted the complexities and potential animosities involved in unsolicited bids.

## Legal and Regulatory Considerations

### Disclosure Requirements
Public companies are required to disclose material events, including unsolicited bids, to their shareholders and regulatory bodies such as the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) in the United States. This [transparency](../t/transparency.md) aims to protect investors and ensure they have access to pertinent information.

### Anti-Takeover Provisions
Many companies have anti-[takeover](../t/takeover.md) mechanisms in place, such as poison pills, staggered boards, and golden parachutes, to defend against unsolicited bids. These provisions can make it significantly more difficult and costly for an acquiring [firm](../f/firm.md) to [gain](../g/gain.md) control.

### Shareholder Rights
Shareholders have the ultimate say in most [takeover](../t/takeover.md) battles. [Proxy](../p/proxy.md) fights and [tender](../t/tender.md) offers are common tactics used to sway [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) opinion. Shareholders' rights and interests are protected by various regulations, ensuring they have an orderly and informed decision-making process.

## Impact on Stakeholders

### Shareholders
Unsolicited bids often result in immediate stock price spikes for the target company, as markets react to the potential [acquisition premium](../a/acquisition_premium.md). However, if a [bid](../b/bid.md) fails, the stock price can drop back to pre-[offer](../o/offer.md) levels. Long-term impacts depend on the success of the integration and realization of synergies if the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) goes through.

### Employees
For employees of the target company, unsolicited bids can create significant [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) regarding job [security](../s/security.md), roles, and [corporate culture](../c/corporate_culture.md). The potential for [restructuring](../r/restructuring.md) or layoffs often accompanies such bids, especially in hostile takeovers.

### Customers and Partners
[Customer](../c/customer.md) and partner relationships may also be impacted. Concerns about service continuity, changes in product offerings, and shifts in company policy can arise, affecting [customer](../c/customer.md) loyalty and [business](../b/business.md) partnerships.

## Strategic Considerations for Companies

### Defensive Strategies
Companies that wish to protect themselves from unsolicited bids can adopt various defensive strategies. These include building a stronger, more diversified [business](../b/business.md) model, maintaining a loyal [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) base, and implementing anti-[takeover](../t/takeover.md) provisions.

### Responding to an Unsolicited Bid
When faced with an unsolicited [bid](../b/bid.md), boards must quickly assemble a team of advisors, including investment bankers, legal counsel, and public relations experts, to assess the [offer](../o/offer.md) and formulate a response. This team assists in evaluating the [bid](../b/bid.md)’s merits, exploring alternative offers, and communicating effectively with stakeholders.

## Conclusion

Unsolicited bids are complex and high-stakes maneuvers in the corporate world, involving [multiple](../m/multiple.md) stakeholders and potentially significant financial implications. Companies must be vigilant and strategic in both pursuing and defending against such bids, ensuring they act in the best [interest](../i/interest.md) of their shareholders and long-term [value](../v/value.md) creation.

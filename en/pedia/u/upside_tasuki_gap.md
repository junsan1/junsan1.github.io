# Upside Tasuki Gap

The [Upside](../u/upside.md) Tasuki Gap is a [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) pattern used in [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) within the realm of trading and [finance](../f/finance.md). Originating from Japanese [candlestick charting techniques](../c/candlestick_charting_techniques.md), this pattern is known for its ability to signal potential continuation of an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md) in [asset](../a/asset.md) prices. It is a relatively easy-to-identify pattern that comprises three specific candles, each with distinct characteristics.

## Components of an Upside Tasuki Gap

### Candle 1: Bullish Candle
The first candle in the [Upside](../u/upside.md) Tasuki Gap pattern is a bullish candle, which signifies that the closing price is higher than the [opening price](../o/opening_price.md). This candle indicates an ongoing upward [momentum](../m/momentum.md) in [asset](../a/asset.md) prices.

### Candle 2: Bullish Gap Candle
The second candle is also bullish and opens higher than the closing price of the first candle, creating a gap. This "gap" refers to the space on the chart where no trading has occurred, indicating a strong continuation of the buying pressure.

### Candle 3: Bearish or Neutral Candle
The third candle in the pattern is either bearish (closing below its [opening price](../o/opening_price.md)) or [neutral](../n/neutral.md). This candle opens within the body of the second candle but does not fill the gap created between the first and the second candles. The inability to fill the gap signifies that the bullish [momentum](../m/momentum.md) is still intact.

## Significance in Trading

The [Upside](../u/upside.md) Tasuki Gap is primarily used to confirm that an existing bullish [trend](../t/trend.md) [will](../w/will.md) likely continue. Traders view this pattern as an indication of persistent buying pressure, which discourages short-sellers and attracts further buying [interest](../i/interest.md).

### Bullish Continuation Signal
The main takeaway from identifying an [Upside](../u/upside.md) Tasuki Gap on a [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) chart is that it typically forecasts a continuation of the current [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md). The inability of the third candle to fully close the gap created by the second candle implies that the bears are not strong enough to reverse the current bullish sentiment.

## Practical Application

### Identifying the Pattern
To effectively use the [Upside](../u/upside.md) Tasuki Gap pattern in trading, one must first be able to spot it on a [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) chart. Here’s a step-by-step process:
1. **Confirm the [Uptrend](../u/uptrend.md)**: Ensure that the [asset](../a/asset.md) is in an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md) by examining the broader chart. 
2. **Identify the First Bullish Candle**: Locate a bullish candle within the [trend](../t/trend.md).
3. **Spot the Gap**: The second candle should [open](../o/open.md) above the first candle’s close, creating a gap.
4. **Assess the Third Candle**: The third candle should [open](../o/open.md) within the body of the second candle but not close the gap entirely.

### Combining with Other Indicators
The reliability of the [Upside](../u/upside.md) Tasuki Gap can be enhanced by using it in conjunction with other [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicator.md) such as:
- **Moving Averages**: To confirm the [trend](../t/trend.md) direction.
- **[Volume Analysis](../v/volume_analysis.md)**: To gauge the strength behind the pattern. Higher volumes during the formation of the pattern add credibility.
- **[Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (RSI)**: To assess [overbought](../o/overbought.md) or [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions.

## Example Scenario

Consider a scenario where the stock of company XYZ has been in an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md). Upon examining the [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) chart, you identify the following:
1. **First Candle**: A green (bullish) candle closing higher than it opened.
2. **Second Candle**: Another green candle that opens higher than the first candle’s close, creating a visible gap.
3. **Third Candle**: A small red (or [neutral](../n/neutral.md)) candle that opens within the body of the second candle but does not close the gap.

Given this pattern, a [trader](../t/trader.md) might decide to go long, anticipating the continuation of the [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md).

## Conclusion

The [Upside](../u/upside.md) Tasuki Gap is a valuable pattern for traders looking to [leverage](../l/leverage.md) [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) for better decision-making in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). Although it is not infallible, when correctly identified and used in conjunction with other [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicator.md), it can significantly enhance the probability of making profitable trades. As with all [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), it is crucial to use this pattern within the context of broader [market](../m/market.md) conditions and to apply adequate [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices.

# Unlisted Stock Market

### Introduction
The unlisted stock market pertains to the realm of securities that are not available on formal exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or NASDAQ. This market plays a crucial role in the financial ecosystem, providing opportunities for businesses to raise capital and for investors to diversify their portfolios. Unlisted stocks are often traded in over-the-counter (OTC) markets or through alternative [trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md) (ATS).

### Characteristics of Unlisted Stocks
Unlisted stocks differ from their listed counterparts in several distinct ways:
1. **Regulation**: Unlisted stocks are subject to less stringent regulatory requirements compared to listed stocks. Information disclosure and reporting standards are often lower.
2. **Liquidity**: Generally, unlisted stocks have lower liquidity. They are traded less frequently, meaning buying or selling in large quantities can affect the price significantly.
3. **Market Access**: Unlisted stocks are harder to access for the average investor. They often require dealing with brokers who have access to OTC markets.
4. **Valuation**: Valuing unlisted stocks can be more complex due to the lack of readily available market prices and comprehensive financial data.

### Methods of Trading Unlisted Stocks
Unlisted stocks can be traded through two primary methods: over-the-counter (OTC) markets and alternative [trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md) (ATS).

#### Over-The-Counter (OTC) Markets
OTC markets involve the trading of securities directly between parties without a central exchange. Examples of OTC markets include:
- **OTC Bulletin Board (OTCBB)**: A regulated quotation medium for mainly small or microcap companies, which are subject to more regulations than those on the Pink Sheets.
- **Pink Sheets**: This platform lists a wide array of securities including [penny stocks](../p/penny_stocks.md). Companies listed on Pink Sheets are not required to meet any specific standards or file any specific reports, making it riskier for investors.

#### Alternative Trading Systems (ATS)
ATS are non-exchange trading venues that match buyers and sellers of securities. They are regulated as broker-dealers. One significant example is the **Electronic Communication Network (ECN)**, which provides an automated system for larger investors to trade unlisted stocks.

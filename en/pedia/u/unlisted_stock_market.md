# Unlisted Stock Market

### Introduction
The unlisted [stock market](../s/stock_market.md) pertains to the realm of securities that are not available on formal exchanges such as the New York Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (NYSE) or [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md). This [market](../m/market.md) plays a crucial role in the financial ecosystem, providing opportunities for businesses to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) and for investors to diversify their portfolios. Unlisted [stocks](../s/stock.md) are often traded in [over-the-counter (OTC) markets](../o/over-the-counter_markets.md) or through alternative [trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md) (ATS).

### Characteristics of Unlisted Stocks
Unlisted [stocks](../s/stock.md) differ from their [listed](../l/listed.md) counterparts in several distinct ways:
1. **Regulation**: Unlisted [stocks](../s/stock.md) are subject to less stringent regulatory requirements compared to [listed](../l/listed.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md). Information [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) and reporting standards are often lower.
2. **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)**: Generally, unlisted [stocks](../s/stock.md) have lower [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md). They are traded less frequently, meaning buying or selling in large quantities can affect the price significantly.
3. **[Market](../m/market.md) Access**: Unlisted [stocks](../s/stock.md) are harder to access for the average [investor](../i/investor.md). They often require dealing with brokers who have access to OTC markets.
4. **[Valuation](../v/valuation.md)**: Valuing unlisted [stocks](../s/stock.md) can be more complex due to the lack of readily available [market](../m/market.md) prices and comprehensive financial data.

### Methods of Trading Unlisted Stocks
Unlisted [stocks](../s/stock.md) can be traded through two primary methods: [over-the-counter (OTC) markets](../o/over-the-counter_markets.md) and alternative [trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md) (ATS).

#### Over-The-Counter (OTC) Markets
OTC markets involve the trading of securities directly between parties without a central [exchange](../e/exchange.md). Examples of OTC markets include:
- **OTC Bulletin Board (OTCBB)**: A regulated [quotation](../q/quotation.md) medium for mainly small or microcap companies, which are subject to more regulations than those on the [Pink Sheets](../p/pink_sheets.md).
- **[Pink Sheets](../p/pink_sheets.md)**: This platform lists a wide array of securities including [penny stocks](../p/penny_stocks.md). Companies [listed](../l/listed.md) on [Pink Sheets](../p/pink_sheets.md) are not required to meet any specific standards or file any specific reports, making it riskier for investors.

#### Alternative Trading Systems (ATS)
ATS are non-[exchange](../e/exchange.md) trading venues that match buyers and sellers of securities. They are regulated as [broker](../b/broker.md)-dealers. One significant example is the **[Electronic Communication Network](../e/electronic_communication_network.md) (ECN)**, which provides an automated system for larger investors to [trade](../t/trade.md) unlisted [stocks](../s/stock.md).

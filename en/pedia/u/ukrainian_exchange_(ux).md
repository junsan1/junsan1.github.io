The UX plays a crucial role in the Ukrainian economy by enabling the trading of stocks, bonds, derivatives, and other financial instruments.

## Historical Background
The Ukrainian Exchange was established in May 2008, amidst heightened demand for a more advanced trading platform in Ukraine. Before UX, the PFTS Stock Exchange was the predominant platform, but it lacked the technological advancements and trading mechanisms that modern investors required. Hence, UX was created to fill this void and provide a much-needed boost to Ukraine's capital markets.

### Derivatives
UX was a pioneer in introducing derivatives trading in Ukraine. This includes futures and options, which allow investors to hedge risks and speculate on market movements.

## Trading Mechanisms
The Ukrainian Exchange employs modern trading mechanisms, including:

### Order-Driven Market
UX operates predominantly as an order-driven market where buy and sell orders are matched in an order book. The best buy and sell orders are matched based on price and time priority.

### Market-Maker System
To ensure liquidity, UX employs a market-maker system. Market-makers are obligated to provide buy and sell quotes for specific securities, hence assuring liquidity even in less active trading periods.

Companies listed on the UX are required to provide regular financial disclosures and comply with numerous regulatory requirements. This ensures a high level of transparency and protects investor interests.

## Algorithms and High-Frequency Trading (HFT)
The UX's advanced technology infrastructure makes it suitable for algorithmic and high-frequency trading. These trading strategies rely on automated systems to execute trades at extremely high speeds, taking advantage of minor price fluctuations.

### Algorithmic Trading
Algorithmic trading involves using pre-set computer programs to execute trades based on specified criteria, such as time, price, or volume.

### High-Frequency Trading
High-frequency trading (HFT) takes algorithmic trading a step further by executing a large number of orders at very high speeds. This requires a robust infrastructure capable of handling significant amounts of data with minimal latency.

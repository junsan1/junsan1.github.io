# United Nations Global Compact

The United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) is a voluntary initiative designed to encourage companies worldwide to adopt sustainable and socially responsible policies, and to report on their implementation. It is the world's largest corporate sustainability initiative with over 10,000 companies and 3,000 non-[business](../b/business.md) participants from more than 160 countries.

## Background

Launched in July 2000, the UNGC aims to align [business](../b/business.md) operations and strategies with ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption. The initiative is a call to companies to align strategies and operations with universal principles on human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption, and take actions that advance societal goals.

## The Principles of UNGC

The UNGC is centered around ten core principles that fall under four broad categories:

### Human Rights

1. **Principle 1:** Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights.
2. **Principle 2:** Make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses.

### Labor

3. **Principle 3:** Businesses should [uphold](../u/uphold.md) the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining.
4. **Principle 4:** The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor.
5. **Principle 5:** The effective abolition of child labor.
6. **Principle 6:** The elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.

### Environment

7. **Principle 7:** Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges.
8. **Principle 8:** Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility.
9. **Principle 9:** Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies.

### Anti-Corruption

10. **Principle 10:** Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery.

## Participation and Reporting

Companies that join the UNGC are expected to:

- Set in motion changes to [business](../b/business.md) operations so that the UNGC principles become part of management strategy, daily operations, and organizational culture.
- Publicly advocate the UNGC and its principles.
- Communicate annually on progress (COP) in implementing the ten principles and, where applicable, engage in partnerships to advance broader UN goals, such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The Communication on Progress (COP) is a [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) to stakeholders on progress in integrating the Ten Principles into operations, which encourages [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and accountability.

## Impact and Global Influence

The UNGC has had significant influence on corporate policies and practices worldwide. It has fostered [public-private partnerships](../p/public-private_partnerships.md), driven businesses to adopt more sustainable practices, and raised awareness of issues like climate change, human rights, and labor standards in the corporate sector.

Some notable impacts include:

- Integration of the UNGC principles into corporate strategies leads to better [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) and identification of opportunities.
- Greater emphasis on sustainability reporting and [transparency](../t/transparency.md).
- Promotion of sustainable development through collaborative initiatives and partnerships.

The UNGC facilitates a variety of platforms and working groups where companies can collaborate, share [best practices](../b/best_practices.md), and develop solutions to global and sector-specific challenges.

## Criticism and Challenges

Despite its positive influence, the UNGC has faced criticism:

- **Voluntary Nature:** Critics argue that because the UNGC is voluntary and lacks enforcement mechanisms, some companies might join merely for branding purposes without making substantive changes.
- **Reporting Quality:** The quality and rigor of COP reports can vary significantly between companies, impeding the ability to evaluate genuine progress.

## Innovations and Future Directions

The UNGC continues to evolve with the global sustainability agenda. Key directions include:

- **Alignment with the SDGs:** The UNGC aligns corporate sustainability efforts with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), enabling businesses to contribute to global development objectives.
- **Innovation and Technology:** Encouraging the adoption of innovative technologies to address sustainability challenges and improve reporting mechanisms.
- **Regional and Local Networks:** Expanded efforts to build regional and local networks to facilitate more targeted and impactful action.

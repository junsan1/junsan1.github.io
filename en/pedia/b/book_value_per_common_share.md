# Book Value Per Common Share

[Book Value](../b/book_value.md) Per Common Share (BVPS) is a financial measure that represents the per-share [value](../v/value.md) of a company's [equity](../e/equity.md) available to common shareholders. It is an important metric used by investors to assess the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [value](../v/value.md) of a company's [shares](../s/shares.md) and can provide insights into whether a stock is over or [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) relative to its [book value](../b/book_value.md). BVPS is fundamentally a way to understand the tangible book assets on a per-share [basis](../b/basis.md) and thus offers a reality [check](../c/check.md) against the [market price](../m/market_price.md) of the [shares](../s/shares.md).

## Definition and Formula
The [Book Value](../b/book_value.md) Per Common Share is calculated by dividing the common [equity](../e/equity.md) by the number of outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md). The formula is as follows:

\[ \text{BVPS} = \frac{\text{Common [Equity](../e/equity.md)}}{\text{Number of Outstanding [Shares](../s/shares.md)}} \]

Where:
- **Common [Equity](../e/equity.md)** is the total [equity](../e/equity.md) held by common shareholders, calculated as total assets minus [total liabilities](../t/total_liabilities.md) and [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md).
- **Number of Outstanding [Shares](../s/shares.md)** is the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) that are currently held by all shareholders.

## Components of BVPS
1. **Common [Equity](../e/equity.md)**: This is derived from the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) and represents the portion of the company's [equity](../e/equity.md) that is owned by common shareholders. It includes [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md), contributed [surplus](../s/surplus.md), and share [capital](../c/capital.md) after [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for preferred [equity](../e/equity.md).
2. **Outstanding [Shares](../s/shares.md)**: These are the [shares](../s/shares.md) currently owned by investors, including institutional investors, retail investors, and company insiders but excluding treasury [shares](../s/shares.md).

## Importance of BVPS
BVPS is a critical figure for investors for several reasons:
- **[Valuation](../v/valuation.md) Metric**: BVPS provides a [basis](../b/basis.md) for [valuation](../v/valuation.md), especially when comparing the share price to the [book value](../b/book_value.md). A stock trading below its BVPS might be considered [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md).
- **[Financial Health](../f/financial_health.md)**: A higher BVPS can indicate a company's strong [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and ability to generate [shareholder value](../s/shareholder_value.md).
- **Investment Decisions**: Investors often use BVPS along with other [financial ratios](../f/financial_ratios.md) to make informed investment decisions.
- **Benchmarking**: Comparing a company's BVPS to [industry](../i/industry.md) peers can highlight its relative performance.

## Interpretation of BVPS
### Overvaluation and Undervaluation
- **[Overvalued](../o/overvalued.md)**: If a stock's [market price](../m/market_price.md) is significantly higher than its BVPS, it could indicate that the stock is [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md). This could be due to high [market](../m/market.md) expectations or speculative trades.
- **[Undervalued](../u/undervalued.md)**: Conversely, if a stock’s [market price](../m/market_price.md) is significantly lower than its BVPS, it might be [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md). This could indicate a potential investment opportunity if the [market](../m/market.md) has overlooked its [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md).

### Growth and BVPS
- **Growing BVPS**: A company that consistently grows its BVPS might be doing so through effective [reinvestment](../r/reinvestment.md) of profits and careful financial management. This is a positive [indicator](../i/indicator.md) for long-term investors.
- **Declining BVPS**: A declining BVPS might suggest the company is experiencing financial difficulties, has taken on excessive [debt](../d/debt.md), or has issued more [shares](../s/shares.md), diluting the [value](../v/value.md) for existing shareholders.

## Practical Use Cases
### Value Investing
[Value](../v/value.md) investors are particularly interested in BVPS as it helps them identify [stocks](../s/stock.md) that are trading below their [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md). By comparing the [market price](../m/market_price.md) with BVPS and considering other metrics like the price-to-book ratio, [value](../v/value.md) investors can spot potential investment opportunities.

### Credit Analysis
Lenders and analysts use BVPS to evaluate a company's [book value](../b/book_value.md) to understand its financial stability. A company with a higher BVPS might be viewed as having more financial stability and a lower [risk](../r/risk.md) of [default](../d/default.md).

### Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A)
In M&A activities, companies often assess each other's [book value](../b/book_value.md) to determine fair valuations. BVPS helps in negotiating the terms of a [merger](../m/merger.md) or [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md), ensuring that the deal is equitable for both parties.

## Real-World Example
### Example Calculation
Let’s assume Company ABC has the following financial details:
- Total Assets: $10,000,000
- [Total Liabilities](../t/total_liabilities.md): $6,000,000
- [Preferred Stock](../p/preferred_stock.md): $1,000,000
- Number of Outstanding [Shares](../s/shares.md): 1,000,000

First, calculate the common [equity](../e/equity.md):
\[ \text{Common Equity} = \text{Total Assets} - \text{[Total Liabilities](../t/total_liabilities.md)} - \text{[Preferred Stock](../p/preferred_stock.md)} \]
\[ \text{Common [Equity](../e/equity.md)} = \$10,000,000 - \$6,000,000 - \$1,000,000 = \$3,000,000 \]

Next, determine the BVPS:
\[ \text{BVPS} = \frac{\$3,000,000}{1,000,000} = \$3.00 \]

Therefore, the BVPS of Company ABC is $3.00.

## Case Studies
### Berkshire Hathaway
[Berkshire Hathaway](../b/berkshire_hathaway.md), led by Warren Buffett, often emphasizes the importance of [book value](../b/book_value.md) per share. By focusing on companies with strong BVPS growth, [Berkshire Hathaway](../b/berkshire_hathaway.md) has achieved impressive long-term returns. More information about their investment philosophy related to BVPS can be found on their [official website](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/).

### Apple Inc.
Apple Inc.’s BVPS can be significantly influenced by its massive share [buyback](../b/buyback.md) programs. By reducing the number of outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md), Apple has effectively increased its BVPS over time, providing more [value](../v/value.md) to the remaining shareholders. Details and financial information can be found on their [investor relations page](https://investor.apple.com/).

## Advantages and Limitations of BVPS
### Advantages
1. **Tangible Measure**: BVPS provides a tangible measure of a company’s net [asset](../a/asset.md) [value](../v/value.md), making it a reliable figure for [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md).
2. **[Benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for [Valuation](../v/valuation.md)**: It serves as a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for comparing the [market](../m/market.md) [valuation](../v/valuation.md) of similar companies.
3. **[Indicator](../i/indicator.md) of [Financial Health](../f/financial_health.md)**: A higher BVPS generally indicates that a company is financially sound and can create [shareholder value](../s/shareholder_value.md).

### Limitations
1. **Not Reflecting [Market Value](../m/market_value.md)**: BVPS does not reflect the [market value](../m/market_value.md) of intangible assets like patents, brands, and intellectual property, which can be significant for technology and pharmaceutical companies.
2. **Historical Data**: BVPS is based on [historical cost](../h/historical_cost.md) and does not account for the current [market value](../m/market_value.md) of the assets.
3. **[Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) Effects**: The measure can be influenced by [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) policies, potentially underestimating the true [value](../v/value.md) of assets.
4. **Not Suitable for All Sectors**: Sectors with significant intangible assets may not get an accurate representation through BVPS.

## Conclusion
[Book Value](../b/book_value.md) Per Common Share is a fundamental financial metric that provides insights into the per-share [value](../v/value.md) of a company’s [equity](../e/equity.md) available to common shareholders. While it has various applications in [investment analysis](../i/investment_analysis.md), [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) assessment, and M&A activities, it is essential to consider its limitations. Investors should use BVPS in conjunction with other financial metrics to make well-rounded investment decisions.

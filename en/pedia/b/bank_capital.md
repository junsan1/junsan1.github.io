# Bank Capital

[Bank](../b/bank.md) [capital](../c/capital.md) represents the financial resources that banks [hold](../h/hold.md) as a cushion against [insolvency](../i/insolvency.md), ensuring they can absorb losses while continuing their operations. It is a critical element in the [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) of banking institutions, maintaining stability in the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md) and protecting depositors. This extensive discussion focuses on different aspects of [bank](../b/bank.md) [capital](../c/capital.md), including its definition, components, regulatory requirements, and importance.

## Definition of Bank Capital
[Bank](../b/bank.md) [capital](../c/capital.md) refers to the difference between a [bank](../b/bank.md)’s assets and liabilities. It represents the [bank](../b/bank.md)'s [net worth](../n/net_worth.md) and includes shareholders' [equity](../e/equity.md), [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md), and certain types of [debt](../d/debt.md). Essentially, it serves as a buffer to absorb potential losses from non-performing loans or other financial difficulties.

## Components of Bank Capital
[Bank](../b/bank.md) [capital](../c/capital.md) comprises various elements, segregated primarily into two tiers:

### Tier 1 Capital
Also known as core [capital](../c/capital.md), [Tier 1 capital](../t/tier_1_capital.md) includes:
- **Common [Equity](../e/equity.md) Tier 1 (CET1)**: This includes common [shares](../s/shares.md) and [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md). Common [shares](../s/shares.md) are the most straightforward and reliable form of [capital](../c/capital.md), providing a clear picture of a [bank](../b/bank.md)’s financial strength.
- **Additional Tier 1 (AT1)**: This includes instruments like non-cumulative [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md) and [contingent convertible](../c/contingent_convertible.md) bonds (CoCos), which can be converted into [equity](../e/equity.md) or written down in times of distress.

### Tier 2 Capital
Supplementary [capital](../c/capital.md), or Tier 2, includes:
- **[Subordinated debt](../s/subordinated_debt.md)**: [Debt](../d/debt.md) instruments that are subordinate to other debts in case of [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md).
- **Hybrid [capital](../c/capital.md) instruments**: Instruments that exhibit characteristics of both [debt](../d/debt.md) and [equity](../e/equity.md).
- **[Loan](../l/loan.md) loss reserves**: Provisions that banks set aside to cover potential [loan](../l/loan.md) losses.

## Regulatory Requirements
[Bank](../b/bank.md) [capital](../c/capital.md) is heavily regulated to ensure financial stability. Different jurisdictions have their regulatory frameworks, but many align with the [Basel Accords](../b/basel_accords.md) developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS).

### Basel I
Introduced in 1988, [Basel I](../b/basel_i.md) established minimum [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements focusing on [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md). It mandated that banks maintain a minimum [capital](../c/capital.md)-to-[risk-weighted assets](../r/risk-weighted_assets.md) ratio (CRAR) of 8%.

### Basel II
Introduced in 2004, [Basel II](../b/basel_ii.md) enhanced the framework by incorporating [operational risk](../o/operational_risk.md) and refining the standard for [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md). It introduced three pillars:
1. **Minimum [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements**: Maintains the minimum CRAR of 8%.
2. **Supervisory review process**: Ensures banks have adequate [capital](../c/capital.md) to support all major risks.
3. **[Market](../m/market.md) discipline**: Improves [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md).

### Basel III
Following the 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md), [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md) was introduced to enhance the banking sector’s ability to absorb shocks. Key features include:
- **Higher minimum [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements**: Increased the CET1 requirement to 4.5% of [risk-weighted assets](../r/risk-weighted_assets.md), plus a [capital](../c/capital.md) conservation buffer of 2.5%.
- **[Leverage ratio](../l/leverage_ratio.md)**: Introduced a non-[risk](../r/risk.md) based [leverage ratio](../l/leverage_ratio.md) to avoid excessive on- and off-[balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) [leverage](../l/leverage.md).
- **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) requirements**: Implemented [Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) [Coverage Ratio](../c/coverage_ratio.md) (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) to ensure banks maintain adequate high-quality [liquid](../l/liquid.md) assets and stable funding sources.

## Importance of Bank Capital
[Bank](../b/bank.md) [capital](../c/capital.md) is indispensable for several reasons:

### Absorbing Losses
[Capital](../c/capital.md) acts as a shock absorber, allowing banks to withstand financial losses without facing [insolvency](../i/insolvency.md). This is crucial for maintaining depositors’ confidence and overall financial stability.

### Financial Stability
Sufficient [capital](../c/capital.md) levels contribute to the stability of the broader [financial system](../f/financial_system.md). It ensures banks remain solvent during periods of [financial distress](../f/financial_distress.md), reducing the [risk](../r/risk.md) of [bank](../b/bank.md) runs and systemic crises.

### Regulatory Compliance
Meeting regulatory [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements is mandatory for banks to operate. Non-compliance can lead to sanctions, restricted operations, or even closure by authorities.

### Creditworthiness
Strong [capital](../c/capital.md) levels enhance a [bank](../b/bank.md)'s [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) by indicating a solid financial foundation. This can lower borrowing costs and provide a [competitive advantage](../c/competitive_advantage.md) in attracting customers and investors.

### Market Confidence
Adequate [capital](../c/capital.md) fosters [market](../m/market.md) confidence. Investors and customers are more likely to engage with a well-capitalized [bank](../b/bank.md), knowing their funds are safer compared to institutions with weaker [capital](../c/capital.md) positions.

## Challenges in Maintaining Adequate Capital
Maintaining sufficient [capital](../c/capital.md) levels can be challenging for banks due to various factors, including economic fluctuations, regulatory changes, and operational risks.

### Economic Cycles
During economic downturns, the [value](../v/value.md) of [bank](../b/bank.md) assets may decline, leading to reduced [capital](../c/capital.md) levels. Conversely, in prosperous times, banks may experience [capital](../c/capital.md) surpluses but also face increased pressure to maximize returns.

### Regulatory Changes
Frequent changes in regulatory requirements can strain banks' resources. Adapting to new [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements, such as those under [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md), requires substantial financial and operational adjustments.

### Operational Risks
Banks face numerous operational risks, including [fraud](../f/fraud.md), cyber-attacks, and compliance breaches. These risks can lead to significant financial losses, impacting [capital](../c/capital.md) reserves.

### Balancing Profitability and Safety
Banks aim to maximize profits while maintaining adequate [capital](../c/capital.md) levels. Striking this balance is complex, as higher [capital](../c/capital.md) reduces potential returns but ensures greater safety and compliance.

## Methods of Raising Bank Capital
Banks can employ several methods to raise [capital](../c/capital.md), including:

### Equity Issuance
Raising [equity](../e/equity.md) [capital](../c/capital.md) by issuing new [shares](../s/shares.md) is a common approach. It dilutes existing shareholders' ownership but strengthens the [capital](../c/capital.md) base without increasing [debt](../d/debt.md).

### Retained Earnings
Reinvesting profits back into the [bank](../b/bank.md) enhances [capital](../c/capital.md) organically. This method is sustainable over the long term but relies on consistent profitability.

### Debt Instruments
Issuing [subordinated debt](../s/subordinated_debt.md) or convertible bonds can raise [capital](../c/capital.md) while providing tax benefits on [interest](../i/interest.md) payments. However, it increases financial [leverage](../l/leverage.md) and [obligations](../o/obligation.md).

### Asset Sales
Banks can sell non-core assets to quickly bolster [capital](../c/capital.md). While effective, this approach may deplete long-term [revenue](../r/revenue.md)-generating assets.

### Government Bailouts
In adverse conditions, banks might receive [capital](../c/capital.md) injections from the government to stabilize their operations. This can prevent systemic crises but may imply partial [nationalization](../n/nationalization.md).

## Examples of Capital-Raising Strategies
Prominent banks have employed various [capital](../c/capital.md)-raising strategies to meet their regulatory requirements and strategic goals.

### JPMorgan Chase
JPMorgan Chase, one of the largest banks in the world, regularly issues both [equity](../e/equity.md) and [debt](../d/debt.md) instruments to manage its [capital](../c/capital.md) base. The [bank](../b/bank.md)'s [robust](../r/robust.md) [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md) also play a significant role in maintaining its [capital](../c/capital.md) levels. [JPMorgan Chase](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/)

### HSBC
HSBC, a global banking giant, often resorts to [asset](../a/asset.md) sales to raise [capital](../c/capital.md). Extensive divestitures in non-core markets have allowed it to fortify its [capital](../c/capital.md) reserves while focusing on strategic markets. [HSBC](https://www.hsbc.com/)

### Deutsche Bank
During [financial distress](../f/financial_distress.md), Deutsche [Bank](../b/bank.md) has raised [capital](../c/capital.md) by issuing new [shares](../s/shares.md) and converting hybrid instruments. Their approach has been pivotal in meeting [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md) requirements. [Deutsche Bank](https://www.db.com/)

### Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS)
Following the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md), RBS received substantial government bailouts, significantly stabilizing its [capital](../c/capital.md). The [bank](../b/bank.md) has since employed a mix of [equity](../e/equity.md) issuance and [asset](../a/asset.md) sales to enhance its [capital](../c/capital.md) position. [RBS](https://www.rbs.com/)

## Conclusion
[Bank](../b/bank.md) [capital](../c/capital.md) is a foundational element of banking stability and [financial system](../f/financial_system.md) integrity. Comprising various tiers, it serves as a buffer against losses, ensuring banks can weather [financial distress](../f/financial_distress.md). Regulatory frameworks, such as the [Basel Accords](../b/basel_accords.md), mandate stringent [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements to safeguard the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md). Maintaining adequate [capital](../c/capital.md) is challenging but critical, with banks employing diverse strategies to bolster their reserves. Prominent banks around the globe continuously refine their [capital](../c/capital.md) management practices to align with regulatory standards and strategic objectives, underscoring the importance of [robust](../r/robust.md) [bank](../b/bank.md) [capital](../c/capital.md) in sustaining economic stability.

# Brexit

## Introduction
Brexit, a portmanteau of "Britain" and "exit," refers to the United Kingdom's (UK) decision to leave the [European Union](../e/european_union_(eu).md) (EU), a socio-economic and political partnership involving 27 European countries. The term first gained prominence in the media, political discussions, and public discourse following the UK's 2016 referendum. The complex and divisive process of Brexit involves numerous legal, economic, and political layers and has far-reaching implications for both the UK and the EU.

## Historical Context
The UK's relationship with the EU has always been somewhat ambivalent, marked by periodic skepticism and debates over sovereignty. The UK joined the European Economic Community (EEC), a precursor to the EU, in 1973. Since then, it has wrestled with balancing national interests against the collective goals of the union. Issues such as [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md), migration, and regulations have often been contentious.

## The 2016 Referendum

### Vote Outcome
On June 23, 2016, the UK held a referendum to decide whether to remain in or leave the EU. Approximately 51.9% of voters opted to leave, while 48.1% voted to remain. The referendum showcased profound divides across regions, age groups, and socioeconomic classes. England and Wales largely voted to leave, whereas Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain.

### Key Influences on Voting
Several factors influenced voting behavior, including economic discontent, questions about national sovereignty, and concerns regarding immigration. Similarly, misinformation and populism played roles in shaping public opinion.

## Mechanisms of Brexit

### Article 50
The formal process of leaving the EU is set out in Article 50 of the Treaty on [European Union](../e/european_union_(eu).md). Once triggered, a country has two years to negotiate its departure. Former Prime Minister Theresa May invoked Article 50 on March 29, 2017, setting a departure date of March 29, 2019.

### Withdrawal Agreements
Negotiating a fair [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) agreement proved complex. Key issues included the rights of EU citizens in the UK and vice versa, financial settlements, and the contentious Northern Ireland border. The "Irish backstop" aimed to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland but faced substantial opposition.

## Political Turmoil

### Theresa May’s Tenure
Theresa May’s government struggled to secure parliamentary approval for her negotiated [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) agreement, facing opposition from various factions. After [multiple](../m/multiple.md) failed attempts, she resigned in July 2019.

### Boris Johnson’s Leadership
Boris Johnson, her successor, renegotiated certain elements of the deal, specifically concerning the Irish border. His "oven-ready" deal facilitated the UK's departure from the EU on January 31, 2020, with a transition period to December 31, 2020, to iron out future relationships.

## Economic Implications

### Trade Agreements
One of the most significant areas affected by Brexit is [trade](../t/trade.md). The UK needs to establish new [trade](../t/trade.md) agreements not only with the EU but also globally. The UK-EU [Trade](../t/trade.md) and Cooperation Agreement, finalized on December 24, 2020, governs [trade](../t/trade.md) relations, though it leaves many issues unresolved.

### Market Reaction
[Market](../m/market.md) reactions to Brexit have been volatile. The pound sterling plummeted following the referendum outcome and has experienced regular fluctuations since. Uncertainties around regulatory standards, tariffs, and investment have created apprehensions among businesses and [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

### Impact on Different Sectors
Different sectors experience Brexit’s impacts in varying degrees. For instance, financial services face barriers in cross-border transactions, while the fishing [industry](../i/industry.md) deals with new [quotas](../q/quota.md) and regulations. Similarly, SMEs might struggle with increased [export](../e/export.md) documentation and compliance costs.

## Social and Cultural Impact

### Immigration
A significant point of contention was immigration policy. Brexit has brought in stringent immigration rules, affecting both EU nationals in the UK and UK citizens in the EU. The new points-based immigration system emphasizes skills and job offers over free movement.

### National Unity
Brexit has deepened regional divides within the UK. Scotland’s vote to remain has rekindled talks of another independence referendum. Northern Ireland, too, grapples with its unique position, balancing allegiance to the UK and its practical and historical ties to the EU.

### International Relations
Brexit redefines the UK's place in global geopolitics. While aiming for sovereignty and control, the UK must now navigate its position diplomatically and economically, forging alliances outside the EU. Its role in NATO, the UN [Security](../s/security.md) Council, and relations with traditional allies like the US come under renewed focus.

### Public Sentiment
Public opinion on Brexit remains divided. Some view it as reclaiming independence, while others see it as a catastrophic mistake undermining economic stability and global standing.

## Legal Considerations

### Regulatory Divergence
The UK’s departure from the EU poses legal challenges. There’s a significant shift from EU regulations to UK-specific laws. This [divergence](../d/divergence.md) can affect everything from environmental standards to employment rights, necessitating businesses' and individuals' adaptability.

### Human Rights
Human rights frameworks, previously underpinned by EU charters and courts, face potential changes. The UK's legal landscape must now incorporate protections autonomously while maintaining international standards.

## Long-term Consequences

### Global Influence
Brexit’s long-term ramifications [will](../w/will.md) unfold over years, if not decades. The UK's ability to influence global policies, [trade](../t/trade.md) standards, and geopolitical strategies is under scrutiny. Its pivot towards Commonwealth nations and rekindling historical ties form part of this broader strategy.

### Economic Adjustments
Long-term economic adjustments involve recalibrating sectors like technology, [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md), and agriculture. Policies must adapt to new realities, focusing on innovation, resilience, and global competitiveness.

### Societal Evolution
On a societal level, Brexit has sparked debates about identity, belonging, and national purpose. These discussions are likely to shape the UK's cultural and political landscape, influencing future generations' perspectives.

## Conclusion

Brexit represents a watershed moment in contemporary history. Its multifaceted nature encompasses legal, economic, social, and political dimensions. The journey that began with a 2016 referendum continues to evolve, shaping the UK's destiny in complex ways. Whether seen as an assertion of independence or a retreat from internationalism, Brexit's legacy [will](../w/will.md) undeniably influence the UK-EU relationship and broader global dynamics for years to come.

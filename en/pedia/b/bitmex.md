# BitMEX

## Introduction
BitMEX, which stands for "Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange," is a cryptocurrency exchange and derivative trading platform established in 2014 by HDR Global Trading, a company founded by financial experts Arthur Hayes, Samuel Reed, and Ben Delo. The platform is known for its advanced trading features, high leverage options, and robust trading engine. It has played a significant role in the evolution of the cryptocurrency market, especially in the derivatives segment.

## Founders and History
BitMEX was launched in 2014 by Arthur Hayes, Samuel Reed, and Ben Delo. Arthur Hayes, a former equities trader at Deutsche Bank and Citibank, envisioned a platform that would cater to professional traders interested in digital assets. Ben Delo, a former software engineer at IBM, and Samuel Reed, a consultant at Ticonderoga, joined him in realizing this vision.

Over the years, BitMEX gained significant traction within the trading community thanks to its user-friendly interface, high liquidity, and advanced features such as leverage trading and perpetual contracts. 

## Platform Features

### Leverage Trading
One of the main attractions of BitMEX is its leverage trading options. The platform offers up to 100x leverage on some contracts. This means traders can control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital, amplifying both potential gains and losses.

### Perpetual Contracts
BitMEX introduced perpetual contracts, a type of futures contract without an expiry date. These contracts closely mimic the spot price and have become highly popular among traders. Funding rates, which are payments made between long and short positions based on the difference between the perpetual contract price and the spot price, help ensure that the contract price closely follows the underlying asset price.

### Advanced Order Types
BitMEX offers a variety of advanced order types, including:

- **Limit Orders**
- **Market Orders**
- **Stop Market Orders**
- **Stop Limit Orders**
- **Trailing Stop Orders**
- **Take Profit Limit Orders**
- **Take Profit Market Orders**

These order types help traders implement complex trading strategies and manage risk more effectively.

### Security Measures
BitMEX employs several security measures to protect user funds and data:

- **Multisignature Wallets:** BitMEX uses multi-signature addresses to store user funds, requiring multiple private keys for any transaction.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Users can enable 2FA to add an extra layer of security to their accounts.
- **Withdrawal Limits and Review:** Withdrawals are processed manually once a day, and large withdrawals are reviewed by multiple staff members.
- **Secure Environment:** BitMEX runs on Amazon Web Services (AWS), ensuring a high level of infrastructure security.

### High-Performance Trading Engine
BitMEX's trading engine is known for its stability and performance, capable of processing up to 100 transactions per second. This is crucial for trading large volumes and executing orders quickly in the highly volatile cryptocurrency market.

## Regulatory Challenges
BitMEX has faced regulatory challenges over the years. In October 2020, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) charged BitMEX and its founders with operating an unregistered trading platform and violating multiple CFTC regulations, including anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements. As a result, the founders stepped down from their executive roles, and BitMEX implemented stricter KYC procedures.

## Algorithmic Trading on BitMEX
Algorithmic trading, or algo trading, involves using computer algorithms to automatically execute trading strategies. BitMEX offers features conducive to algo trading:

- **API Access:** BitMEX provides robust API access, allowing traders to connect their algorithms to the exchange. The REST API and WebSocket API enable users to access market data, place orders, and manage accounts programmatically.

- **Taker Fees:** Traders taking liquidity from the market (taker orders) pay a 0.075% fee.
These fees can vary depending on the contract being traded and market conditions.

## Impact and Criticism
Despite its popularity, BitMEX has faced criticism on several fronts:

- **Regulatory Scrutiny:** As mentioned, BitMEX has faced legal challenges, primarily from U.S. regulators, impacting its reputation.
- **Market Manipulation Claims:** There have been instances where BitMEX was accused of market manipulation. The platform's high leverage and large market position have raised concerns about its potential to influence market prices.
- **Liquidations and System Overloads:** During periods of high volatility, BitMEX has experienced system overloads, leading to trade delays and forced liquidations, causing dissatisfaction among users.

## User Interface and Experience
BitMEXâ€™s user interface caters primarily to professional traders. Key features include:

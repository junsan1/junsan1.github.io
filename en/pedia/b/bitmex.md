# BitMEX

## Introduction
BitMEX, which stands for "[Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) Mercantile [Exchange](../e/exchange.md)," is a cryptocurrency [exchange](../e/exchange.md) and [derivative](../d/derivative.md) [trading platform](../t/trading_platform.md) established in 2014 by HDR Global Trading, a company founded by financial experts Arthur Hayes, Samuel Reed, and Ben Delo. The platform is known for its advanced trading features, high [leverage](../l/leverage.md) [options](../o/options.md), and [robust](../r/robust.md) trading engine. It has played a significant role in the evolution of the cryptocurrency [market](../m/market.md), especially in the [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) segment.

## Founders and History
BitMEX was launched in 2014 by Arthur Hayes, Samuel Reed, and Ben Delo. Arthur Hayes, a former equities [trader](../t/trader.md) at Deutsche [Bank](../b/bank.md) and Citibank, envisioned a platform that would cater to professional traders interested in digital assets. Ben Delo, a former software engineer at IBM, and Samuel Reed, a consultant at Ticonderoga, joined him in realizing this vision.

Over the years, BitMEX gained significant traction within the trading community thanks to its user-friendly interface, high [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), and advanced features such as [leverage](../l/leverage.md) trading and perpetual contracts. 

## Platform Features

### Leverage Trading
One of the main attractions of BitMEX is its [leverage](../l/leverage.md) trading [options](../o/options.md). The platform offers up to 100x [leverage](../l/leverage.md) on some contracts. This means traders can control a large position with a relatively small amount of [capital](../c/capital.md), amplifying both potential gains and losses.

### Perpetual Contracts
BitMEX introduced perpetual contracts, a type of [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) without an expiry date. These contracts closely mimic the [spot price](../s/spot_price.md) and have become highly popular among traders. Funding rates, which are payments made between long and short positions based on the difference between the perpetual contract price and the [spot price](../s/spot_price.md), help ensure that the contract price closely follows the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) price.

### Advanced Order Types
BitMEX offers a variety of advanced [order types](../o/order_types_in_trading.md), including:

- **Limit Orders**
- **[Market](../m/market.md) Orders**
- **Stop [Market](../m/market.md) Orders**
- **Stop Limit Orders**
- **[Trailing Stop](../t/trailing_stop.md) Orders**
- **Take [Profit](../p/profit.md) Limit Orders**
- **Take [Profit](../p/profit.md) [Market](../m/market.md) Orders**

These [order types](../o/order_types_in_trading.md) help traders implement complex [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) and manage [risk](../r/risk.md) more effectively.

### Security Measures
BitMEX employs several [security](../s/security.md) measures to protect user funds and data:

- **Multisignature Wallets:** BitMEX uses multi-signature addresses to store user funds, requiring [multiple](../m/multiple.md) private keys for any [transaction](../t/transaction.md).
- **Two-[Factor](../f/factor.md) Authentication (2FA):** Users can enable 2FA to add an extra layer of [security](../s/security.md) to their accounts.
- **[Withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) Limits and Review:** Withdrawals are processed manually once a day, and large withdrawals are reviewed by [multiple](../m/multiple.md) staff members.
- **Secure Environment:** BitMEX runs on Amazon Web Services (AWS), ensuring a high level of [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) [security](../s/security.md).

### High-Performance Trading Engine
BitMEX's trading engine is known for its stability and performance, capable of processing up to 100 transactions per second. This is crucial for trading large volumes and executing orders quickly in the highly volatile cryptocurrency [market](../m/market.md).

## Regulatory Challenges
BitMEX has faced regulatory challenges over the years. In October 2020, the U.S. [Commodity Futures](../c/commodity_futures.md) Trading [Commission](../c/commission.md) (CFTC) charged BitMEX and its founders with operating an unregistered [trading platform](../t/trading_platform.md) and violating [multiple](../m/multiple.md) CFTC regulations, including anti-[money laundering](../m/money_laundering.md) (AML) and know-your-[customer](../c/customer.md) (KYC) requirements. As a result, the founders stepped down from their executive roles, and BitMEX implemented stricter KYC procedures.

## Algorithmic Trading on BitMEX
[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), or algo trading, involves using computer algorithms to automatically execute [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). BitMEX offers features conducive to algo trading:

- **High [Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md):** BitMEX's high [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) ensures that large orders can be executed with minimal [slippage](../s/slippage.md), a crucial [factor](../f/factor.md) for many [algorithmic trading strategies](../a/algorithmic_trading_strategies.md).

- **Maker Fees:** Traders providing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) to the [market](../m/market.md) (maker orders) earn a 0.025% [rebate](../r/rebate.md).
- **Taker Fees:** Traders taking [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) from the [market](../m/market.md) (taker orders) pay a 0.075% [fee](../f/fee.md).
These fees can vary depending on the contract being traded and [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

- **Liquidations and System Overloads:** During periods of high [volatility](../v/volatility.md), BitMEX has experienced system overloads, leading to [trade](../t/trade.md) delays and forced liquidations, causing dissatisfaction among users.

# Bank Run

A [bank](../b/bank.md) run occurs when a large number of customers of a [bank](../b/bank.md) or other financial institution withdraw their deposits simultaneously over concerns of the [bank](../b/bank.md)'s [solvency](../s/solvency.md). As more people withdraw their [money](../m/money.md), the probability of [default](../d/default.md) increases, prompting more people to withdraw their deposits. This cascade effect can quickly deplete the [bank](../b/bank.md)'s reserves, leading to its collapse. [Bank](../b/bank.md) runs have been a significant [factor](../f/factor.md) in the history of banking, often precipitating larger economic crises.

## Causes of Bank Runs

### 1. Loss of Confidence
The primary cause of a [bank](../b/bank.md) run is usually a loss of confidence among depositors regarding the [bank](../b/bank.md)'s ability to meet its [obligations](../o/obligation.md). This can be triggered by rumors, financial instability, or perceived poor management.

### 2. Economic Downturn
During periods of economic downturn, banks are more vulnerable to runs due to increased [default](../d/default.md) rates on loans and reduced [asset](../a/asset.md) values. Economic recessions can affect businesses and individuals' ability to repay loans, thus affecting the [bank](../b/bank.md)'s [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).

### 3. Political Instability
Political instability or changes in [government policies](../g/government_policies_in_trading.md) can impact a [bank](../b/bank.md)'s operations, leading to depositor [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) and triggering a [bank](../b/bank.md) run. For instance, changes in banking regulations or the [nationalization](../n/nationalization.md) of banks can create panic.

### 4. Insolvency Speculation
[Speculation](../s/speculation.md) about a [bank](../b/bank.md)â€™s [insolvency](../i/insolvency.md) can spread quickly, causing panic among depositors. Even if unfounded, these rumors can create a self-fulfilling prophecy where the concern over potential [insolvency](../i/insolvency.md) causes it to happen.

## Historical Examples

### The Great Depression (1929-1939)
During the [Great Depression](../g/great_depression.md), numerous banks in the United States experienced runs, leading to widespread [bank](../b/bank.md) failures. The [stock market crash](../s/stock_market_crash.md) in 1929 instigated a wave of panic, exacerbated by the lack of depositor [insurance](../i/insurance.md) at the time.

### Northern Rock (2007)
In 2007, the British [bank](../b/bank.md) Northern Rock suffered a [bank](../b/bank.md) run after it sought emergency assistance from the [Bank](../b/bank.md) of England during the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md). News of its troubles led to massive withdrawals, ultimately leading to its [nationalization](../n/nationalization.md).

### The 2008 Financial Crisis
The 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) saw several instances of [bank](../b/bank.md) runs, particularly with institutions heavily involved in the [subprime mortgage](../s/subprime_mortgage.md) [market](../m/market.md). Banks like Washington Mutual faced [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) issues, leading to significant withdrawals and eventual failure.

## Measures to Prevent Bank Runs

### 1. Deposit Insurance
[Deposit](../d/deposit.md) [insurance](../i/insurance.md) is one of the most effective measures to prevent [bank](../b/bank.md) runs. By guaranteeing depositors' funds up to a certain limit, [insurance](../i/insurance.md) schemes (like the FDIC in the United States) can reduce panic and maintain confidence in the banking system.

### 2. Central Bank Support
Central banks can act as lenders of last resort, providing banks with [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) during times of crisis to prevent runs. This backstop can reassure depositors that they [will](../w/will.md) have access to their funds even if a [bank](../b/bank.md) experiences short-term issues.

### 3. Transparency and Communication
Banks that maintain [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and clear communication with their customers are less likely to experience runs. Providing accurate [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) and proactive communication about potential risks can help maintain depositor [trust](../t/trust.md).

### 4. Diversification and Conservative Management
Prudent management of assets and liabilities, along with [diversification](../d/diversification.md) of investments, can enhance a [bank](../b/bank.md)'s resilience against economic shocks, reducing the likelihood of runs.

## Consequences of Bank Runs

[Bank](../b/bank.md) runs can have severe consequences for both the individual [bank](../b/bank.md) and the broader [economy](../e/economy.md). 

### 1. Bank Failure
The immediate consequence of a [bank](../b/bank.md) run is often the failure of the [bank](../b/bank.md). As deposits are withdrawn, the [bank](../b/bank.md)'s [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) reserves are depleted, leading to [insolvency](../i/insolvency.md) if it cannot meet [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) demands.

### 2. Economic Impact
When banks [fail](../f/fail.md), it can lead to a loss of public confidence in financial institutions more broadly, potentially triggering runs on other banks. This can cause a domino effect, leading to widespread financial instability and economic downturns.

### 3. Government Intervention
In extreme cases, [bank](../b/bank.md) runs can necessitate government intervention, such as bailouts or [nationalization](../n/nationalization.md). While such measures can stabilize the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md) temporarily, they often come at significant cost to taxpayers.

### 4. Long-term Trust Issues
Long after the initial crisis, the memory of a [bank](../b/bank.md) run can lead to long-term [trust](../t/trust.md) issues within the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md). It may take years to rebuild public confidence, affecting the [bank](../b/bank.md)'s ability to attract future deposits and investments.

## Modern Day Context

### Cryptocurrency Exchanges
In the digital age, phenomena similar to [bank](../b/bank.md) runs can occur with cryptocurrency exchanges. If users lose confidence in an [exchange](../e/exchange.md)'s [security](../s/security.md) or [solvency](../s/solvency.md), they may rush to withdraw their assets, leading to similar [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) issues as traditional [bank](../b/bank.md) runs.

### Digital Banking and Fintech Solutions
While traditional [bank](../b/bank.md) runs involved physical branches and withdrawals, digital banking adds complexity to the scenario. With online platforms, the speed at which funds can be withdrawn is unprecedented, potentially accelerating the onset and impact of [bank](../b/bank.md) runs.

### Regulation and Risk Management
Modern banking regulations focus intensely on [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) to prevent runs. [Stress testing](../s/stress_testing.md), [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements, and stringent oversight are all aimed at ensuring banks can survive periods of financial instability without succumbing to runs.

### Case Study: SVB Financial Group (2023)
In early 2023, SVB Financial Group experienced significant withdrawals due to rumors about their [venture capital](../v/venture_capital.md) portfolio's stability. Despite attempts to reassure depositors, the run accelerated, leading to severe [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) challenges. This incident highlighted the ongoing relevance of traditional [bank](../b/bank.md) run dynamics in modern financial systems ([SVB Financial Group](https://www.svb.com/)).

## Conclusion

[Bank](../b/bank.md) runs remain a potent threat to financial stability, despite advances in banking regulations and technology. Understanding the causes, consequences, and preventive measures is crucial for ensuring a resilient banking system capable of weathering economic uncertainties. While [deposit](../d/deposit.md) [insurance](../i/insurance.md) and central [bank](../b/bank.md) interventions provide substantial safeguards, maintaining depositor confidence through [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and effective management practices is equally vital.

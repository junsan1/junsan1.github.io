# Beacon Score

The Beacon Score, now typically referred to as a [FICO Score](../f/fico_score.md), is a type of [credit score](../c/credit_score.md) that was developed by the Fair Isaac [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) (FICO) to measure an individual's [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md). This calculated metric is widely utilized by financial institutions such as banks, [credit](../c/credit.md) unions, and [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) lenders to assess the [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) of an applicant. The score ranges from 300 to 850, with higher scores indicating a lower [risk](../r/risk.md) of [default](../d/default.md).

## Components of a Beacon Score

1. **[Payment](../p/payment.md) History (35%)**
   The most significant part of the Beacon Score, [payment](../p/payment.md) history accounts for 35% and provides information about how an individual has paid their bills in the past. This includes details on late or missed payments, collections, foreclosures, and bankruptcies. A positive [payment](../p/payment.md) history has a beneficial impact on the score, while negative history can significantly lower it.

2. **Amounts Owed (30%)**
   This segment evaluates the total amount of [debt](../d/debt.md) an individual holds. It considers outstanding balances on various [credit](../c/credit.md) accounts, including [credit](../c/credit.md) cards, mortgages, and loans. While having [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [credit](../c/credit.md) accounts doesn't inherently lower the score, high balances relative to the total [credit limit](../c/credit_limit.md) can be detrimental. This is often referred to as the [credit](../c/credit.md) utilization ratio.

3. **Length of [Credit](../c/credit.md) History (15%)**
   Length of [credit](../c/credit.md) history examines how long [credit](../c/credit.md) accounts have been [open](../o/open.md), with a longer history being more favorable. This component also looks at the age of the oldest account, the age of the newest account, and the average age of all accounts. A longer [credit](../c/credit.md) history provides more data for better prediction of future [credit](../c/credit.md) behavior.

4. **[Credit](../c/credit.md) Mix (10%)**
   This part assesses the variety of [credit](../c/credit.md) types an individual has managed, such as [revolving credit](../r/revolving_credit.md) accounts ([credit](../c/credit.md) cards) and installment loans (mortgages, car loans). A diverse [range](../r/range.md) of [credit](../c/credit.md) accounts is generally seen as more favorable. However, opening a large number of [credit](../c/credit.md) accounts in a short period may be viewed negatively.

5. **New [Credit](../c/credit.md) (10%)**
   New [credit](../c/credit.md) evaluates the recent [credit](../c/credit.md) activity of an individual. This includes accounts recently opened and the number of recent [credit](../c/credit.md) inquiries. A high [volume](../v/volume.md) of new [credit](../c/credit.md) inquiries can indicate [financial distress](../f/financial_distress.md) and [risk](../r/risk.md), impacting the score adversely in the short-term.

## Importance in Financial Decision-Making

The Beacon Score is critical in various financial decisions:

- **[Loan](../l/loan.md) Approval**: Lenders primarily use the Beacon Score to decide whether to approve or reject [loan](../l/loan.md) applications. A higher score increases the likelihood of approval.
- **[Interest](../i/interest.md) Rates**: Individuals with higher Beacon Scores often receive lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates on borrowing because they represent lower [risk](../r/risk.md).
- **[Credit](../c/credit.md) Limits**: Higher [credit](../c/credit.md) scores can also result in higher [credit](../c/credit.md) limits and more favorable terms.
- **Job Applications**: Some employers, especially those in financial industries, may review [credit](../c/credit.md) scores as part of their hiring process to assess potential employees' financial responsibility.

## Enhancing the Beacon Score

### Timely Payments
Consistently making on-time payments is integral to maintaining and improving the Beacon Score. Setting up automatic payments or reminders can help mitigate the [risk](../r/risk.md) of late or missed payments.

### Reducing Debt
Paying down existing debts helps reduce the [credit](../c/credit.md) utilization ratio, positively impacting the score. This can be achieved through budgeting, [debt consolidation](../d/debt_consolidation.md), or increasing monthly payments.

### Responsible Credit Management
Opening new [credit](../c/credit.md) accounts judiciously and managing existing ones responsibly contributes positively to the [credit](../c/credit.md) mix and length of [credit](../c/credit.md) history sections of the Beacon Score.

### Regular Monitoring
Regularly checking one's [credit report](../c/credit_report.md) allows individuals to identify and rectify any discrepancies or fraudulent activities that could negatively affect the score.

### Avoiding "Hard" Inquiries
Minimizing the number of "hard" [credit](../c/credit.md) inquiries—those initiated when applying for [credit](../c/credit.md) or loans—can help in maintaining a healthier score. Soft inquiries, such as those made by individuals checking their own [credit](../c/credit.md), do not affect the score.

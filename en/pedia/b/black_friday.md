# Black Friday

## Introduction

Black Friday is a term that has become synonymous with excessive [consumerism](../c/consumerism.md), long lines, and massive sales. It is an informal name for the Friday following Thanksgiving Day in the United States, which is traditionally celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. Black Friday marks the beginning of the holiday shopping season and is often characterized by promotional sales and discounts that can result in significant consumer spending.

## Historical Background

The term "Black Friday" originally had a different meaning and was used to describe September 24, 1869, when two [Wall Street](../w/wall_street.md) financiers caused a [market](../m/market.md) crash by attempting to corner the gold [market](../m/market.md). However, the contemporary meaning of Black Friday dates back to the 1960s in Philadelphia. The police used it to describe the heavy and disruptive pedestrian and vehicular traffic that would occur the day after Thanksgiving. Retailers soon adopted the term, and it gradually gained popularity across the United States.

## Economic Impact

One of the most significant roles of Black Friday is its impact on the [economy](../e/economy.md). It is often a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for consumer sentiment and economic health. Here are some key aspects:

### Sales Figures

In recent years, Black Friday has generated billions of dollars in sales. According to Adobe Analytics, shoppers in the U.S. spent $9 billion online during Black Friday in 2020, making it the second-largest online spending day in U.S. history, preceded only by Cyber Monday.

### Stock Market

The consumer spending frenzy can influence stock prices and [market](../m/market.md) trends. Retail [stocks](../s/stock.md) often see increased activity and [volatility](../v/volatility.md) around this period. Investors and analysts look at Black Friday sales as an [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of retail performance for the holiday season.

### Economic Indicators

Black Friday sales are often used as an [economic indicator](../e/economic_indicator.md) to gauge consumer confidence. High spending levels can be a sign of a healthy [economy](../e/economy.md), whereas lower-than-expected sales may signal economic downturns or consumer [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md).

## Retail Strategies

Black Friday is a critical time for retailers to boost their annual sales figures. Retailers employ various strategies to attract customers and maximize their profits:

### Discounts and Promotions

Retailers [offer](../o/offer.md) deep discounts and promotions to entice shoppers. These can [range](../r/range.md) from doorbuster deals to limited-time offers. The idea is to create a sense of urgency and exclusivity, prompting consumers to make quick purchasing decisions.

### Marketing Campaigns

Extensive [marketing](../m/marketing.md) campaigns are launched weeks, sometimes even months, in advance. These campaigns use a mix of online and offline channels, including [social media](../s/social_media.md), email [marketing](../m/marketing.md), television, and print ads. The goal is to build hype and awareness around the sales event.

### Extended Sales Period

Increasingly, retailers are extending the Black Friday sales period. What was once a single day of deals has now expanded into Black Friday Week, and in some cases, the entire month of November. This strategy helps to manage the surge in shopper traffic and reduce logistical challenges.

## Consumer Behavior

Consumer behavior during Black Friday is influenced by a variety of factors:

### Psychological Triggers

Retailers often use psychological triggers to influence buying behavior. [Scarcity](../s/scarcity.md) (limited stock), social proof (high [demand](../d/demand.md)), and urgency (limited-time offers) are common tactics used to drive purchases.

### Online Shopping

The rise of e-[commerce](../c/commerce.md) has significantly changed Black Friday shopping habits. Many consumers now prefer to shop online to avoid crowds and long lines. According to NRF (National Retail Federation), nearly 57% of holiday shoppers in 2020 planned to make a purchase online.

### Mobile Shopping

Mobile shopping has also seen substantial growth. Retailers optimize their websites and apps for mobile devices to provide a seamless shopping experience. According to a report by App Annie, mobile sales accounted for 40% of Black Friday online sales in 2020.

## Global Phenomenon

While Black Friday originated in the United States, it has quickly become a global phenomenon. Many countries now participate in Black Friday sales, adopting similar tactics and [marketing](../m/marketing.md) strategies to attract shoppers.

### United Kingdom

In the UK, Black Friday has grown significantly in popularity since Amazon introduced it in 2010. Retailers such as Tesco, John Lewis, and Curry's PC World have embraced the [trend](../t/trend.md), often seeing a substantial increase in sales.

### Canada

Canada also participates in Black Friday, although it has its own Thanksgiving in October. Canadian retailers use the event to keep sales local and prevent cross-border shopping to the United States.

### Other Countries

Countries including Australia, Brazil, India, and Germany have also adopted Black Friday. While the degree of participation and consumer enthusiasm varies, the influence of American retail practices is evident.

## Ethical Considerations

Despite its economic benefits, Black Friday is not without criticism:

### Environmental Impact

The environmental impact of Black Friday is considerable. Increased production, packaging, and shipping contribute to a higher carbon footprint. The rise in [consumerism](../c/consumerism.md) also leads to more waste, as products are often bought on impulse and discarded soon after.

### Worker Conditions

Black Friday puts considerable stress on retail workers, who often endure long hours and challenging working conditions. The pressure to meet sales targets can result in a high-stress environment, and temporary workers are often brought in to manage the increased [demand](../d/demand.md).

### Consumer Debt

The allure of discounts can lead consumers into [debt](../d/debt.md). Many buyers rely on [credit](../c/credit.md) cards or [finance](../f/finance.md) [options](../o/options.md) to purchase items they may not be able to afford otherwise. This can result in financial strain and [long-term debt](../l/long-term_debt.md).

## Conclusion

Black Friday is a complex and multifaceted event that has both positive and negative implications. It plays a significant role in the retail ecosystem and has a considerable impact on the [economy](../e/economy.md). However, it also raises important ethical questions about consumer behavior, worker conditions, and environmental sustainability. As the event continues to evolve, both retailers and consumers may need to reconsider their approaches to ensure a more balanced and sustainable future.

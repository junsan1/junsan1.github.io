# Buy Stop Order

A Buy [Stop Order](../s/stop_order.md) is a type of [stop order](../s/stop_order.md) that investors use to buy a [security](../s/security.md) when its price rises to a specified level. This type of [order](../o/order.md) is typically used as a strategy to catch an upward [momentum](../m/momentum.md) in a stock or other [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md). When the [market price](../m/market_price.md) reaches the specified stop price, the buy [stop order](../s/stop_order.md) becomes a [market order](../m/market_order.md) to purchase the [security](../s/security.md) at the next available price. This can help traders enter the [market](../m/market.md) on the upswing and avoid missing out on potential gains as a [security](../s/security.md) increases in [value](../v/value.md).

## Mechanics of a Buy Stop Order

To fully understand how a buy [stop order](../s/stop_order.md) functions, it's important to grasp the mechanics behind it:

1. **Stop Price**: This is the predetermined price set by the [investor](../i/investor.md) which triggers the buy [order](../o/order.md). The stop price is always set above the current [market price](../m/market_price.md).
2. **[Execution](../e/execution.md)**: Once the [security](../s/security.md) crosses the stop price, the [order](../o/order.md) is triggered and turns into a [market order](../m/market_order.md). This means it [will](../w/will.md) be executed at the best possible price available at that time.
3. **[Market Order](../m/market_order.md) Conversion**: Upon reaching the stop price, the buy [stop order](../s/stop_order.md) becomes a [market order](../m/market_order.md), and it [will](../w/will.md) be filled at the next available price, which could be higher or lower than the stop price, depending on [market](../m/market.md) conditions and the speed of price fluctuations.

## Benefits of a Buy Stop Order

- **Automatically Entering Trades**: A buy [stop order](../s/stop_order.md) allows investors to automatically enter a [trade](../t/trade.md) without having to actively monitor the [market](../m/market.md). This is particularly useful in volatile markets where price movements can happen quickly.
- **Catching Upward [Momentum](../m/momentum.md)**: By setting a stop price above the current [market price](../m/market_price.md), traders can capture upward trends in the [market](../m/market.md), buying into [momentum](../m/momentum.md) and riding the wave of increasing prices.
- **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Although primarily used for entering trades, buy stop orders also serve as a [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) tool. For example, if an [investor](../i/investor.md) wants to short a stock but wants to limit the [risk](../r/risk.md) of upward movement, they can place a buy [stop order](../s/stop_order.md) above the [short sale](../s/short_sale.md) price to automatically cover their position if the price rises.

## Use Cases

### Scenario 1: Capturing Breakouts

An [investor](../i/investor.md) might use a buy [stop order](../s/stop_order.md) to capture a [breakout](../b/breakout.md) above a resistance level. For example, if a stock is trading at $50 and has a resistance level at $55, the [investor](../i/investor.md) might set a buy [stop order](../s/stop_order.md) at $56. If the stock price breaks through the resistance and reaches $56, the buy [stop order](../s/stop_order.md) is triggered, and the [investor](../i/investor.md) enters the [trade](../t/trade.md), potentially capturing further upward movement.

### Scenario 2: Entering the Market on Positive News

If a company is expected to make a significant announcement that is likely to positively impact its stock price, an [investor](../i/investor.md) might set a buy [stop order](../s/stop_order.md) slightly above the current [market price](../m/market_price.md). This way, if the news breaks and the stock price jumps, the [order](../o/order.md) [will](../w/will.md) be triggered, allowing the [investor](../i/investor.md) to enter the [market](../m/market.md) and benefit from the price increase.

### Scenario 3: Short Position Risk Management

For traders with short positions, buy stop orders can be used to manage [risk](../r/risk.md). Suppose a [trader](../t/trader.md) short sells a stock at $100, anticipating that the price [will](../w/will.md) drop. To protect against potential losses if the price rises, the [trader](../t/trader.md) can set a buy [stop order](../s/stop_order.md) at $105. If the stock price moves against the [trader](../t/trader.md)'s prediction and reaches $105, the buy [stop order](../s/stop_order.md) is triggered, covering the short position and limiting losses.

## Considerations and Risks

While buy stop orders can be a useful tool, they also come with certain risks and considerations:

- **[Market](../m/market.md) [Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: In highly volatile markets, the [execution](../e/execution.md) price of a buy [stop order](../s/stop_order.md) can be significantly different from the stop price. This [slippage](../s/slippage.md) can result in purchasing the [security](../s/security.md) at a much higher price than anticipated.
- **[Gaps](../g/gap.md)**: During periods of [market](../m/market.md) closure (e.g., overnight or over weekends), prices can gap up or down. If the [opening price](../o/opening_price.md) after such a period is significantly higher than the stop price, the buy [stop order](../s/stop_order.md) [will](../w/will.md) execute at the [opening price](../o/opening_price.md), which might be much higher than the anticipated stop price.
- **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)**: For less [liquid](../l/liquid.md) securities, there might not be a sufficient number of [shares](../s/shares.md) available at the stop price, resulting in partial [execution](../e/execution.md) at different prices.

## Alternative Strategies

While buy stop orders are effective for certain strategies, traders might also consider other [order types](../o/order_types_in_trading.md) or combinations to achieve similar goals:

- **Limit Orders**: Unlike a buy [stop order](../s/stop_order.md), a [limit order](../l/limit_order.md) is set to buy a [security](../s/security.md) at a specific price or lower. This provides more control over the entry price but might result in missed opportunities if the [market](../m/market.md) moves quickly.
- **[Stop-Limit Orders](../s/stop-limit_orders.md)**: This [order](../o/order.md) combines the features of a [stop order](../s/stop_order.md) and a [limit order](../l/limit_order.md). When the stop price is reached, the [order](../o/order.md) becomes a [limit order](../l/limit_order.md) instead of a [market order](../m/market_order.md). This can help control the [execution](../e/execution.md) price but might not be filled if the [market](../m/market.md) moves past the limit price.
- **[Trailing Stop](../t/trailing_stop.md) Orders**: These dynamic orders adjust the stop price at a fixed percentage or dollar amount below the [market price](../m/market_price.md). As the price of the [security](../s/security.md) increases, the stop price adjusts upwards, helping to lock in gains while allowing for upward movement.

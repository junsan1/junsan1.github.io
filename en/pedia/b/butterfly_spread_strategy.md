# Butterfly Spread Strategy

A [butterfly spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md) is a sophisticated [options](../o/options.md) [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) aimed at achieving limited [risk](../r/risk.md) and limited [profit](../p/profit.md) potential. The strategy involves using four [options](../o/options.md) contracts with the same [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md) but different strike prices. It is typically designed for [neutral](../n/neutral.md) markets where the [trader](../t/trader.md) expects minimal price movement in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). The primary benefit of butterfly [spreads](../s/spreads.md) is the built-in [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) due to the defined [profit](../p/profit.md) and loss parameters. Below, we delve into various facets of the [butterfly spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md) strategy, including its components, types, examples, advantages, and disadvantages.

## Components of a Butterfly Spread

A [butterfly spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md) can be constructed using either call [options](../o/options.md) or [put options](../p/put_options.md). The setup involves three different strike prices:

1. **Lower Strike (Buy 1 Option)**: This is the lowest [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) among the three and typically involves buying one option contract.
2. **Middle Strike (Sell 2 [Options](../o/options.md))**: This is the middle [strike price](../s/strike_price.md), and the [trader](../t/trader.md) sells two option contracts at this strike.
3. **Upper Strike (Buy 1 Option)**: This is the highest [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) and involves buying one option contract.

The middle [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) is usually at-the-[money](../m/money.md) (ATM), whereas the lower and upper strike prices are equidistant from the middle strike, making it a balanced strategy.

## Types of Butterfly Spreads

### Long Butterfly Spread with Calls

This is the most common type of [butterfly spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md) and is constructed using call [options](../o/options.md). It involves:
- Buying one [call option](../c/call_option.md) with a lower [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) (K1)
- Selling two call [options](../o/options.md) with a middle [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) (K2)
- Buying one [call option](../c/call_option.md) with a higher [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) (K3)

#### Example
Assume Company XYZ stock is trading at $100, and you expect it to remain stable. You can set up a long [butterfly spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md) as follows:
- Buy 1 XYZ 90 Call at $12
- Sell 2 XYZ 100 Calls at $6 each (Total [premium](../p/premium.md) received: $12)
- Buy 1 XYZ 110 Call at $2

Total initial cost ([debit](../d/debit.md)): $12 + $2 - $12 = $2

### Short Butterfly Spread with Calls

In contrast to the long [butterfly spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md), a short [butterfly spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md) is created when the [trader](../t/trader.md) sells one option at the lower strike, buys two [options](../o/options.md) at the middle strike, and sells one option at the upper strike. This setup yields a net [credit](../c/credit.md) and is profitable when the stock price either moves significantly away from the middle [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) or remains highly volatile.

#### Example
Using the same Company XYZ example:
- Sell 1 XYZ 90 Call at $12
- Buy 2 XYZ 100 Calls at $6 each (Total [premium](../p/premium.md) paid: $12)
- Sell 1 XYZ 110 Call at $2

Total initial [credit](../c/credit.md): $12 + $2 - $12 = $2

### Butterfly Spread with Puts

A [butterfly spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md) can also be constructed using [put options](../p/put_options.md). This involves:
- Buying one [put option](../p/put.md) with a lower [strike price](../s/strike_price.md)
- Selling two [put options](../p/put_options.md) with a middle [strike price](../s/strike_price.md)
- Buying one [put option](../p/put.md) with a higher [strike price](../s/strike_price.md)

#### Example
Assume Company XYZ stock is trading at $100:
- Buy 1 XYZ 90 Put at $8
- Sell 2 XYZ 100 Puts at $4 each (Total [premium](../p/premium.md) received: $8)
- Buy 1 XYZ 110 Put at $1

Total initial cost ([debit](../d/debit.md)): $8 + $1 - $8 = $1

### Long Put Butterfly Spread

With the [long put](../l/long_put.md) [butterfly spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md), the [trader](../t/trader.md) aims to [profit](../p/profit.md) from the stock remaining at or around the middle [strike price](../s/strike_price.md), expecting limited movement.

#### Example
Using the same Company XYZ example:
- Buy 1 XYZ 90 Put at $8
- Sell 2 XYZ 100 Puts at $4 each (Total [premium](../p/premium.md) received: $8)
- Buy 1 XYZ 110 Put at $1

Total initial cost: $1

### Short Put Butterfly Spread

This strategy involves selling the lower and higher strike puts while buying the middle strike put, aiming for significant stock price movement.

#### Example
Using the aforementioned XYZ stock:
- Sell 1 XYZ 90 Put at $8
- Buy 2 XYZ 100 Puts at $4 each (Total [premium](../p/premium.md) paid: $8)
- Sell 1 XYZ 110 Put at $1

Total initial [credit](../c/credit.md): $1

## Advantages of Butterfly Spreads

### Limited Risk

The primary appeal of butterfly [spreads](../s/spreads.md) lies in their limited [risk](../r/risk.md) profile. The maximum loss is constrained to the initial net [debit](../d/debit.md) paid (for long [spreads](../s/spreads.md)) or can be partially [offset](../o/offset.md) by the net [credit](../c/credit.md) received (for short [spreads](../s/spreads.md)).

### Defined Profit

Butterfly [spreads](../s/spreads.md) provide a clearly defined [profit](../p/profit.md) potential. The maximum [profit](../p/profit.md) occurs when the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price is at the middle [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) at expiration. This predictability helps traders better manage their strategies.

### Cost-Efficiency

Compared to other multi-[leg](../l/leg.md) strategies, butterfly [spreads](../s/spreads.md) can be relatively cost-efficient, requiring a lower initial outlay of [capital](../c/capital.md) while still [offering](../o/offering.md) compelling [risk](../r/risk.md)-reward profiles.

## Disadvantages of Butterfly Spreads

### Limited Profit Potential

The [profit](../p/profit.md) potential in butterfly [spreads](../s/spreads.md) is capped, specifically targeting a narrow price [range](../r/range.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). Therefore, it may not be suitable for periods of significant price movement or high [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

### Complexity

Butterfly [spreads](../s/spreads.md) involve [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [options](../o/options.md) contracts, making them more complex than single-[leg](../l/leg.md) option strategies. Traders must be adept at managing different strike prices and expiry dates concurrently.

### Low Probability of Maximum Profit

Achieving the maximum [profit](../p/profit.md) requires the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) to close precisely at the middle [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) at expiration—a situation that is relatively uncommon. Hence, while [risk](../r/risk.md) is limited, so is the likelihood of realizing the optimal [payout](../p/payout.md).

## Practical Applications

### Market Neutral Strategy

Butterfly [spreads](../s/spreads.md) are most effective in [neutral](../n/neutral.md) [market](../m/market.md) conditions or when minimal price movement is anticipated. Traders can [leverage](../l/leverage.md) this strategy to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on periods of low [volatility](../v/volatility.md) while maintaining defined [risk](../r/risk.md) parameters.

### Volatility Play

Advanced traders may use butterfly [spreads](../s/spreads.md) as [volatility](../v/volatility.md) plays, particularly when they expect a decline in implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md). By initiating a [butterfly spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md) before the expected decline, traders can lock in favorable premiums and benefit from the subsequent stabilization of [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

### Income Generation

Despite their complexity, butterfly [spreads](../s/spreads.md) can serve as a tool for generating [income](../i/income.md), especially in [options](../o/options.md) trading portfolios. The limited [risk](../r/risk.md) and defined reward mechanism can add a layer of stability and predictability to an otherwise aggressive [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md).

## Conclusion

The [butterfly spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md) strategy offers an intriguing blend of limited [risk](../r/risk.md) and defined reward, making it a popular choice among seasoned [options](../o/options.md) traders. Its structure and variations—long and short [spreads](../s/spreads.md) with calls or puts—provide flexibility to customize it according to [market](../m/market.md) expectations. Despite its complexities and limited [profit](../p/profit.md) [range](../r/range.md), butterfly [spreads](../s/spreads.md) can be a valuable addition to a [trader](../t/trader.md)'s toolkit, particularly in [neutral](../n/neutral.md) or low [volatility](../v/volatility.md) [market](../m/market.md) environments.

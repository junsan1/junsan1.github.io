# Butterfly Spread Strategy

A [butterfly spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md) is a sophisticated options trading strategy aimed at achieving limited risk and limited profit potential. The strategy involves using four options contracts with the same expiration date but different strike prices. It is typically designed for neutral markets where the trader expects minimal price movement in the underlying asset. The primary benefit of butterfly spreads is the built-in [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) due to the defined profit and loss parameters. Below, we delve into various facets of the [butterfly spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md) strategy, including its components, types, examples, advantages, and disadvantages.

## Components of a Butterfly Spread

A [butterfly spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md) can be constructed using either call options or [put options](../p/put_options.md). The setup involves three different strike prices:

1. **Lower Strike (Buy 1 Option)**: This is the lowest strike price among the three and typically involves buying one option contract.
2. **Middle Strike (Sell 2 Options)**: This is the middle strike price, and the trader sells two option contracts at this strike.
3. **Upper Strike (Buy 1 Option)**: This is the highest strike price and involves buying one option contract.

The middle strike price is usually at-the-money (ATM), whereas the lower and upper strike prices are equidistant from the middle strike, making it a balanced strategy.

## Types of Butterfly Spreads

### Long Butterfly Spread with Calls

This is the most common type of [butterfly spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md) and is constructed using call options. It involves:
- Buying one call option with a lower strike price (K1)
- Selling two call options with a middle strike price (K2)
- Buying one call option with a higher strike price (K3)

#### Example
Assume Company XYZ stock is trading at $100, and you expect it to remain stable. You can set up a long [butterfly spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md) as follows:
- Buy 1 XYZ 90 Call at $12
- Sell 2 XYZ 100 Calls at $6 each (Total premium received: $12)
- Buy 1 XYZ 110 Call at $2

Total initial cost (debit): $12 + $2 - $12 = $2

### Short Butterfly Spread with Calls

In contrast to the long [butterfly spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md), a short [butterfly spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md) is created when the trader sells one option at the lower strike, buys two options at the middle strike, and sells one option at the upper strike. This setup yields a net credit and is profitable when the stock price either moves significantly away from the middle strike price or remains highly volatile.

#### Example
Using the same Company XYZ example:
- Sell 1 XYZ 90 Call at $12
- Buy 2 XYZ 100 Calls at $6 each (Total premium paid: $12)
- Sell 1 XYZ 110 Call at $2

Total initial credit: $12 + $2 - $12 = $2

### Butterfly Spread with Puts

A [butterfly spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md) can also be constructed using [put options](../p/put_options.md). This involves:
- Buying one put option with a lower strike price
- Selling two [put options](../p/put_options.md) with a middle strike price
- Buying one put option with a higher strike price

#### Example
Assume Company XYZ stock is trading at $100:
- Buy 1 XYZ 90 Put at $8
- Sell 2 XYZ 100 Puts at $4 each (Total premium received: $8)
- Buy 1 XYZ 110 Put at $1

Total initial cost (debit): $8 + $1 - $8 = $1

### Long Put Butterfly Spread

With the long put [butterfly spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md), the trader aims to profit from the stock remaining at or around the middle strike price, expecting limited movement.

#### Example
Using the same Company XYZ example:
- Buy 1 XYZ 90 Put at $8
- Sell 2 XYZ 100 Puts at $4 each (Total premium received: $8)
- Buy 1 XYZ 110 Put at $1

Total initial cost: $1

### Short Put Butterfly Spread

This strategy involves selling the lower and higher strike puts while buying the middle strike put, aiming for significant stock price movement.

#### Example
Using the aforementioned XYZ stock:
- Sell 1 XYZ 90 Put at $8
- Buy 2 XYZ 100 Puts at $4 each (Total premium paid: $8)
- Sell 1 XYZ 110 Put at $1

Total initial credit: $1

## Advantages of Butterfly Spreads

### Limited Risk

The primary appeal of butterfly spreads lies in their limited risk profile. The maximum loss is constrained to the initial net debit paid (for long spreads) or can be partially offset by the net credit received (for short spreads).

### Defined Profit

Butterfly spreads provide a clearly defined profit potential. The maximum profit occurs when the underlying asset's price is at the middle strike price at expiration. This predictability helps traders better manage their strategies.

### Cost-Efficiency

Compared to other multi-leg strategies, butterfly spreads can be relatively cost-efficient, requiring a lower initial outlay of capital while still offering compelling risk-reward profiles.

## Disadvantages of Butterfly Spreads

### Limited Profit Potential

The profit potential in butterfly spreads is capped, specifically targeting a narrow price range of the underlying asset. Therefore, it may not be suitable for periods of significant price movement or high volatility.

### Complexity

Butterfly spreads involve multiple options contracts, making them more complex than single-leg option strategies. Traders must be adept at managing different strike prices and expiry dates concurrently.

### Low Probability of Maximum Profit

Achieving the maximum profit requires the underlying asset to close precisely at the middle strike price at expiration—a situation that is relatively uncommon. Hence, while risk is limited, so is the likelihood of realizing the optimal payout.

## Practical Applications

### Market Neutral Strategy

Butterfly spreads are most effective in neutral market conditions or when minimal price movement is anticipated. Traders can leverage this strategy to capitalize on periods of low volatility while maintaining defined risk parameters.

### Volatility Play

Advanced traders may use butterfly spreads as volatility plays, particularly when they expect a decline in implied volatility. By initiating a [butterfly spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md) before the expected decline, traders can lock in favorable premiums and benefit from the subsequent stabilization of market conditions.

### Income Generation

Despite their complexity, butterfly spreads can serve as a tool for generating income, especially in options trading portfolios. The limited risk and defined reward mechanism can add a layer of stability and predictability to an otherwise aggressive trading strategy.

## Conclusion

The [butterfly spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md) strategy offers an intriguing blend of limited risk and defined reward, making it a popular choice among seasoned options traders. Its structure and variations—long and short spreads with calls or puts—provide flexibility to customize it according to market expectations. Despite its complexities and limited profit range, butterfly spreads can be a valuable addition to a trader's toolkit, particularly in neutral or low volatility market environments.

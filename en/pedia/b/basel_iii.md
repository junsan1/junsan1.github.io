# Basel III

Basel III is a comprehensive set of reform measures, developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, to strengthen the regulation, supervision, and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) of the banking sector. These measures aim to improve the [financial sector](../f/financial_sector.md)'s ability to deal with economic stress, enhance [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), and promote [transparency](../t/transparency.md). Basel III was introduced in response to the deficiencies in financial regulation revealed by the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) of 2007-2008. It is a global regulatory framework that addresses various aspects of banking stability, including [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements, [leverage ratios](../l/leverage_ratios.md), and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) requirements. 

## Historical Context and Motivation

The [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) of 2007-2008 exposed significant weaknesses in the banking sector's [capital](../c/capital.md) adequacy, [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) positions. In response, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision set about to create a new framework that would prevent such a crisis in the future. Basel III was born out of this initiative and was designed as an update to the previous accords: [Basel I](../b/basel_i.md) and [Basel II](../b/basel_ii.md).

## Main Components of Basel III

### Capital Requirements

Basel III introduces more stringent [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements aimed at ensuring that banks have the financial strength to absorb shocks arising from economic stress. The key aspects include:

- **Minimum Common [Equity](../e/equity.md) Tier 1 (CET1) Ratio**: This has been increased to 4.5% of [risk-weighted assets](../r/risk-weighted_assets.md) (RWA), up from the 2% under [Basel II](../b/basel_ii.md). CET1 is the [capital](../c/capital.md) of the highest quality, primarily composed of common [shares](../s/shares.md) and [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md).
  
- **[Tier 1 Capital Ratio](../t/tier_1_capital_ratio.md)**: The minimum [Tier 1 capital ratio](../t/tier_1_capital_ratio.md), which includes CET1 and additional [Tier 1 capital](../t/tier_1_capital.md) like preferred [shares](../s/shares.md), has been set at 6% of RWA, up from 4% in [Basel II](../b/basel_ii.md).
  
- **Total [Capital](../c/capital.md) Ratio**: The total [capital](../c/capital.md) ratio remains at 8% of RWA, but Basel III increases the quality of the [capital](../c/capital.md) that must be held.

- **[Capital](../c/capital.md) Conservation Buffer**: Banks must [hold](../h/hold.md) an additional 2.5% of RWA in CET1 [capital](../c/capital.md) as a counter-cyclical buffer during periods of [credit](../c/credit.md) growth.

### Leverage Ratio

One of the significant innovations of Basel III is the introduction of the [leverage ratio](../l/leverage_ratio.md), which is designed to avoid the excessive accumulation of [leverage](../l/leverage.md) on [bank](../b/bank.md) balance sheets. The [leverage ratio](../l/leverage_ratio.md) is calculated as:

\[ \text{[Leverage Ratio](../l/leverage_ratio.md)} = \frac{\text{[Tier 1 Capital](../t/tier_1_capital.md)}}{\text{Total Exposure}} \]

The minimum [leverage ratio](../l/leverage_ratio.md) requirement is set at 3%.

### Liquidity Requirements

To address the [risk](../r/risk.md) of [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) shortages, Basel III introduces [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) requirements to ensure that banks can withstand periods of financial stress. The two main measures are:

- **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) [Coverage Ratio](../c/coverage_ratio.md) (LCR)**: This ensures that a [bank](../b/bank.md) has sufficient high-quality [liquid](../l/liquid.md) assets (HQLA) to cover its [net cash](../n/net_cash.md) outflows over a 30-day stress period. The minimum LCR requirement is 100%.

- **Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)**: This aims to promote more stable funding structures over a longer-term horizon (one year), requiring that the available amount of stable funding (ASF) matches or exceeds the required amount of stable funding (RSF). The minimum NSFR requirement is also 100%.

## Implementation Timelines

The Basel III framework has been implemented in [multiple](../m/multiple.md) stages, giving banks and national supervisors time to adapt to the new standards. The initial phase-in period began in 2013, and full implementation was targeted by 2019. However, adjustments and additional requirements have continued to evolve, with some aspects still being finalized and adjusted in subsequent years.

## Global Impact and Challenges

### Impact on Banks

Basel III has had a significant impact on the banking [industry](../i/industry.md) globally. Banks have had to raise substantial amounts of additional [capital](../c/capital.md), often requiring them to [issue](../i/issue.md) new [equity](../e/equity.md), reduce dividends, or retain more [earnings](../e/earnings.md). Many banks also had to overhaul their [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) procedures to comply with the new requirements.

### Regional Differences

Implementation of Basel III varies across regions, with different jurisdictions incorporating the Basel standards into their national regulations in various ways and at different paces. For example, the [European Union](../e/european_union_(eu).md) implemented Basel III through the [Capital](../c/capital.md) Requirements Directive IV (CRD IV) and the [Capital](../c/capital.md) Requirements Regulation (CRR). The United States also modified its regulatory framework to incorporate Basel III standards, although the specifics can differ somewhat from those in other jurisdictions.

### Criticisms and Controversies

Basel III has faced several criticisms and controversies, including:

- **Procyclicality**: Critics argue that the [capital](../c/capital.md) buffers are procyclical and may exacerbate economic downturns by forcing banks to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) or cut back lending during periods of economic stress.
  
- **Complexity**: The framework's complexity and the burden of compliance have been criticized, particularly for smaller banks that might struggle with the administrative [load](../l/load.md).

- **Impact on Lending**: There are concerns that stricter [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements could reduce banks' ability to lend, potentially slowing [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md).

- **Concentration [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: Critics suggest that standardized [risk](../r/risk.md) weights may [fail](../f/fail.md) to account for the true [risk](../r/risk.md), potentially leading to concentration [risk](../r/risk.md) or underestimating [risk](../r/risk.md) in certain areas.

## Future Developments

Basel IV, sometimes unofficially referred to as the "finalization of Basel III," represents ongoing efforts to refine and improve the Basel framework. It includes further adjustments to the [risk](../r/risk.md)-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) [asset](../a/asset.md) calculation methodologies, revisions to the [leverage ratio](../l/leverage_ratio.md) framework, and the introduction of new standards for [operational risk](../o/operational_risk.md).

For more precise information on Basel IV and continuing developments, you can refer to the Basel Committee's official publications and member banks' reports. It is also beneficial to keep an eye on national regulatory bodies, as they often provide detailed guidelines and updates on the implementation of Basel standards within their jurisdictions.

# Bybit

## Introduction

Bybit is a leading cryptocurrency [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) [exchange](../e/exchange.md) that focuses on leveraging [margin trading](../m/margin_trading.md) and [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) products. It is known for providing an array of trading tools suitable for both beginner and professional traders. Founded in March 2018, Bybit has rapidly grown to become one of the foremost platforms in the digital [asset](../a/asset.md) trading sphere, boasting a user base from more than 100 countries. It is registered in the British Virgin Islands and operates under strict regulatory compliance and [security](../s/security.md) protocols to ensure a safe [trading environment](../t/trading_environment.md).

## Features and Offerings

### Trading Pairs and Products

Bybit supports various trading pairs, including BTC/USD, ETH/USD, XRP/USD, [EOS](../e/eos.md)/USD, and more. The platform also enables perpetual contracts and inverse perpetual contracts which allow traders to speculate on the future price of cryptocurrencies without actually owning the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). 

- **Perpetual Contracts:** These are similar to [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md), but they donâ€™t have an expiry date. They are positioned to replicate a [margin](../m/margin.md)-based [spot market](../s/spot_market.md) and are often preferred by traders wanting to [hold](../h/hold.md) long-term positions.

- **Inverse Perpetual Contracts:** These contracts are settled in the base [currency](../c/currency.md), for example, BTCUSD contracts are settled in [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md). This gives traders a dual advantage by gaining exposure to the [value](../v/value.md) of both the stablecoins and the base cryptocurrency.

### Leverage

Bybit offers up to 100x [leverage](../l/leverage.md) on BTC/USD pairs and less for other trading pairs, allowing traders to control large positions with relatively small margins. This high [leverage](../l/leverage.md) can amplify profits but also comes with increased risks.

### Order Types

Bybit features an array of sophisticated [order types](../o/order_types_in_trading.md) designed to fit various [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md):

- **Limit Orders:** Allow users to specify the price at which they are willing to buy or sell an [asset](../a/asset.md).
- **[Market](../m/market.md) Orders:** Execute at the current best available price.
- **Conditional Orders:** These are advanced [order types](../o/order_types_in_trading.md) which only execute when certain conditions specified by the [trader](../t/trader.md) are met.
- **Stop-Loss and Take-[Profit](../p/profit.md) Orders:** Automatically close positions to manage [risk](../r/risk.md) or [lock in profits](../l/lock_in_profits.md).

### Funding and Withdrawals

Bybit supports funding and withdrawals in cryptocurrencies including BTC, ETH, XRP, [EOS](../e/eos.md), and USDT.

- **Funding Rates:** The [exchange](../e/exchange.md) offers a peer-to-peer funding feature wherein long and short position holders [fund](../f/fund.md) each other. This ensures that the contract price converges with the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) price.
  
- **[Withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) Fees and Limits:** Bybit imposes minimal [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) fees, and there are no [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) limits other than those imposed by [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) network constraints.

## Security Measures

[Security](../s/security.md) is of paramount importance on Bybit. The platform employs multi-signature wallets, cold storage, and two-[factor](../f/factor.md) authentication (2FA) to ensure maximum [security](../s/security.md) for user funds and data.

### Cold Storage

Bybit stores 100% of user funds in cold storage (offline) to protect against hacking and unauthorized access.

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Two-[factor](../f/factor.md) authentication (2FA) is a mandatory [security](../s/security.md) feature on Bybit, adding an extra layer of [security](../s/security.md) to user accounts.

### Insurance Fund

Bybit uses an [insurance](../i/insurance.md) [fund](../f/fund.md) to cover losses occurring from unrealized [profit](../p/profit.md) and loss (UPL) of liquidated positions. This mechanism helps ensure that the platform remains solvent even in extreme [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

## User Interface and Experience

Bybit offers both a web-based [trading platform](../t/trading_platform.md) and mobile applications (available on iOS and Android), providing a seamless user experience. The interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, featuring customizable dashboards, trading charts, and indicators provided by [TradingView](../t/tradingview.md).

### API and Integration

Bybit also offers a [robust](../r/robust.md) API, allowing algorithmic traders to build custom trading bots and strategies:

- **REST API:** Suitable for executing trading commands and accessing [market](../m/market.md) data.
- **WebSocket API:** Ideal for real-time data streaming, including [market depth](../m/market_depth.md), [trade](../t/trade.md) [execution](../e/execution.md), and [order book](../o/order_book.md) updates.

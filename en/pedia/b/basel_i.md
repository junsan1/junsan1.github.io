# Basel I

Basel I, officially known as the Basel [Capital](../c/capital.md) Accord, was introduced in 1988 by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) under the auspices of the [Bank](../b/bank.md) for International Settlements (BIS). It represents the first set of international banking regulations, aimed at standardizing [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements and minimizing the risks faced by banks through a more [robust](../r/robust.md) supervisory framework. The primary objective of Basel I was to enhance the [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and stability of the international banking system by ensuring that banks had adequate [capital](../c/capital.md) reserves to cover their risks.

## Overview

The Basel I Accord focused mainly on the [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) faced by banks and mandated them to maintain sufficient [capital](../c/capital.md) reserves to absorb potential losses. This framework categorized a [bank](../b/bank.md)'s assets into [risk](../r/risk.md)-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) categories and required them to maintain a minimum [capital](../c/capital.md) adequacy ratio (CAR) of 8%. The CAR measures a [bank](../b/bank.md)'s [capital](../c/capital.md) in relation to its [risk-weighted assets](../r/risk-weighted_assets.md) and provides an [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of the [bank](../b/bank.md)'s ability to withstand financial stress.

### Key Components of Basel I

1. **[Capital](../c/capital.md) Adequacy Ratio (CAR)**:
    - Basel I established a minimum CAR of 8%. This ratio is calculated by dividing a [bank](../b/bank.md)'s [capital](../c/capital.md) by its [risk-weighted assets](../r/risk-weighted_assets.md) (RWAs).
2. **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Weighting of Assets**:
    - Assets are categorized into different classes based on their [risk](../r/risk.md) profile. Each [asset class](../a/asset_class.md) is assigned a [risk](../r/risk.md) weight, and the total [risk-weighted assets](../r/risk-weighted_assets.md) (RWAs) are calculated by summing the [weighted](../w/weighted.md) values of each [asset class](../a/asset_class.md).
3. **Tier 1 and [Tier 2 Capital](../t/tier_2_capital.md)**:
    - [Capital](../c/capital.md) is divided into two tiers:
        - **[Tier 1 Capital](../t/tier_1_capital.md)**: Core [capital](../c/capital.md), including [equity](../e/equity.md) [capital](../c/capital.md) and disclosed reserves.
        - **[Tier 2 Capital](../t/tier_2_capital.md)**: Supplementary [capital](../c/capital.md), consisting of items such as [undisclosed reserves](../u/undisclosed_reserves.md), [revaluation](../r/revaluation.md) reserves, [subordinated debt](../s/subordinated_debt.md), and hybrid instruments.

## Risk Weight Categories

Basel I assigned different [risk](../r/risk.md) weights to various [asset](../a/asset.md) classes with an emphasis on [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md). The four primary [risk](../r/risk.md) weights used were 0%, 20%, 50%, and 100%, which reflected the perceived riskiness of each [asset](../a/asset.md) type. For example:

- **0% [Risk](../r/risk.md) Weight**: Cash and government securities.
- **20% [Risk](../r/risk.md) Weight**: Interbank loans and highly rated corporate bonds.
- **50% [Risk](../r/risk.md) Weight**: Residential mortgages.
- **100% [Risk](../r/risk.md) Weight**: Commercial loans, [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), and other assets.

## Implementation and Impact

The Basel I Accord was adopted by banking regulators across G10 countries and served as a foundation for banking regulation on a global scale. It fostered a more stringent regulatory environment, helping to build a more resilient banking sector capable of withstanding financial shocks.

### Global Adoption

Countries outside the G10 also began to adopt Basel I principles, ensuring a more homogeneous regulatory environment for multinational banks and facilitating cross-border banking operations. This global acceptance showcased the agreement's effectiveness in setting a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for [capital](../c/capital.md) adequacy.

### Limitations of Basel I

Despite its significant contributions, Basel I had some limitations. It overlooked certain types of risks, such as [market risk](../m/market_risk.md) and [operational risk](../o/operational_risk.md), focusing primarily on [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md). Furthermore, the simplicity of the [risk](../r/risk.md)-weighting approach failed to capture the nuances of different types of [credit](../c/credit.md) exposures and their associated risks.

## Evolution: From Basel I to Basel II and III

Given the limitations observed in the Basel I framework, the BCBS eventually developed more comprehensive accords named [Basel II](../b/basel_ii.md) and [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md).

### Basel II – Enhanced Risk Sensitivity

[Basel II](../b/basel_ii.md), introduced in 2004, aimed to address the deficiencies of Basel I by adding greater [risk](../r/risk.md) sensitivity and more intricate [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements. It introduced three pillars:

1. **Minimum [Capital](../c/capital.md) Requirements**: Enhanced the [risk](../r/risk.md)-weighting framework and expanded it to encompass [operational risk](../o/operational_risk.md).
2. **Supervisory Review Process**: Introduced guidelines for regulators to assess a [bank](../b/bank.md)'s [capital](../c/capital.md) adequacy and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices.
3. **[Market](../m/market.md) Discipline**: Increased [transparency](../t/transparency.md) requirements to bolster [market](../m/market.md) discipline by improving public [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md).

### Basel III – Strengthening Resilience

The 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) exposed further shortcomings in the [Basel II](../b/basel_ii.md) framework, triggering the development of [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md), which was introduced between 2010 and 2011. [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md) aims to strengthen the resilience of the banking sector by:

1. **Enhancing [Capital](../c/capital.md) Quality**: Increasing the quality and quantity of [capital](../c/capital.md) banks must [hold](../h/hold.md).
2. **[Leverage Ratio](../l/leverage_ratio.md)**: Introducing a non-[risk](../r/risk.md)-based [leverage ratio](../l/leverage_ratio.md) to serve as a supplementary measure to the [risk](../r/risk.md)-based CAR.
3. **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) Requirements**: Establishing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) standards such as the [Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) [Coverage Ratio](../c/coverage_ratio.md) (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR).

## Conclusion

Basel I laid the groundwork for international banking regulation by introducing the first standardized framework for [capital](../c/capital.md) adequacy. Its implementation significantly enhanced the stability and resilience of the global banking system. However, the limitations of Basel I led to the evolution of more sophisticated accords like [Basel II](../b/basel_ii.md) and [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md), which responded to changing financial landscapes and the complexities of modern banking.

Basel I remains a seminal document in the history of banking regulation, marking the beginning of a collaborative approach towards global financial stability and prudence, a mission that subsequent accords continue to [uphold](../u/uphold.md) and advance.

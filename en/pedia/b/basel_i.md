# Basel I

Basel I, officially known as the Basel Capital Accord, was introduced in 1988 by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) under the auspices of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). It represents the first set of international banking regulations, aimed at standardizing capital requirements and minimizing the risks faced by banks through a more robust supervisory framework. The primary objective of Basel I was to enhance the efficiency and stability of the international banking system by ensuring that banks had adequate capital reserves to cover their risks.

## Overview

The Basel I Accord focused mainly on the credit risk faced by banks and mandated them to maintain sufficient capital reserves to absorb potential losses. This framework categorized a bank's assets into risk-weighted categories and required them to maintain a minimum capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of 8%. The CAR measures a bank's capital in relation to its risk-weighted assets and provides an indicator of the bank's ability to withstand financial stress.

### Key Components of Basel I

1. **Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR)**:
    - Basel I established a minimum CAR of 8%. This ratio is calculated by dividing a bank's capital by its risk-weighted assets (RWAs).
2. **Risk Weighting of Assets**:
    - Assets are categorized into different classes based on their risk profile. Each asset class is assigned a risk weight, and the total risk-weighted assets (RWAs) are calculated by summing the weighted values of each asset class.
3. **Tier 1 and Tier 2 Capital**:
    - Capital is divided into two tiers:
        - **Tier 1 Capital**: Core capital, including equity capital and disclosed reserves.
        - **Tier 2 Capital**: Supplementary capital, consisting of items such as undisclosed reserves, revaluation reserves, subordinated debt, and hybrid instruments.

## Risk Weight Categories

Basel I assigned different risk weights to various asset classes with an emphasis on credit risk. The four primary risk weights used were 0%, 20%, 50%, and 100%, which reflected the perceived riskiness of each asset type. For example:

- **0% Risk Weight**: Cash and government securities.
- **20% Risk Weight**: Interbank loans and highly rated corporate bonds.
- **50% Risk Weight**: Residential mortgages.
- **100% Risk Weight**: Commercial loans, real estate, and other assets.

## Implementation and Impact

The Basel I Accord was adopted by banking regulators across G10 countries and served as a foundation for banking regulation on a global scale. It fostered a more stringent regulatory environment, helping to build a more resilient banking sector capable of withstanding financial shocks.

### Global Adoption

Countries outside the G10 also began to adopt Basel I principles, ensuring a more homogeneous regulatory environment for multinational banks and facilitating cross-border banking operations. This global acceptance showcased the agreement's effectiveness in setting a benchmark for capital adequacy.

### Limitations of Basel I

Despite its significant contributions, Basel I had some limitations. It overlooked certain types of risks, such as market risk and operational risk, focusing primarily on credit risk. Furthermore, the simplicity of the risk-weighting approach failed to capture the nuances of different types of credit exposures and their associated risks.

## Evolution: From Basel I to Basel II and III

Given the limitations observed in the Basel I framework, the BCBS eventually developed more comprehensive accords named Basel II and Basel III.

### Basel II – Enhanced Risk Sensitivity

Basel II, introduced in 2004, aimed to address the deficiencies of Basel I by adding greater risk sensitivity and more intricate capital requirements. It introduced three pillars:

1. **Minimum Capital Requirements**: Enhanced the risk-weighting framework and expanded it to encompass operational risk.
2. **Supervisory Review Process**: Introduced guidelines for regulators to assess a bank's capital adequacy and risk management practices.
3. **Market Discipline**: Increased transparency requirements to bolster market discipline by improving public disclosure.

### Basel III – Strengthening Resilience

The 2008 financial crisis exposed further shortcomings in the Basel II framework, triggering the development of Basel III, which was introduced between 2010 and 2011. Basel III aims to strengthen the resilience of the banking sector by:

1. **Enhancing Capital Quality**: Increasing the quality and quantity of capital banks must hold.
2. **Leverage Ratio**: Introducing a non-risk-based leverage ratio to serve as a supplementary measure to the risk-based CAR.
3. **Liquidity Requirements**: Establishing liquidity standards such as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR).

## Conclusion

Basel I laid the groundwork for international banking regulation by introducing the first standardized framework for capital adequacy. Its implementation significantly enhanced the stability and resilience of the global banking system. However, the limitations of Basel I led to the evolution of more sophisticated accords like Basel II and Basel III, which responded to changing financial landscapes and the complexities of modern banking.

Basel I remains a seminal document in the history of banking regulation, marking the beginning of a collaborative approach towards global financial stability and prudence, a mission that subsequent accords continue to uphold and advance.

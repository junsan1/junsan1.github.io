# Bull Spread

A Bull Spread, also known as a Bullish Spread, is an options strategy used by traders who anticipate a moderate rise in the price of the underlying asset. This strategy can be implemented with either call options or put options, depending on the trader's preference and market conditions. Bull spreads are popular because they limit both potential profits and losses, making them an attractive choice for conservative investors.

## Types of Bull Spreads

There are primarily two types of bull spreads:

1. **Bull Call Spread**
2. **Bull Put Spread**

### Bull Call Spread
A Bull Call Spread involves buying a call option at a lower strike price while simultaneously selling another call option at a higher strike price. Both options have the same expiration date. This strategy is constructed to profit from a moderate rise in the price of the underlying asset.

**Example:**

Suppose a trader is bullish on a stock that is currently trading at $50. They could implement a bull call spread by:

- Buying a call option with a strike price of $50 for $5 per share (Option A)
- Selling a call option with a strike price of $55 for $2 per share (Option B)

The total cost (or premium) for this spread is $3 per share ($5 - $2).

**Outcome Scenarios:**

1. **Stock price at expiry is below $50:**
   - Both options expire worthless.
   - Loss = Premium paid = $3 per share.

2. **Stock price at expiry is between $50 and $55:**
   - Option A is in the money.
   - Option B is out of the money or at the money.
   - Profit = (Stock price at expiry - $50) - $3.

3. **Stock price at expiry is above $55:**
   - Both options are in the money.
   - Maximum Profit = ($55 - $50) - $3 = $2 per share.

### Bull Put Spread
A Bull Put Spread involves selling a put option at a higher strike price while simultaneously buying another put option at a lower strike price. Both options have the same expiration date. This strategy aims to profit from a moderate rise in the price of the underlying asset while limiting potential losses.

**Example:**

Suppose a trader is bullish on a stock that is currently trading at $50. They could implement a bull put spread by:

- Selling a put option with a strike price of $50 for $5 per share (Option C)
- Buying a put option with a strike price of $45 for $2 per share (Option D)

The total net credit for this spread is $3 per share ($5 - $2).

**Outcome Scenarios:**

1. **Stock price at expiry is below $45:**
   - Both options are in the money.
   - Loss = ($50 - $45) - $3 = $2 per share.

2. **Stock price at expiry is between $45 and $50:**
   - Option C is in the money or at the money.
   - Option D is out of the money.
   - Profit = Net credit received ($3) - (Stock price at expiry - $45).

3. **Stock price at expiry is above $50:**
   - Both options expire worthless.
   - Maximum Profit = Net credit received = $3 per share.

## Advantages of Bull Spread

- **Limited Risk:** Both bull call and bull put spreads have a clearly defined risk, limited to the net premium paid or received.
- **Reduced Cost:** Compared to buying a single call or put option, bull spreads typically involve a lower net premium.

## Disadvantages of Bull Spread

- **Limited Profit Potential:** While the risk is limited, the profit potential is also capped.
- **Requires Moderate Bullish Movement:** Bull spreads are not suitable for very bullish scenarios where the underlying asset is expected to rise significantly.

## When to Use Bull Spread

- **Neutral to Moderately Bullish Outlook:** Ideal when the trader expects a modest rise in the underlying asset's price.
- **Controlled Risk Environment:** Suitable in situations where risk management is crucial.

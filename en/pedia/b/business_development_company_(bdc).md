# Business Development Company (BDC)

## What is a Business Development Company (BDC)?

A [Business](../b/business.md) Development Company (BDC) is a type of closed-end [investment company](../i/investment_company.md) in the United States that is designed to help small- and medium-sized businesses grow during their initial stages of development. BDCs provide [financing](../f/financing.md) to these firms through [equity](../e/equity.md) investments, [debt](../d/debt.md) instruments, or a combination of both. Established under the Small [Business](../b/business.md) Investment Incentive Act of 1980, BDCs were created to facilitate [capital](../c/capital.md) formation for small and mid-sized businesses while providing individual investors an opportunity to participate in [private equity](../p/private_equity.md)-level returns. BDCs are regulated by the [Investment Company Act of 1940](../i/investment_company_act_of_1940.md) and are monitored by the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC).

## Characteristics of BDCs

### 1. Investment Mandate

A primary characteristic of BDCs is their investment mandate. They are required to invest at least 70% of their assets in qualifying assets, typically defined as private or thinly traded public companies with [market](../m/market.md) values below a specified threshold. This mandate ensures that BDCs remain focused on helping small to mid-sized enterprises.

### 2. Leverage Limits

To safeguard against excessive [risk](../r/risk.md), the SEC imposes limits on the amount of [leverage](../l/leverage.md) BDCs can use. BDCs are permitted to borrow [money](../m/money.md), but their [debt](../d/debt.md)-to-[equity](../e/equity.md) ratio cannot exceed 1:1. This means for every dollar of [equity](../e/equity.md), a BDC can borrow a dollar of [debt](../d/debt.md). Recent regulatory changes have allowed BDCs to increase this [leverage](../l/leverage.md) limit to 2:1 under certain conditions, [offering](../o/offering.md) more flexibility for [fund](../f/fund.md) managers.

### 3. Distribution Requirements

BDCs are required to distribute at least 90% of their [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md) to shareholders in the form of dividends. This requirement is similar to [Real Estate](../r/real_estate.md) Investment Trusts (REITs) and ensures regular [income](../i/income.md) for investors, albeit at the cost of retaining [earnings](../e/earnings.md) for growth.

### 4. Diversification Rules

To avoid undue concentration of [risk](../r/risk.md), BDCs must comply with [diversification](../d/diversification.md) requirements. They are restricted from [investing](../i/investing.md) more than 5% of their assets in any one company or owning more than 25% of the company's voting securities.

### 5. Management and Fee Structures

BDCs can be internally or externally managed. Internal management implies that the company's employees undertake all operational and investment decisions. Alternatively, external management means that a third-party advisor manages the BDC, often for an annual [fee](../f/fee.md) based on assets under management and performance incentives.

## Types of BDCs

Two main types of BDCs exist: Publicly traded BDCs and Non-traded BDCs.

### Publicly Traded BDCs

Publicly traded BDCs are [listed](../l/listed.md) on major stock exchanges and can be bought and sold through your [brokerage account](../b/brokerage_account.md) like any other stock. They provide [transparency](../t/transparency.md), [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), and ease of access, making them an attractive investment choice for retail investors. Examples include Ares [Capital](../c/capital.md) [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) (https://www.arescapitalcorp.com/) and [Main Street](../m/main_street.md) [Capital](../c/capital.md) [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) (https://www.mainstcapital.com/).

### Non-traded BDCs

Non-traded BDCs are not [listed](../l/listed.md) on stock exchanges and are instead sold through brokers or financial advisors. While these BDCs can [offer](../o/offer.md) potentially higher returns due to lower [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and attractive initial pricing, they come with less [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md). Investors may have to wait for extended periods or face penalties to redeem their [shares](../s/shares.md). Non-traded BDCs typically feature higher fees due to the lack of competition and sales commissions paid to brokers.

## How to Invest in BDCs

[Investing](../i/investing.md) in BDCs can be an appealing way to [gain](../g/gain.md) exposure to the small and medium [business](../b/business.md) segment, typically inaccessible to retail investors through other channels. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

### 1. Determine Your Investment Goals

Before [investing](../i/investing.md) in BDCs, clearly outline your investment objectives. Are you looking for high-[yield](../y/yield.md) [income](../i/income.md), [capital](../c/capital.md) appreciation, or a mix of both? Understanding your goals [will](../w/will.md) help you choose between publicly traded and non-traded BDCs.

### 2. Research BDCs

[Investing](../i/investing.md) in any [asset class](../a/asset_class.md) requires thorough research. Look for BDCs with a history of consistent performance, a diverse portfolio of investments, strong management teams, and transparent financials. Pay special attention to the [fee](../f/fee.md) structures, as high fees can erode your returns.

### 3. Consider the Risks

BDCs come with inherent risks, such as [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md), [valuation](../v/valuation.md) [risk](../r/risk.md), [leverage](../l/leverage.md) [risk](../r/risk.md), and [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md). Be aware that the companies BDCs invest in are often at early growth stages and may have higher rates of [default](../d/default.md). Additionally, BDC performance is sensitive to [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) changes, which can affect borrowing costs and [dividend](../d/dividend.md) yields.

### 4. Choose Between Publicly Traded and Non-traded BDCs

Decide whether you prefer the [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and [transparency](../t/transparency.md) of publicly traded BDCs or potentially higher returns of non-traded BDCs with limited [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md). Your decision should align with your overall [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) and [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md).

### 5. Diversify Your Portfolio

While BDCs can be an excellent addition to an investment portfolio, they should not constitute its entirety. [Diversification](../d/diversification.md) across different [asset](../a/asset.md) classes, industries, and geographies is the key to mitigating [risk](../r/risk.md) and enhancing returns.

### 6. Execute the Investment

For publicly traded BDCs, purchase [shares](../s/shares.md) through any [brokerage account](../b/brokerage_account.md), just like you would with any other stock. For non-traded BDCs, consult with a [financial advisor](../f/financial_advisor.md) or [broker](../b/broker.md) who can facilitate the investment and guide you through the process.

### 7. Monitor Your Investment

Regularly track the performance of your BDC investments. Keep an eye on the company's financial reports, portfolio composition, [distribution](../d/distribution.md) history, and overall [market](../m/market.md) conditions. Adjust your portfolio as needed based on changing [market](../m/market.md) circumstances and financial goals.

## Advantages of Investing in BDCs

### 1. High Dividend Yields

Due to their [distribution](../d/distribution.md) requirements, BDCs often [offer](../o/offer.md) attractive [dividend](../d/dividend.md) yields, making them an appealing choice for [income](../i/income.md)-focused investors.

### 2. Access to Private Equity Returns

BDCs provide retail investors with access to [private equity](../p/private_equity.md)-like investments, including early-stage companies poised for growth, which are typically reserved for institutional investors.

### 3. Diversification

By [investing](../i/investing.md) in a [range](../r/range.md) of small and medium-sized businesses across different industries, BDCs [offer](../o/offer.md) [diversification benefits](../d/diversification_benefits.md), reducing the overall portfolio [risk](../r/risk.md).

### 4. Professional Management

Both internally and externally managed BDCs benefit from professional [fund](../f/fund.md) managers with expertise in identifying, nurturing, and exiting growth investments.

## Disadvantages of Investing in BDCs

### 1. High Risk

Investments in early-stage and smaller companies come with high [default](../d/default.md) risks. BDCs may face considerable losses if their portfolio companies [fail](../f/fail.md) to perform as expected.

### 2. Fee Structure

BDCs, especially non-traded ones, can come with high fees, including management fees, performance fees, and sales commissions. These fees can significantly impact the overall returns.

### 3. Interest Rate Sensitivity

BDCs typically use [leverage](../l/leverage.md) to enhance returns, making them sensitive to [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) changes. Rising [interest](../i/interest.md) rates can increase borrowing costs and reduce profitability.

### 4. Limited Liquidity

Non-traded BDCs [offer](../o/offer.md) limited [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), imposing lock-up periods and penalties for early [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md), which can be a drawback for investors seeking flexibility.

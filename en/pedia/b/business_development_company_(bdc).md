# Business Development Company (BDC): Definition and How to Invest

## What is a Business Development Company (BDC)?

A Business Development Company (BDC) is a type of closed-end investment company in the United States that is designed to help small- and medium-sized businesses grow during their initial stages of development. BDCs provide financing to these firms through equity investments, debt instruments, or a combination of both. Established under the Small Business Investment Incentive Act of 1980, BDCs were created to facilitate capital formation for small and mid-sized businesses while providing individual investors an opportunity to participate in private equity-level returns. BDCs are regulated by the Investment Company Act of 1940 and are monitored by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

## Characteristics of BDCs

### 1. Investment Mandate

A primary characteristic of BDCs is their investment mandate. They are required to invest at least 70% of their assets in qualifying assets, typically defined as private or thinly traded public companies with market values below a specified threshold. This mandate ensures that BDCs remain focused on helping small to mid-sized enterprises.

### 2. Leverage Limits

To safeguard against excessive risk, the SEC imposes limits on the amount of leverage BDCs can use. BDCs are permitted to borrow money, but their debt-to-equity ratio cannot exceed 1:1. This means for every dollar of equity, a BDC can borrow a dollar of debt. Recent regulatory changes have allowed BDCs to increase this leverage limit to 2:1 under certain conditions, offering more flexibility for fund managers.

### 3. Distribution Requirements

BDCs are required to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends. This requirement is similar to Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and ensures regular income for investors, albeit at the cost of retaining earnings for growth.

### 4. Diversification Rules

To avoid undue concentration of risk, BDCs must comply with diversification requirements. They are restricted from investing more than 5% of their assets in any one company or owning more than 25% of the company's voting securities.

### 5. Management and Fee Structures

BDCs can be internally or externally managed. Internal management implies that the company's employees undertake all operational and investment decisions. Alternatively, external management means that a third-party advisor manages the BDC, often for an annual fee based on assets under management and performance incentives.

## Types of BDCs

Two main types of BDCs exist: Publicly traded BDCs and Non-traded BDCs.

### Publicly Traded BDCs

Publicly traded BDCs are listed on major stock exchanges and can be bought and sold through your brokerage account like any other stock. They provide transparency, liquidity, and ease of access, making them an attractive investment choice for retail investors. Examples include Ares Capital Corporation (https://www.arescapitalcorp.com/) and Main Street Capital Corporation (https://www.mainstcapital.com/).

### Non-traded BDCs

Non-traded BDCs are not listed on stock exchanges and are instead sold through brokers or financial advisors. While these BDCs can offer potentially higher returns due to lower market volatility and attractive initial pricing, they come with less liquidity. Investors may have to wait for extended periods or face penalties to redeem their shares. Non-traded BDCs typically feature higher fees due to the lack of competition and sales commissions paid to brokers.

## How to Invest in BDCs

Investing in BDCs can be an appealing way to gain exposure to the small and medium business segment, typically inaccessible to retail investors through other channels. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

### 1. Determine Your Investment Goals

Before investing in BDCs, clearly outline your investment objectives. Are you looking for high-yield income, capital appreciation, or a mix of both? Understanding your goals will help you choose between publicly traded and non-traded BDCs.

### 2. Research BDCs

Investing in any asset class requires thorough research. Look for BDCs with a history of consistent performance, a diverse portfolio of investments, strong management teams, and transparent financials. Pay special attention to the fee structures, as high fees can erode your returns.

### 3. Consider the Risks

BDCs come with inherent risks, such as credit risk, valuation risk, leverage risk, and interest rate risk. Be aware that the companies BDCs invest in are often at early growth stages and may have higher rates of default. Additionally, BDC performance is sensitive to interest rate changes, which can affect borrowing costs and dividend yields.

### 4. Choose Between Publicly Traded and Non-traded BDCs

Decide whether you prefer the liquidity and transparency of publicly traded BDCs or potentially higher returns of non-traded BDCs with limited liquidity. Your decision should align with your overall investment strategy and risk tolerance.

### 5. Diversify Your Portfolio

While BDCs can be an excellent addition to an investment portfolio, they should not constitute its entirety. Diversification across different asset classes, industries, and geographies is the key to mitigating risk and enhancing returns.

### 6. Execute the Investment

For publicly traded BDCs, purchase shares through any brokerage account, just like you would with any other stock. For non-traded BDCs, consult with a financial advisor or broker who can facilitate the investment and guide you through the process.

### 7. Monitor Your Investment

Regularly track the performance of your BDC investments. Keep an eye on the company's financial reports, portfolio composition, distribution history, and overall market conditions. Adjust your portfolio as needed based on changing market circumstances and financial goals.

## Advantages of Investing in BDCs

### 1. High Dividend Yields

Due to their distribution requirements, BDCs often offer attractive dividend yields, making them an appealing choice for income-focused investors.

### 2. Access to Private Equity Returns

BDCs provide retail investors with access to private equity-like investments, including early-stage companies poised for growth, which are typically reserved for institutional investors.

### 3. Diversification

By investing in a range of small and medium-sized businesses across different industries, BDCs offer diversification benefits, reducing the overall portfolio risk.

### 4. Professional Management

Both internally and externally managed BDCs benefit from professional fund managers with expertise in identifying, nurturing, and exiting growth investments.

## Disadvantages of Investing in BDCs

### 1. High Risk

Investments in early-stage and smaller companies come with high default risks. BDCs may face considerable losses if their portfolio companies fail to perform as expected.

### 2. Fee Structure

BDCs, especially non-traded ones, can come with high fees, including management fees, performance fees, and sales commissions. These fees can significantly impact the overall returns.

### 3. Interest Rate Sensitivity

BDCs typically use leverage to enhance returns, making them sensitive to interest rate changes. Rising interest rates can increase borrowing costs and reduce profitability.

### 4. Limited Liquidity

Non-traded BDCs offer limited liquidity, imposing lock-up periods and penalties for early withdrawal, which can be a drawback for investors seeking flexibility.

# Bird In Hand

The phrase "Bird in Hand" refers to the financial investment theory known as the "Bird-in-Hand Theory" or [dividend](../d/dividend.md) relevance theory, which was put forth by Myron J. Gordon and John Lintner in the 1960s. This theory posits that investors prefer dividends (the "bird in hand") over potential future [capital](../c/capital.md) gains because dividends are perceived as less risky compared to the uncertainties associated with future stock price increases.

## Historical Context
Developed as an alternative to the Modigliani-Miller theorem, which argued that in a perfect [market](../m/market.md) the company's [dividend policy](../d/dividend_policy.md) is irrelevant to its [valuation](../v/valuation.md), the Bird-in-Hand Theory challenges this idea by incorporating [investor](../i/investor.md) behavior into the equation. It emphasizes the assumptions that markets are not perfect and that investors are [risk-averse](../r/risk-averse.md).

## Core Concepts

### Risk Aversion
A fundamental assumption of the Bird-in-Hand Theory is that investors are [risk-averse](../r/risk-averse.md). This means they prefer certain returns over uncertain ones. Even if the potential returns from future [capital](../c/capital.md) gains could be higher, the [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) and [risk](../r/risk.md) attached to them make dividends more attractive.

### Dividend Relevance
According to Gordon and Lintner, dividends are relevant to a company's [market value](../m/market_value.md). Companies paying higher dividends are perceived to be less risky, which leads to higher [valuation](../v/valuation.md) by the [market](../m/market.md). They argue that a dollar of dividends is worth more than a dollar of expected future [capital](../c/capital.md) gains because the former is certain while the latter is not.

### Cost of Equity
The Bird-in-Hand Theory posits that the [cost of equity](../c/cost_of_equity.md) decreases as [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payouts increase. This is because investors [demand](../d/demand.md) a lower [return](../r/return.md) for reduced [risk](../r/risk.md). Companies that pay higher and consistent dividends tend to have a lower [cost of equity](../c/cost_of_equity.md) because they are perceived to be committing to less risky financial practices.

## Mathematical Formulation

Gordon's model, also known as the [Gordon Growth Model](../g/gordon_growth_model.md) (GGM), encapsulates the [valuation](../v/valuation.md) of a stock with a constant growth [dividend](../d/dividend.md). The equation is:

\[ P_0 = \frac{D_1}{r - g} \]

- \( P_0 \): Current stock price
- \( D_1 \): [Dividend](../d/dividend.md) in the next period
- \( r \): Required [rate of return](../r/rate_of_return.md)
- \( g \): Growth rate of dividends

In this model, an increase in dividends \( D_1 \) leads to an increase in the current stock price \( P_0 \).

## Bird-in-Hand Fallacy
Critics often refer to the Bird-in-Hand Theory as the "Bird-in-Hand Fallacy." They argue that the theory overlooks the fact that even if dividends are paid out, the company's overall [value](../v/value.md) should theoretically remain [unchanged](../u/unchanged.md). This critique draws on Miller and Modigliani's [Dividend Irrelevance Theory](../d/dividend_irrelevance_theory.md) which states that, in perfect markets, [dividend policy](../d/dividend_policy.md) has no effect on a companyâ€™s [valuation](../v/valuation.md).

## Empirical Evidence
Empirical studies [offer](../o/offer.md) mixed support for the Bird-in-Hand Theory. While some research shows that companies paying higher dividends tend to be valued higher due to perceived lower [risk](../r/risk.md), other studies suggest that in modern, more efficient markets with varying investment strategies, the preference for dividends is less pronounced.

### Supporting Studies
Several studies support the notion of [dividend](../d/dividend.md) relevance. For instance, Fama and French (2001) noted that firms with higher [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payouts tend to have lower future [risk](../r/risk.md), aligning with the assumptions of the Bird-in-Hand Theory.

### Contradictory Studies
Conversely, researchers like Black and Scholes (1974) have demonstrated that there is little to no [correlation](../c/correlation.md) between high [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payouts and stock prices in efficient markets, challenging the Bird-in-Hand Theory's relevancy.

## Practical Implications

### Investor Behavior
Understanding the Bird-in-Hand Theory can be crucial for portfolio managers and investors who prioritize steady [income](../i/income.md) over high but uncertain returns. It can influence [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) strategies where [dividend](../d/dividend.md)-paying [stocks](../s/stock.md) are preferred for constructing lower-[risk](../r/risk.md) portfolios.

### Corporate Dividend Policies
For corporate financial managers, the Bird-in-Hand Theory emphasizes the importance of a stable and predictable [dividend policy](../d/dividend_policy.md) to attract [risk-averse](../r/risk-averse.md) investors. Businesses that maintain or increase their [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payouts might benefit from a lower [cost of equity](../c/cost_of_equity.md).

### Market Segmentation
The theory can also be instrumental in [market segmentation](../m/market_segmentation.md), where different groups of investors with varying [risk](../r/risk.md) appetites are targeted differently. Companies can tailor their financial communications to appeal specifically to [dividend](../d/dividend.md)-seeking investors.

## Conclusion
The Bird-in-Hand Theory presents an alternative view to traditional [finance](../f/finance.md) theories by focusing on [investor](../i/investor.md) [risk](../r/risk.md) preferences and the certainty attached to [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payments. While it faces criticism and offers mixed empirical support, its principles continue to influence investment strategies and corporate financial policies. Understanding this theory provides valuable insights into [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md) and [investor](../i/investor.md) behavior.

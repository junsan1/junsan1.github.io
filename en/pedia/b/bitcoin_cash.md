# Bitcoin Cash

## Introduction

[Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) Cash (BCH) is a cryptocurrency that was created as a result of a hard fork from [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) (BTC) in August 2017. The primary motivation for this split was to address [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md)'s [scalability](../s/scalability.md) issues and high [transaction fees](../t/transaction_fees.md). [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) Cash aims to provide faster [transaction](../t/transaction.md) times and lower fees by increasing the block size limit, enabling it to [handle](../h/handle.md) more transactions per second compared to [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md).

## Genesis of Bitcoin Cash

The [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) network was experiencing significant congestion, leading to longer [transaction](../t/transaction.md) times and higher fees. This [issue](../i/issue.md) was attributed to the 1 MB block size limit of [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md), as the growing number of transactions could not be processed efficiently. Developers and the community were divided on how to resolve these issues. Some proposed solutions like Segregated Witness (SegWit) to increase [transaction](../t/transaction.md) capacity without changing the block size, while others believed that increasing the block size limit was the right approach. This division led to the creation of [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) Cash on August 1, 2017.

## Technical Differences Between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash

1. **Block Size:**
   - [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md): Initially had a 1 MB block size limit, later increased to 2 MB via the SegWit2x proposal.
   - [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) Cash: Increased the block size limit to 8 MB initially, then further to 32 MB, allowing a higher number of transactions to be processed per block.

2. **[Transaction](../t/transaction.md) Speed and Fees:**
   - By increasing the block size, [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) Cash can process more transactions in each block, leading to faster [transaction](../t/transaction.md) times and lower fees compared to [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md), especially during periods of heavy network congestion.

3. **[Transaction](../t/transaction.md) Signatures:**
   - [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) Cash uses a different signature hashing algorithm (SigHash), which aims to improve replay protection and enhance [security](../s/security.md) against certain types of attacks.

4. **Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm:**
   - [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) Cash employs a different difficulty adjustment mechanism known as the Emergency Difficulty Adjustment (EDA), which adjusts [mining](../m/mining.md) difficulty more frequently to ensure blocks are mined at a consistent rate.

## Adoption and Use Cases

Several merchants, platforms, and services have adopted [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) Cash as a [payment](../p/payment.md) method due to its faster transactions and lower fees. Some notable adopters include:

1. **BitPay:**
   - A global [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) and [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) Cash [payment](../p/payment.md) service provider that allows businesses to accept cryptocurrency payments. [BitPay](https://bitpay.com/)

2. **Purse.io:**
   - A platform that enables users to purchase goods from Amazon using [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) Cash, often at discounted rates. [Purse.io](https://purse.io/)

3. **[Coinbase](../c/coinbase.md):**
   - A popular cryptocurrency [exchange](../e/exchange.md) that supports the buying, selling, and trading of [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) Cash. [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/)

4. **[Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md).com:**
   - A comprehensive source for [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) Cash news, wallets, [exchange](../e/exchange.md) services, and more. [Bitcoin.com](https://www.bitcoin.com/)

## Criticisms and Challenges

Despite its advantages, [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) Cash has faced several criticisms and challenges:

1. **Centralization Concerns:**
   - Critics argue that increasing the block size can lead to greater centralization, as larger blocks require more storage and processing power, potentially limiting participation to those with significant resources.

2. **Network Splits:**
   - [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) Cash itself has undergone additional splits, most notably the creation of [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) SV (Satoshi Vision) led by Craig Wright, further fragmenting the community and diluting resources.

3. **Adoption Rate:**
   - While [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) Cash aims to be a more efficient version of [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md), its adoption rate and [market](../m/market.md) [valuation](../v/valuation.md) are still significantly lower than that of [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md).

## Future Prospects

The future of [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) Cash depends on its ability to sustain growth, improve technology, and [gain](../g/gain.md) wider adoption. Key areas of focus include:

1. **Development Roadmap:**
   - Continuous improvements to the [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) Cash protocol, [scalability](../s/scalability.md) solutions, and implementation of new features [will](../w/will.md) be essential for its future success.

2. **Merchant Adoption:**
   - Expanding its use as a [payment](../p/payment.md) method by partnering with more merchants, platforms, and services.

3. **Community Support:**
   - Fostering a strong and united community that supports the development and use of [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) Cash while addressing centralization concerns and other challenges.

## Conclusion

[Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) Cash represents an important evolution in the cryptocurrency landscape, addressing some of the limitations of [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) with a focus on [scalability](../s/scalability.md) and usability. While it faces significant challenges, its potential for faster transactions and lower fees makes it a viable option for users and merchants alike. The continued development, community support, and real-world adoption [will](../w/will.md) play a crucial role in determining its long-term success.

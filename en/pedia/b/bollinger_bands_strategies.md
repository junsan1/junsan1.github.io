# Bollinger Bands Strategies

[Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md) are a popular [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) tool developed by John Bollinger in the early 1980s. The tool is used to measure [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and identify potential [overbought](../o/overbought.md) or [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions in various [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). [Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md) consist of three lines: a middle band, an upper band, and a lower band. The middle band is a simple moving average (SMA), usually set to 20 periods, while the upper and lower bands are standard deviations, typically set to two standard deviations above and below the middle band, respectively.

The primary insight behind [Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md) is that prices tend to stay within the upper and lower bands around 95% of the time, assuming a [normal distribution](../n/normal_distribution_in_trading.md) of price movements. Therefore, when prices break out of these bands, it can indicate either [overbought](../o/overbought.md) or [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions, signaling potential trading opportunities. Several strategies use [Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md) to inform trading decisions, and in this article, we [will](../w/will.md) delve into some of the most commonly used [Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md) strategies.

## 1. Bollinger Band Squeeze

### Overview

The Bollinger Band Squeeze strategy is designed to identify periods of low [volatility](../v/volatility.md), which are often followed by periods of high [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and potential price breakouts. When the [Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md) come close together, this is referred to as a "squeeze." A squeeze implies that the [market](../m/market.md) is consolidating and a [breakout](../b/breakout.md) is imminent.

### How to Implement

1. **Identify a Squeeze**: Look for a period where the upper and lower [Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md) are converging or are closer together than usual.
2. **Wait for a [Breakout](../b/breakout.md)**: Monitor the stock to identify a [breakout](../b/breakout.md). Breakouts occur when the price moves significantly above the upper band or below the lower band.
3. **Confirm the Direction**: Use additional indicators (such as [volume](../v/volume.md), [Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index.md) (RSI), or Moving Average Convergence [Divergence](../d/divergence.md) (MACD)) to confirm the [breakout](../b/breakout.md) direction.
4. **Enter the [Trade](../t/trade.md)**: Once confirmed, enter a long position if the [breakout](../b/breakout.md) is upward or a short position if the [breakout](../b/breakout.md) is downward.
5. **Set Stop-Loss**: Set a [stop-loss order](../s/stop-loss_order.md) to minimize [risk](../r/risk.md). The stop-loss level can be placed at the middle Bollinger Band or just inside the opposite band.

## 2. Bollinger Band Bounce

### Overview

The Bollinger Band Bounce strategy leverages the concept that price tends to revert to the mean, or the middle band (SMA). This strategy works well in ranging markets where prices oscillate between the upper and lower [Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md).

### How to Implement

1. **Identify Ranging [Market](../m/market.md)**: Confirm that the [market](../m/market.md) is trading sideways, with clear [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels.
2. **Price Touches Bands**: Look for instances where the price touches or slightly breaches the upper or lower bands.
3. **Enter a Countertrend [Trade](../t/trade.md)**: Enter a short position if the price touches the upper band, or a long position if the price touches the lower band.
4. **Set a Target**: The target for the [trade](../t/trade.md) can be the middle band. If the price exceeds or touches the middle band, consider closing the position.
5. **Set Stop-Loss**: Place a [stop-loss order](../s/stop-loss_order.md) just outside the band opposite to the one touched.

## 3. Double Bottoms and Tops

### Overview

The Double Bottoms and Tops strategy utilizes [Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md) to identify potential [reversal patterns](../r/reversal_patterns.md). A [double bottom](../d/double_bottom.md) occurs when the price makes two distinct lows at approximately the same level, separated by a peak. Conversely, a [double top](../d/double_top.md) occurs when the price makes two distinct highs at approximately the same level, separated by a [trough](../t/trough.md).

### How to Implement

1. **Identify the Pattern**: Identify potential double bottoms or double tops. The first bottom should touch or breach the lower band, while the second should be within the bands.
2. **Confirm the Pattern**: Use other indicators like RSI or MACD to confirm the [double bottom](../d/double_bottom.md) or [double top](../d/double_top.md).
3. **Enter the [Trade](../t/trade.md)**: For a [double bottom](../d/double_bottom.md), enter a long position upon confirming the second bottom. For a [double top](../d/double_top.md), enter a short position after confirming the second top.
4. **Set the Target**: The target can be set based on the height of the pattern, extended above or below the [breakout](../b/breakout.md) point.
5. **Set Stop-Loss**: Place a [stop-loss order](../s/stop-loss_order.md) slightly below the first bottom or above the first top.

## 4. Trend Trading with Bollinger Bands

### Overview

The [Trend](../t/trend.md) [Trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) with [Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md) aims to [trade](../t/trade.md) in the direction of the prevailing [trend](../t/trend.md). The idea is to use the [Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md) as dynamic [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels to enter trades.

### How to Implement

1. **Identify the [Trend](../t/trend.md)**: Use additional tools like moving averages to identify the dominant [trend](../t/trend.md).
2. **[Pullback](../p/pullback.md) to Middle Band**: Wait for a [pullback](../p/pullback.md) to the middle band. In an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md), this can be an opportunity to enter a long position; in a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md), look for a [pullback](../p/pullback.md) to short.
3. **Confirm the Move**: Use other indicators, such as [volume](../v/volume.md) or MACD, to confirm the continuation of the [trend](../t/trend.md).
4. **Enter the [Trade](../t/trade.md)**: Enter the [trade](../t/trade.md) in the direction of the [trend](../t/trend.md) when confirmed.
5. **Set Stop-Loss**: Place a [stop-loss order](../s/stop-loss_order.md) just below the middle band in an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md) or above the middle band in a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md).

## 5. Bollinger Bands and RSI

### Overview

Combining [Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md) with the [Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index.md) (RSI) can provide more reliable signals. The RSI measures the speed and change of price movements and is often used to identify [overbought](../o/overbought.md) or [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions.

### How to Implement

1. **Identify Extreme RSI Levels**: Look for instances where the RSI is above 70 ([overbought](../o/overbought.md)) or below 30 ([oversold](../o/oversold.md)).
2. **Bollinger Band Confirmation**: At the same time, look for the price touching or breaching the upper band ([overbought](../o/overbought.md)) or the lower band ([oversold](../o/oversold.md)).
3. **Enter the [Trade](../t/trade.md)**: Enter a short position if the RSI is above 70 and the price is touching the upper band, or a long position if the RSI is below 30 and the price is touching the lower band.
4. **Set a Target**: The target can be the middle band or a specific price point based on historical support/resistance levels.
5. **Set Stop-Loss**: Place a [stop-loss order](../s/stop-loss_order.md) just outside the opposite Bollinger Band.

These strategies are not foolproof and should always be used in conjunction with other analysis tools and proper [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) techniques. Trading involves significant risks, and it's essential to perform thorough research and practice with virtual accounts before committing real [capital](../c/capital.md).

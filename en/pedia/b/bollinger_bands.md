# Bollinger Bands

Bollinger Bands are a type of statistical chart characterizing the prices and [volatility](../v/volatility.md) over time of a [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) or [commodity](../c/commodity.md), using a formulaic band consisting of [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) levels above and below a simple moving average (SMA). They were developed by John Bollinger, a prominent [technical analyst](../t/technical_analyst.md), and are used by traders worldwide to understand price fluctuations and potential trends.

## Key Components

The system includes three lines:
1. **Middle Band (Mid Band or MB)**: This is the Simple Moving Average (SMA) of the instrument's price.
2. **Upper Band (UB)**: This is calculated as the SMA plus a certain number of standard deviations (usually 2).
3. **Lower Band (LB)**: This is calculated as the SMA minus the same number of standard deviations.

The formulae are given below:
- Middle Band (MB) = SMA(n-periods)
- Upper Band (UB) = MB + ([standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) of the n-period closing prices * 2)
- Lower Band (LB) = MB - ([standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) of the n-period closing prices * 2)

## Calculation Steps

1. **Determine the Simple Moving Average (SMA)**: Compute the average of closing prices over a specific number of periods (commonly 20 days).
2. **Calculate the [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) over the same periods**: This is used to measure the price [volatility](../v/volatility.md).
3. **Upper and Lower Bands**: Add and subtract twice the [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) from the SMA to obtain the upper and lower bands.

## Usage in Trading

### Identifying Overbought and Oversold Conditions

- **[Overbought](../o/overbought.md) Condition**: When the price touches or exceeds the upper band, it is considered [overbought](../o/overbought.md). This signifies that the instrument may be overpriced and due for a [correction](../c/correction.md).
  
- **[Oversold](../o/oversold.md) Condition**: When the price touches or falls below the lower band, it is considered [oversold](../o/oversold.md). This indicates that the instrument may be underpriced and primed for an upward movement.

### Trend Following

Traders use the bands to identify the strength and direction of a [trend](../t/trend.md):
- **[Uptrend](../u/uptrend.md)**: During an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md), prices generally move within the upper part of the band.
- **[Downtrend](../d/downtrend.md)**: In a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md), the prices generally move within the lower part.

### Volatility Indicators

The width of the Bollinger Bands themselves indicates [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md):
- **High [Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: If the bands widen, it signals increased [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md).
- **Low [Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: If the bands contract, it typically suggests decreased [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

## Advantages and Limitations

### Advantages
1. **Flexibility**: Bollinger Bands can be used across various financial instruments including [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, forex, and commodities.
2. **[Visibility](../v/visibility.md) of [Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: They [offer](../o/offer.md) clear [visibility](../v/visibility.md) of [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md).
3. **Customizable**: Traders can customize the number of periods and the [multiplier](../m/multiplier.md) for [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) to fine-tune the bands according to different [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

### Limitations
1. **[Lagging Indicator](../l/lagging_indicator.md)**: Like many indicators based on moving averages, Bollinger Bands are lagging and signals may be late.
2. **[False Signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md)**: They may produce [false signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md), especially in markets with no clear [trend](../t/trend.md).
3. **Dependency on [Market](../m/market.md) Conditions**: The effectiveness of Bollinger Bands can vary with different [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

## Advanced Strategies with Bollinger Bands

### Bollinger Squeeze

The Bollinger Squeeze is a [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) using the Bollinger Bands and the [Keltner Channels](../k/keltner_channels.md). It is based on the idea that periods of low [volatility](../v/volatility.md) are often followed by periods of high [volatility](../v/volatility.md). The strategy involves:
1. **Identifying Squeeze**: When Bollinger Bands move inside the [Keltner Channels](../k/keltner_channels.md), it indicates a period of low [volatility](../v/volatility.md) (squeeze).
2. **Trading the [Breakout](../b/breakout.md)**: [Trade](../t/trade.md) in the direction of the [breakout](../b/breakout.md) when the Bollinger Bands move outside the [Keltner Channels](../k/keltner_channels.md).

### Bollinger Band Breakout

This strategy can involve entering long or short positions based on the price moving above or below the bands:
- **Long Position**: Enter a long position when the price breaks upward out of the upper band, which suggests a potential continuation of an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md).
- **Short Position**: Enter a short position when the price breaks downward out of the lower band, suggesting a potential continuation of a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md).

## Combining Bollinger Bands with Other Indicators

To mitigate [false signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md) and improve the effectiveness of Bollinger Bands, they are often used in conjunction with other [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) such as:
1. **[Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (RSI)**: To confirm [overbought](../o/overbought.md) and [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions.
2. **Moving Average Convergence [Divergence](../d/divergence.md) (MACD)**: To identify [trend](../t/trend.md) changes.
3. **[Volume Indicators](../v/volume_indicators.md)**: To confirm the strength of price moves.

## Examples and Use Cases

### Forex Market
Forex traders frequently use Bollinger Bands to [trade](../t/trade.md) [currency](../c/currency.md) pairs due to their ability to adapt to changes in [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

### Stock Market
Stock traders use Bollinger Bands to identify buying and selling opportunities in equities. For instance, if a stock price moves significantly outside the Bollinger Bands, a [trader](../t/trader.md) might anticipate a [reversal](../r/reversal.md).

### Commodity Trading
In [commodity](../c/commodity.md) trading, Bollinger Bands can help traders identify extreme price movements and potential [reversal](../r/reversal.md) points, which is crucial for highly volatile markets.

## Conclusion

Bollinger Bands serve as an essential tool in a [trader](../t/trader.md)'s arsenal, providing critical insights into [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and potential price movements. They help traders make more informed decisions by highlighting periods of high and low [volatility](../v/volatility.md), and potential [overbought](../o/overbought.md) or [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions. However, while they [offer](../o/offer.md) valuable signals, it's crucial to combine them with other indicators and [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) to enhance accuracy and avoid [false signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md).

Traders can adapt the parameters of Bollinger Bands to fit different assets and [market](../m/market.md) conditions, making them a versatile instrument in various [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). Whether used alone or in conjunction with other technical tools, Bollinger Bands remain a staple in [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md), benefiting both novice and experienced traders.

# Budget Variance

[Budget](../b/budget.md) variance is a crucial concept in financial management, touching upon the discrepancy between budgeted outcomes and the actual [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md). Such discrepancies matter not only to large corporations and small businesses but also to individual project managers and organizational units. Understanding, analyzing, and managing [budget](../b/budget.md) variances sets the framework for more accurate [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md) and control, [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), and strategic decision-making.

## Definition and Importance

### What is Budget Variance?

[Budget](../b/budget.md) variance is the difference between the budgeted or planned amount of [expense](../e/expense.md) or [revenue](../r/revenue.md) and the actual amount incurred or realized. Essentially, it quantifies how much the actual [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) deviates from the budgeted figures. [Budget](../b/budget.md) variance can be favorable (when revenues exceed budgeted figures or expenses are below budgeted figures) or unfavorable (when revenues fall short of budgets or expenses exceed budgets).

### Why is it Important?

1. **Financial Control**: [Budget](../b/budget.md) variance is integral for maintaining financial control. By measuring the variances, organizations can determine whether they are on track to meet their financial goals.
2. **Performance Evaluation**: It serves as a metric for evaluating the performance of different departments or projects within an organization.
3. **Decision-Making**: Insight into [budget](../b/budget.md) variances aids managerial decision-making by highlighting areas that need managerial attention.
4. **Accountability**: Holding departments or project managers accountable for [budget](../b/budget.md) variances fosters a culture of responsibility and precision.

## Types of Budget Variances

### Revenue Variance

[Revenue](../r/revenue.md) variance is the difference between the budgeted [revenue](../r/revenue.md) and the actual [revenue](../r/revenue.md) generated. This could be due to variations in sales [volume](../v/volume.md), pricing, or [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

1. **Sales [Volume](../v/volume.md) Variance**: Difference due to changes in the number of units sold.
2. **Sales Price Variance**: Difference due to changes in the price per unit.
3. **[Market Share](../m/market_share.md) Variance**: Variance arising from gaining or losing [market share](../m/market_share.md).

### Expense Variance

[Expense](../e/expense.md) variance refers to discrepancies between the budgeted and actual amounts spent. It can stem from various areas within the cost structure of a company. Types include:

1. **Material Variance**: Difference in cost of [raw materials](../r/raw_materials.md).
2. **Labor Variance**: Difference in labor costs (salary, overtime).
3. **Overhead Variance**: Difference in allocated fixed and [variable overhead](../v/variable_overhead.md) costs.
4. **[Operating Expense](../o/operating_expense.md) Variance**: Changes in operational costs such as utilities, rent, or office supplies.

### Net Income Variance

Net [income](../i/income.md) variance is the overall difference between budgeted and actual net [income](../i/income.md). This is the aggregate impact of [revenue](../r/revenue.md) and [expense](../e/expense.md) variances on the profitability of an organization.

## Factors Influencing Budget Variance

Several internal and external factors can cause [budget](../b/budget.md) variance. These include:

1. **[Market](../m/market.md) Conditions**: Sudden changes in [market](../m/market.md) trends can lead to [revenue](../r/revenue.md) variances.
2. **Economic Factors**: [Inflation](../i/inflation.md), [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) rates, and [currency](../c/currency.md) fluctuations can impact both revenues and expenses.
3. **[Operational Efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md)**: Inefficiencies in operations, such as wastage or overuse of resources, can cause expenses to exceed budgets.
4. **Supplier Pricing**: Variations in supplier pricing for [raw materials](../r/raw_materials.md) or services can impact cost structures.
5. **Technological Changes**: Rapid technological changes can render existing technologies obsolete, leading to unexpected expenses.

## Methods for Analyzing Budget Variance

### Variance Analysis

[Variance analysis](../v/variance_analysis.md) is the broad set of methods employed to investigate and understand the reasons behind [budget](../b/budget.md) variances. Key steps in [variance analysis](../v/variance_analysis.md) include:

1. **Identifying Variances**: Calculating the difference between actual and budgeted amounts.
2. **Categorizing Variances**: Distinguishing between [revenue](../r/revenue.md), [expense](../e/expense.md), and net [income](../i/income.md) variances.
3. **Investigating Causes**: Delving deeper into the specific causes for each type of variance.
4. **Taking Corrective Actions**: Implementing changes to control future variances.

### Tools for Variance Analysis

Several [software tools](../s/software_tools_for_trading.md) and methodologies can assist in conducting [variance analysis](../v/variance_analysis.md):

1. **Excel Modeling**: Advanced Excel functions and pivot tables can be used to conduct detailed [variance analysis](../v/variance_analysis.md).
2. **[Business](../b/business.md) Intelligence (BI) Tools**: Applications like Tableau, Qlik, and Microsoft Power BI can visualize variances and trends.
3. **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Systems**: ERPs like SAP and Oracle provide comprehensive tools for tracking and analyzing [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md).

## Reducing and Preventing Unfavorable Variances

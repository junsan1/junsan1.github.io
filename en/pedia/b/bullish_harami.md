# Bullish Harami

A Bullish Harami is a [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) chart pattern used in [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) to indicate a potential [reversal](../r/reversal.md) in the [market](../m/market.md) from a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md) to an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md). The term "Harami" is derived from the Japanese word for "pregnant," and the pattern resembles this concept.

## Definition

The Bullish Harami pattern consists of two candles: 

1. **First Candle:** A large bearish candle (red or black) that represents a significant [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md). This candle has a large real body, indicating strong selling pressure.
2. **Second Candle:** A smaller bullish candle (green or white) that appears within the real body of the first candle. The second candle's body is contained entirely within the [range](../r/range.md) of the first candle's body, indicating a possible pause or [reversal](../r/reversal.md) of the prevailing [trend](../t/trend.md).

## Components

### First Candle

- **[Trend](../t/trend.md):** The [market](../m/market.md) should be in a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md), confirming a prevailing bearish sentiment.
- **Body:** The first candle is typically long and bearish, representing strong downward [momentum](../m/momentum.md). 
- **Shadows:** The shadows (or wicks) can vary in length, but the essential part is the size of the real body showing a definitive bearish move.

### Second Candle

- **Body:** The second candle must be smaller than the first and be completely contained within the first candle's body. It is usually a bullish candle, indicating a potential [reversal](../r/reversal.md).
- **Positioning:** The second candle's opening and closing prices are within the previous day's real body.
- **Shadows:** The second candle should generally have smaller shadows compared to the first.

## Significance

The Bullish Harami pattern is significant because it indicates a potential end to a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md) and a possible beginning of an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md). The smaller second candle implies that the bears have lost [momentum](../m/momentum.md), and the bulls may be gaining strength. However, confirmation from subsequent candles is usually preferred to verify the [reversal](../r/reversal.md).

## Market Psychology

The psychology behind a Bullish Harami pattern involves a transition from bearish to bullish sentiment:
 
- **First Candle:** Reflects the [market](../m/market.md)'s overall bearish sentiment, capturing a continuation of a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md).
- **Second Candle:** Indicates [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) and weakening of selling pressure. The smaller bullish candle within the previous bearish candle's [range](../r/range.md) suggests that sellers may be exhausted and buyers could be stepping back in.

## Confirmation

To confirm a Bullish Harami pattern and increase the reliability of the signal, traders often look for the following:

1. **[Volume](../v/volume.md):** A noticeable increase in [volume](../v/volume.md) during the formation of the second candle can indicate stronger buying [interest](../i/interest.md).
2. **Subsequent Bullish Candles:** Further bullish candles following the Harami pattern signal that the [trend reversal](../t/trend_reversal.md) is more likely.
3. **[Technical Indicators](../t/technical_indicator.md):** Complementary indicators, like [Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (RSI), Moving Average Convergence [Divergence](../d/divergence.md) (MACD), or other [momentum indicators](../m/momentum_indicators.md) showing [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions can add credence to the [reversal](../r/reversal.md) signal.

## Example of a Bullish Harami

Consider a stock that has been in a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md) for several weeks. The previous trading day closes with a long bearish candle, showing that sellers are still in control. The following day opens with a price gap higher, it trades within a narrow [range](../r/range.md), and closes higher, but within the [range](../r/range.md) of the previous day's candle. This [price action](../p/price_action.md) forms a Bullish Harami pattern on the chart, indicating a potential [reversal](../r/reversal.md).

## Strategies for Trading a Bullish Harami

### Entry Points

Traders can enter the [market](../m/market.md) after identifying a Bullish Harami pattern. Entry points might include:

- **Confirmation Candle:** Entering a long position after the price moves above the high of the second candle in the Harami pattern.
- **[Breakout](../b/breakout.md) Strategy:** Placing a [buy stop order](../b/buy_stop_order.md) slightly above the high of the first candle to catch the [breakout](../b/breakout.md) when it happens.
- **[Support Levels](../s/support_levels.md):** Combining the Harami pattern with [support levels](../s/support_levels.md) to increase the likelihood of a successful [trade](../t/trade.md).

### Stop-Loss and Take-Profit

To manage [risk](../r/risk.md), traders should:

- **Stop-Loss:** Place a [stop-loss order](../s/stop-loss_order.md) below the low of the first candle to protect against [false signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md). The exact distance can be determined based on [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) and [volatility](../v/volatility.md).
- **Take-[Profit](../p/profit.md):** Establish take-[profit](../p/profit.md) levels based on resistance levels, previous highs, or a fixed [risk](../r/risk.md)-reward ratio. [Trend](../t/trend.md) lines and [Fibonacci retracement](../f/fibonacci_retracement.md) levels can also be useful for determining exit points.

## Limitations and Risks

While the Bullish Harami pattern is useful, it is not infallible. Traders should consider the following limitations and risks:

1. **[False Signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md):** The pattern can sometimes produce [false signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md) in ranging or sideways markets where the [trend](../t/trend.md) is not well-defined.
2. **Need for Confirmation:** It often requires confirmation from subsequent [price action](../p/price_action.md) or other [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicator.md) to increase its reliability.
3. **[Market](../m/market.md) Context:** It may be less effective in very strong trends without other supporting signs of a [reversal](../r/reversal.md).

## Real-World Application

### Example in the Stock Market

In the [stock market](../s/stock_market.md), a Bullish Harami pattern can be found in various [stocks](../s/stock.md), ETFs, and indices. For instance:

- **Company Name:** Apple Inc. (AAPL)
  - Stock Chart: [Apple Inc. (AAPL) Chart](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)
  - Observing the daily, weekly, or monthly charts, traders can identify Bullish Harami patterns to make informed trading decisions.

### Example in the Forex Market

In the Forex [market](../m/market.md), [currency](../c/currency.md) pairs often exhibit Bullish Harami patterns:

- **[Currency](../c/currency.md) Pair:** EUR/USD
  - Forex Chart: [EUR/USD Chart](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=FX:EURUSD)
  - [Technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) on [currency](../c/currency.md) pairs can reveal potential [trend](../t/trend.md) reversals, providing opportunities for long trades.

## Conclusion

The Bullish Harami is a widely recognized and respected pattern in [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md), useful for spotting potential reversals from bearish to bullish trends. While powerful, it is essential to confirm the pattern using other analysis tools and [market](../m/market.md) contexts to improve trading success. As with any [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md), [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) and proper planning are crucial to maximizing returns and minimizing risks.

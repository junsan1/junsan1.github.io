# Bond Market

## Definition and Overview of Bonds
A [bond](../b/bond.md) is a fixed-[income](../i/income.md) instrument that represents a [loan](../l/loan.md) made by an [investor](../i/investor.md) to a borrower, typically corporate or governmental. Bonds are used by these entities to [finance](../f/finance.md) projects and activities. Companies, municipalities, states, and sovereign governments all use bonds to raise [money](../m/money.md). Owners of bonds are debtholders, or creditors, of the [issuer](../i/issuer.md).

## Key Characteristics of Bonds
### Face Value (Par Value)
The [face value](../f/face_value.md) of a [bond](../b/bond.md) is the [principal](../p/principal.md) amount that the [bondholder](../b/bondholder.md) [will](../w/will.md) receive at the [bond](../b/bond.md)'s [maturity](../m/maturity.md). It is also the amount used to calculate [interest](../i/interest.md) payments. The [face value](../f/face_value.md) is typically $1,000 or $100 for corporate and [municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md).

### Coupon Rate
The [coupon rate](../c/coupon_rate.md) is the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) the [bond](../b/bond.md) [issuer](../i/issuer.md) [will](../w/will.md) pay on the [face value](../f/face_value.md) of the [bond](../b/bond.md), expressed as a percentage. For example, a [bond](../b/bond.md) with a [coupon rate](../c/coupon_rate.md) of 5 percent and a [face value](../f/face_value.md) of $1,000 [will](../w/will.md) pay $50 annually.

### Maturity Date
The [maturity date](../m/maturity_date.md) is the date on which the [principal](../p/principal.md) amount of a [bond](../b/bond.md) is to be paid in full. Bonds can have short-term maturities of a year or less, intermediate-term maturities of 2 to 10 years, or long-term maturities of 30 or more years.

### Yield
[Yield](../y/yield.md) refers to the [earnings](../e/earnings.md) generated and realized on an investment over a particular period of time, expressed as a percentage based on the invested amount or the current [market value](../m/market_value.md) or [face value](../f/face_value.md) of the [security](../s/security.md).

### Credit Quality
[Credit](../c/credit.md) quality is the [risk](../r/risk.md) of the [bond](../b/bond.md) [issuer](../i/issuer.md) defaulting on their [debt](../d/debt.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md). Ratings agencies assess issuers' [credit](../c/credit.md) quality and assign ratings that indicate their [default risk](../d/default_risk.md). High [credit](../c/credit.md) quality bonds, like those issued by the [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md), have lower yields due to lower [risk](../r/risk.md), while lower-quality bonds, like high-[yield](../y/yield.md) or "junk" bonds, [offer](../o/offer.md) higher yields to compensate for higher [risk](../r/risk.md).

## Types of Bonds
### Government Bonds
Government bonds are issued by a national government and are often considered low-[risk](../r/risk.md) investments.

#### U.S. Treasury Securities
Treasury securities include Treasury bonds, [Treasury notes](../t/treasury_notes.md), and Treasury bills, all of which are backed by the full faith and [credit](../c/credit.md) of the U.S. government.

* **Treasury Bills (T-Bills):** Short-term securities that mature in a year or less.
* **[Treasury Notes](../t/treasury_notes.md) (T-Notes):** Intermediate-term securities that mature in 2, 3, 5, 7, or 10 years.
* **Treasury Bonds (T-Bonds):** Long-term securities that typically mature in 20 or 30 years.

#### Municipal Bonds
[Municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md) are issued by states, cities, counties, and other governmental entities to [fund](../f/fund.md) public projects such as schools, highways, and hospitals. These bonds are often exempt from federal [taxes](../t/taxes.md) and, in some cases, state and local [taxes](../t/taxes.md).

### Corporate Bonds
Corporate bonds are issued by companies to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) for [expansion](../e/expansion.md), acquisitions, and other activities. They typically [offer](../o/offer.md) higher yields than government bonds but come with higher [risk](../r/risk.md).

### High-Yield Bonds (Junk Bonds)
High-[yield](../y/yield.md) bonds have lower [credit](../c/credit.md) ratings and [offer](../o/offer.md) higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates to compensate for the increased [risk](../r/risk.md) of [default](../d/default.md). These bonds are issued by companies with lower [credit](../c/credit.md) quality and are also known as "junk bonds."

### International Bonds
International bonds are issued by non-U.S. entities. These include sovereign bonds issued by foreign governments and Eurobonds, which are international bonds issued in a [currency](../c/currency.md) not native to the [issuer](../i/issuer.md)'s country.

### Convertible Bonds
Convertible bonds can be converted into a specified number of [shares](../s/shares.md) of the issuing company's stock. They [offer](../o/offer.md) the benefits of [fixed-income security](../f/fixed-income_security.md) with the potential for [equity](../e/equity.md) [upside](../u/upside.md).

## Bond Market Participants
### Issuers
Issuers are the entities that sell bonds. This includes governments (municipalities, states, federal governments), corporations, and other entities that need to raise funds.

### Investors
Investors purchase bonds as part of their investment portfolio. They can include individual investors, mutual funds, pension funds, and [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies.

### Underwriters
Underwriters are financial institutions that help issuers bring their bonds to [market](../m/market.md). They buy the bonds from the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) and sell them to investors.

## Bond Market Indices
[Bond](../b/bond.md) [market](../m/market.md) indices are tools used to measure and track the performance of various segments of the [bond](../b/bond.md) [market](../m/market.md).

* **[Bloomberg](../b/bloomberg.md) Barclays U.S. Aggregate [Bond](../b/bond.md) [Index](../i/index.md):** A broad-based flagship [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) that measures the [investment grade](../i/investment_grade.md), U.S. dollar-denominated, fixed-rate taxable [bond](../b/bond.md) [market](../m/market.md).
* **[Merrill Lynch](../m/merrill_lynch.md) U.S. High [Yield](../y/yield.md) Master II [Index](../i/index.md):** Tracks the performance of below investment-grade, U.S. dollar-denominated corporate bonds.
* **S&P National AMT-Free [Municipal Bond](../m/municipal_bond.md) [Index](../i/index.md):** Measures U.S. [municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md) with high [credit](../c/credit.md) quality and tax exemptions.

## Yield Curve
The [yield curve](../y/yard.md) graphically represents the relationship between [bond](../b/bond.md) yields and maturities. It shows the [yield](../y/yield.md) of bonds at different maturities. The typical [yield curve](../y/yard.md) is upward sloping, indicating that longer-term bonds have higher yields to compensate for increased [risk](../r/risk.md) over time.

## Bond Pricing
[Bond](../b/bond.md) prices are inversely related to [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. When [interest](../i/interest.md) rates rise, [bond](../b/bond.md) prices fall, and vice versa. This is because the fixed [interest](../i/interest.md) payments of a [bond](../b/bond.md) become less attractive when new bonds are issued at higher rates.

### Discount and Premium
Bonds can be traded above ([premium](../p/premium.md)) or below ([discount](../d/discount.md)) their [face value](../f/face_value.md). A [bond](../b/bond.md) selling below its [face value](../f/face_value.md) is said to be at a [discount](../d/discount.md), while one selling above its [face value](../f/face_value.md) is at a [premium](../p/premium.md).

## Bond Rating Agencies
[Rating](../r/rating.md) agencies assess the [credit](../c/credit.md) quality of [bond](../b/bond.md) issuers and assign ratings that reflect the [issuer](../i/issuer.md)'s ability to make timely [interest](../i/interest.md) and [principal](../p/principal.md) payments.

* **Moody's Investors Service**
* **Standard & Poor's (S&P)**
* **[Fitch Ratings](../f/fitch_ratings.md)**

## Risks Associated with Bonds
### Interest Rate Risk
[Interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md) is the potential for investment losses due to a rise in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, which cause [bond](../b/bond.md) prices to fall.

### Credit Risk
[Credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) is the possibility that a [bond](../b/bond.md) [issuer](../i/issuer.md) might [default](../d/default.md) on its [payment](../p/payment.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md).

### Inflation Risk
[Inflation](../i/inflation.md) [risk](../r/risk.md) is the [risk](../r/risk.md) that the [value](../v/value.md) of [bond](../b/bond.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) payments and [principal](../p/principal.md) [will](../w/will.md) be eroded by [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

### Liquidity Risk
[Liquidity risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md) is the [risk](../r/risk.md) that a [bondholder](../b/bondholder.md) [will](../w/will.md) not be able to sell a [bond](../b/bond.md) quickly at its current [market value](../m/market_value.md).

## Bond Trading Platforms
There are several electronic trading platforms and marketplaces where bonds are bought and sold.

* **[Bloomberg Terminal](../b/bloomberg_terminal.md) (www.[bloomberg](../b/bloomberg.md).com/professional/solution/[bloomberg](../b/bloomberg.md)-terminal):** A widely used platform for trading bonds and other financial instruments.
* **Tradeweb (www.tradeweb.com):** An electronic marketplace for institutional, wholesale, and retail fixed-[income](../i/income.md) and [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) markets.
* **[MarketAxess](../m/marketaxess.md) (www.[marketaxess](../m/marketaxess.md).com):** Provides a platform for trading corporate bonds and other fixed-[income](../i/income.md) instruments.

## Bond Strategies and Techniques
### Buy and Hold
This strategy involves purchasing bonds and holding them until [maturity](../m/maturity.md), collecting [interest](../i/interest.md) payments along the way.

### Laddering
[Laddering](../l/laddering.md) involves purchasing bonds with staggered maturities. This strategy helps manage [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md) and keeps funds available at regular intervals.

### Bond Swapping
[Bond](../b/bond.md) swapping consists of selling one [bond](../b/bond.md) and using the proceeds to purchase another. This can be done to improve [yield](../y/yield.md), manage tax liabilities, or adjust the portfolio's [risk](../r/risk.md) profile.

## Conclusion
The [bond](../b/bond.md) [market](../m/market.md) is a central component of the global [financial system](../f/financial_system.md), providing a mechanism for entities to raise funds and for investors to earn returns on their [capital](../c/capital.md). Understanding the complexities of bonds, including their characteristics, types, risks, and trading platforms, is essential for anyone interested in fixed-[income](../i/income.md) investments.

While the [bond](../b/bond.md) [market](../m/market.md) can seem intricate, it offers various opportunities for [income](../i/income.md) and [diversification](../d/diversification.md), making it a valuable area of study for investors of all levels.

# BAT Stocks

## Introduction to BAT Stocks

BAT stocks refer to three major technology companies in China. The acronym stands for Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent. These companies are often compared to the FAANG stocks in the United States, which include Facebook (now Meta), Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google (now Alphabet). BAT stocks are essential for anyone interested in the technology sector, particularly in the context of emerging markets like China. This article delves into each of these companies, their significance, financial performance, business models, and more.

## Baidu

Baidu Inc. is a Chinese multinational technology company specializing in internet-related services and products, and artificial intelligence (AI). Often dubbed as "the Google of China," Baidu commands a significant share of the search engine market in China.

Baidu was founded in 2000 by Robin Li and Eric Xu. Robin Li's background in search engine development led to the inception of Baidu, which has evolved into a tech giant over the last two decades. The company quickly grew to dominate the Chinese search engine market, benefitting from the Internet boom and the relatively unchallenged landscape in China.

### Business Model

Baidu’s business model revolves around online advertising, similar to Google. Advertisements are shown on its search engine platform, which generates most of the company's revenue. However, Baidu has diversified its revenue streams through various other businesses, including AI cloud services, autonomous driving, and smart devices.

### Financial Performance

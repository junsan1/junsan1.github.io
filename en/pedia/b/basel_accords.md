# Basel Accords

The Basel Accords are a series of recommendations and regulations issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), aimed at strengthening the regulation, supervision, and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) of banks globally. The accords play a crucial role in the global [financial system](../f/financial_system.md), ensuring stability and reducing systemic risks by establishing comprehensive frameworks for [capital](../c/capital.md) adequacy, [stress testing](../s/stress_testing.md), and [market](../m/market.md) [liquidity risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md).

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the Basel Accords is to strengthen the regulation, supervision, and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) within the banking sector. The accords provide a set of standardized practices that banks can use to manage risks, especially those related to [credit](../c/credit.md), [market](../m/market.md), and operational risks.

Basel Accords aim to:

- Increase the resilience of the banking sector.
- Promote a level playing field by reducing competitive inequalities.
- Enhance [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and disclosures for risks and [capital](../c/capital.md) adequacy.
- Strengthen the overall [financial system](../f/financial_system.md) to guard against economic shocks.

## Pillars of Basel Accords

The Basel Accords consist of different frameworks, collectively known as [Basel I](../b/basel_i.md), [Basel II](../b/basel_ii.md), [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md), and in some discussions, Basel IV. Each of these frameworks introduces new regulations and requirements to keep up with the evolving nature of global banking and [finance](../f/finance.md).

### Basel I

The first Basel Accord was introduced in 1988 and was primarily focused on [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md). [Basel I](../b/basel_i.md) established minimum [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements for banks, with a strong emphasis on [capital](../c/capital.md) adequacy measured against the [risk-weighted assets](../r/risk-weighted_assets.md) of the banks.

#### Key Features:

- Minimum [Capital](../c/capital.md) Requirement: The ratio of [capital](../c/capital.md) to [risk-weighted assets](../r/risk-weighted_assets.md) should be at least 8%.
- [Risk](../r/risk.md) Weights: Assets are categorized into different [risk](../r/risk.md) categories, and [risk](../r/risk.md) weights are assigned accordingly.

### Basel II

Introduced in 2004, [Basel II](../b/basel_ii.md) aimed to further refine and expand the rules set by [Basel I](../b/basel_i.md). It emphasized the need for [risk](../r/risk.md)-sensitive approaches and introduced a three-pillar structure for banking regulation.

#### Three Pillars:

1. **Pillar 1: Minimum [Capital](../c/capital.md) Requirements**
   - [Credit Risk](../c/credit_risk.md): Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) approach and standardized approach.
   - [Market Risk](../m/market_risk.md): Use of [Value](../v/value.md) at [Risk](../r/risk.md) (VaR) models.
   - [Operational Risk](../o/operational_risk.md): Basic [Indicator](../i/indicator.md) Approach, Standardized Approach, and Advanced Measurement Approaches.

2. **Pillar 2: Supervisory Review Process**
   - Regulators are to ensure that banks have sound [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) processes in place.
   - Address risks that are not fully captured in Pillar 1.

3. **Pillar 3: [Market](../m/market.md) Discipline**
   - Increased [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) requirements.
   - Allowing [market](../m/market.md) participants to assess key pieces of information on banks' [capital](../c/capital.md), [risk](../r/risk.md) exposures, and [risk](../r/risk.md) assessment processes.

### Basel III

[Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md) was developed in response to the deficiencies in financial regulation revealed by the global [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) of 2007-2008. [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md) aimed to strengthen [bank capital](../b/bank_capital.md) requirements by increasing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and decreasing [leverage](../l/leverage.md).

#### Key Enhancements:

- **[Capital](../c/capital.md) Requirements:**
  - Higher minimum [capital](../c/capital.md) ratios.
  - Introduction of a new non-[risk](../r/risk.md)-based [leverage ratio](../l/leverage_ratio.md).
  - [Capital](../c/capital.md) Conservation Buffer and Countercyclical Buffer.
  
- **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Coverage:**
  - Improved capture of risks related to securitizations, trading books, and [counterparty](../c/counterparty.md) [credit](../c/credit.md) risks.

- **[Leverage Ratio](../l/leverage_ratio.md):**
  - A backstop measure to address [model risk](../m/model_risk.md) and measurement errors.

- **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) Standards:**
  - [Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) [Coverage Ratio](../c/coverage_ratio.md) (LCR) to ensure short-term [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).
  - Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) to promote medium- and long-term stability.

### Basel IV

Though not officially termed Basel IV, the comprehensive reforms and adjustments proposed in the years following [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md), particularly around the end of 2017, have been informally labeled Basel IV. These reforms focus on addressing the [variability](../v/variability.md) in [risk-weighted assets](../r/risk-weighted_assets.md) and improving the comparability of [bank capital](../b/bank_capital.md) ratios.

#### Core Components:

- Revised Standardized Approaches for [credit](../c/credit.md) and operational risks.
- Constraints on the use of internal models by the banks for determining [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements.
- Output floor to ensure that internally calculated [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements are not less than a percentage of the standardized approach.

## History

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) was established by the central [bank](../b/bank.md) governors of the Group of Ten (G10) countries in 1974, in response to disruptions in the international [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). The objective was to improve supervisory standards and to act as a forum for regular cooperation among its member countries on banking supervisory matters.

### Key Milestones:

- **1988 - [Basel I](../b/basel_i.md):** Introduction of the Basel [Capital](../c/capital.md) Accord, focusing on [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) and establishing minimum [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements.
  
- **2004 - [Basel II](../b/basel_ii.md):** A more sophisticated framework introduced, emphasizing comprehensive [risk management](../r/risk_management.md).
  
- **2009 - 2010 (Post-crisis) - [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md):** In response to the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md), this framework intended to strengthen [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements, enhance [risk](../r/risk.md) coverage, and introduce new [leverage](../l/leverage.md) and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) standards.

- **2017 and onwards - Basel IV:** Continued revisions and enhancements to reduce [variability](../v/variability.md) in [risk-weighted assets](../r/risk-weighted_assets.md) and improve the comparability of [capital](../c/capital.md) ratios across banks.

## Member Countries

The Basel Committeeâ€™s membership has grown over the years to include 45 members from 28 jurisdictions, reflecting a widening international [scope](../s/scope.md). The member countries play a significant role in shaping global banking standards and practices.

### G10 Members:

- Belgium
- Canada
- France
- Germany

### Non-G10 Members:

The committee also includes major emerging and developed markets such as Australia, Brazil, China, Hong Kong SAR, India, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, and South Korea, among others.

The Basel Committee collaborates closely with various international organizations and standard-setting bodies, including the Financial Stability Board (FSB), International Monetary [Fund](../f/fund.md) (IMF), and the [World Bank](../w/world_bank.md), to align global financial stability initiatives.

# Basel Accords

The Basel Accords are a series of recommendations and regulations issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), aimed at strengthening the regulation, supervision, and risk management of banks globally. The accords play a crucial role in the global financial system, ensuring stability and reducing systemic risks by establishing comprehensive frameworks for capital adequacy, stress testing, and market liquidity risk.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the Basel Accords is to strengthen the regulation, supervision, and risk management within the banking sector. The accords provide a set of standardized practices that banks can use to manage risks, especially those related to credit, market, and operational risks.

Basel Accords aim to:

- Increase the resilience of the banking sector.
- Promote a level playing field by reducing competitive inequalities.
- Enhance transparency and disclosures for risks and capital adequacy.
- Strengthen the overall financial system to guard against economic shocks.

## Pillars of Basel Accords

The Basel Accords consist of different frameworks, collectively known as Basel I, Basel II, Basel III, and in some discussions, Basel IV. Each of these frameworks introduces new regulations and requirements to keep up with the evolving nature of global banking and finance.

### Basel I

The first Basel Accord was introduced in 1988 and was primarily focused on credit risk. Basel I established minimum capital requirements for banks, with a strong emphasis on capital adequacy measured against the risk-weighted assets of the banks.

#### Key Features:

- Minimum Capital Requirement: The ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets should be at least 8%.
- Risk Weights: Assets are categorized into different risk categories, and risk weights are assigned accordingly.

### Basel II

Introduced in 2004, Basel II aimed to further refine and expand the rules set by Basel I. It emphasized the need for risk-sensitive approaches and introduced a three-pillar structure for banking regulation.

#### Three Pillars:

1. **Pillar 1: Minimum Capital Requirements**
   - Credit Risk: Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) approach and standardized approach.
   - Market Risk: Use of Value at Risk (VaR) models.
   - Operational Risk: Basic Indicator Approach, Standardized Approach, and Advanced Measurement Approaches.

2. **Pillar 2: Supervisory Review Process**
   - Regulators are to ensure that banks have sound risk management processes in place.
   - Address risks that are not fully captured in Pillar 1.

3. **Pillar 3: Market Discipline**
   - Increased transparency and disclosure requirements.
   - Allowing market participants to assess key pieces of information on banks' capital, risk exposures, and risk assessment processes.

### Basel III

Basel III was developed in response to the deficiencies in financial regulation revealed by the global financial crisis of 2007-2008. Basel III aimed to strengthen bank capital requirements by increasing liquidity and decreasing leverage.

#### Key Enhancements:

- **Capital Requirements:**
  - Higher minimum capital ratios.
  - Introduction of a new non-risk-based leverage ratio.
  - Capital Conservation Buffer and Countercyclical Buffer.
  
- **Risk Coverage:**
  - Improved capture of risks related to securitizations, trading books, and counterparty credit risks.

- **Leverage Ratio:**
  - A backstop measure to address model risk and measurement errors.

- **Liquidity Standards:**
  - Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) to ensure short-term liquidity.
  - Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) to promote medium- and long-term stability.

### Basel IV

Though not officially termed Basel IV, the comprehensive reforms and adjustments proposed in the years following Basel III, particularly around the end of 2017, have been informally labeled Basel IV. These reforms focus on addressing the variability in risk-weighted assets and improving the comparability of bank capital ratios.

#### Core Components:

- Revised Standardized Approaches for credit and operational risks.
- Constraints on the use of internal models by the banks for determining capital requirements.
- Output floor to ensure that internally calculated capital requirements are not less than a percentage of the standardized approach.

## History

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) was established by the central bank governors of the Group of Ten (G10) countries in 1974, in response to disruptions in the international financial markets. The objective was to improve supervisory standards and to act as a forum for regular cooperation among its member countries on banking supervisory matters.

### Key Milestones:

- **1988 - Basel I:** Introduction of the Basel Capital Accord, focusing on credit risk and establishing minimum capital requirements.
  
- **2004 - Basel II:** A more sophisticated framework introduced, emphasizing comprehensive risk management.
  
- **2009 - 2010 (Post-crisis) - Basel III:** In response to the financial crisis, this framework intended to strengthen capital requirements, enhance risk coverage, and introduce new leverage and liquidity standards.

- **2017 and onwards - Basel IV:** Continued revisions and enhancements to reduce variability in risk-weighted assets and improve the comparability of capital ratios across banks.

## Member Countries

The Basel Committeeâ€™s membership has grown over the years to include 45 members from 28 jurisdictions, reflecting a widening international scope. The member countries play a significant role in shaping global banking standards and practices.

### G10 Members:

- Belgium
- Canada
- France
- Germany
- Italy
- Japan
- Netherlands
- Sweden
- Switzerland
- United Kingdom
- United States

### Non-G10 Members:

The committee also includes major emerging and developed markets such as Australia, Brazil, China, Hong Kong SAR, India, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, and South Korea, among others.

The Basel Committee collaborates closely with various international organizations and standard-setting bodies, including the Financial Stability Board (FSB), International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Bank, to align global financial stability initiatives.

## Conclusion

The Basel Accords have played a vital role in shaping the modern banking landscape, encouraging transparency, stability, and risk management in the global financial system. Each iteration of the Basel Accords builds upon the previous, continually adapting to the evolving complexities and requirements of the international banking environment. The Basel Accords provide a cornerstone for regulatory frameworks, influencing national regulations and global banking practices significantly.

The system also provides news, price quotes, and messaging across its proprietary, secure network. Bloomberg Terminal has established itself as one of the most powerful and vital tools for professionals in finance, investment, and algorithmic trading.

## Overview and History

Founded by former Salomon Brothers employee Michael Bloomberg in 1981, Bloomberg L.P. introduced the first iteration of what became the Bloomberg Terminal in 1982. The intention was to create a platform that could offer real-time market data alongside news and analytical tools. Initially marketed to bond traders, the Terminal quickly expanded its utility to include a broad spectrum of asset classes and financial instruments.

## Core Features

In addition to raw data, the platform features powerful tools for financial analysis, statistical modeling, and historical data review.

### Trading Capabilities

# Bitcoin Mining

[Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) [mining](../m/mining.md) is the process by which new bitcoins are entered into circulation, and it is also an essential component of the maintenance and development of the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) ledger. It is performed using very sophisticated computers that solve extremely complex computational math problems. [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) miners receive a reward when they successfully complete a block of verified transactions, which then get added to the immutable [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md).

## History of Bitcoin Mining

[Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) [mining](../m/mining.md) started as a [lucrative](../l/lucrative.md) endeavor around the time of [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md)'s creation in 2009 by the mysterious figure or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto. In the early days, [mining](../m/mining.md) could be performed profitably on regular desktops using the CPUs and GPUs that came with them. However, as more miners joined the [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) network, the difficulty of solving the puzzles increased, leading to the advent of more specialized hardware.

### CPU Mining

Initially, [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) [mining](../m/mining.md) was performed using the Central Processing Units (CPUs) of computers. The computational resources required to solve the cryptographic puzzles at that time were minimal, hence desktop computers with standard CPUs were sufficient.

### GPU Mining

As the difficulty increased, miners realized that Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) were more efficient at solving the SHA-256 hashing algorithm used in [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) [mining](../m/mining.md). GPUs offered significant performance benefits over CPUs as they are designed to perform [multiple](../m/multiple.md) calculations in parallel, a clear advantage when carrying out repeated hashing operations needed in [mining](../m/mining.md).

### ASIC Mining

Further improvements led to the development of Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), which are specialized hardware designed specifically for [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) [mining](../m/mining.md). ASICs made CPU and GPU [mining](../m/mining.md) obsolete for profitable enterprise-level miners due to their superior [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and speed.

## The Mining Process

### Transaction Verification

The [mining](../m/mining.md) process begins when a set of pending transactions is collected into a pool of unconfirmed transactions, often referred to as the "mempool." Miners select transactions from this pool and assemble them into a block, which they [will](../w/will.md) then attempt to add to the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md). 

### Hashing and Proof-of-Work (PoW)

To add a block to the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md), miners must solve a cryptographic puzzle. This puzzle involves repeatedly hashing the block's header with different [nonce](../n/nonce.md) values until the resulting [hash](../h/hash.md) meets a certain criteria. The criteria require that the [hash](../h/hash.md) be less than or equal to the current target, a [value](../v/value.md) that changes periodically as the network adjusts the difficulty.

### Block Reward

The first miner to find a valid [hash](../h/hash.md) broadcasts the block to the network, where other miners and nodes verify the validity of the block and the solution. Once verified, the block is added to the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md), and the successful miner receives a reward comprising newly minted bitcoins (block reward) and [transaction fees](../t/transaction_fees.md) from the transactions included in the block.

Currently, the block reward is set at 6.25 bitcoins for each successfully mined block, a [value](../v/value.md) that halves approximately every four years in an event known as the "halving." The next halving is expected to occur in 2024, reducing the block reward to 3.125 bitcoins.

## Mining Hardware

### CPU vs. GPU vs. ASIC

- **CPU [Mining](../m/mining.md)**: In the early days, CPUs were used, but they became inefficient with the increase in difficulty.
- **GPU [Mining](../m/mining.md)**: GPUs offered enhanced parallel processing capabilities, proving to be much more efficient than CPUs.
- **ASIC [Mining](../m/mining.md)**: ASICs are tailored for [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) [mining](../m/mining.md), providing even more processing power and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md). However, they are also more expensive and have no [utility](../u/utility.md) beyond [mining](../m/mining.md).

### Major Companies Producing Mining Equipment

- **Bitmain**: Known for its Antminer series of ASIC miners, Bitmain is one of the largest manufacturers in the [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) [mining](../m/mining.md) hardware [market](../m/market.md). [Bitmain](https://www.bitmain.com/)

- **MicroBT**: Another leading company in the ASIC [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) [industry](../i/industry.md), known for its Whatsminer series. [MicroBT](https://www.microbt.com/)

- **Canaan**: Produces the Avalon series of miners and was one of the first companies to produce ASIC [mining](../m/mining.md) chips. [Canaan](https://www.canaan.io/)

## Mining Pools

Given the increasing difficulty and competitiveness in [mining](../m/mining.md), individual miners often join [mining](../m/mining.md) pools to have a more consistent and predictable [income](../i/income.md). In a [mining](../m/mining.md) pool, participants contribute their processing power and share the block rewards proportionally based on the amount of computational work they contributed.

### Popular Mining Pools

- **AntPool**: Operated by Bitmain, one of the largest pools globally. [AntPool](https://www.antpool.com/)
- **Slush Pool**: Known as the world's first [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) [mining](../m/mining.md) pool, it still remains a significant player. [Slush Pool](https://slushpool.com/)
- **F2Pool**: One of the largest multi-[currency](../c/currency.md) [mining](../m/mining.md) pools. [F2Pool](https://www.f2pool.com/)

## Mining Software

Alongside hardware, miners need specialized software to connect with the [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) network and manage the [mining](../m/mining.md) process.

## Energy Consumption and Environmental Impact

[Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) [mining](../m/mining.md) is known for its significant energy consumption due to the large amount of computational power required. This has raised concerns about its environmental impact, particularly its carbon footprint. The debate around [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md)'s environmental impact continues, with some advocates suggesting solutions like the use of renewable energy sources and more efficient [mining](../m/mining.md) technology.

### Renewable Energy in Mining

Several [mining](../m/mining.md) operations have begun to utilize renewable energy in an effort to reduce their environmental impact. For example, hydroelectric power in regions like Sichuan, China, or geothermal energy in Iceland.

## Future of Bitcoin Mining

[Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) [mining](../m/mining.md) is continually evolving and future trends may include increased energy [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md), greater use of renewable sources, and possibly new consensus mechanisms or protocol changes to address environmental concerns.

Overall, [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) [mining](../m/mining.md) plays a crucial role in maintaining and securing the [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) network, rewarding miners who contribute computational power and adding [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and immutability to the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) ledger.

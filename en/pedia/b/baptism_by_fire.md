# Baptism by Fire

The phrase "baptism by fire" originally stems from a Biblical phrase found in the New Testament, specifically in the Gospel of Matthew 3:11, where John the Baptist says, "He [will](../w/will.md) baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire." Over time, the term has been secularized to describe intense, challenging, and often painful experiences that test an individual’s mettle.

# Board of Directors (B of D)

A **Board of Directors (B of D)** is a body of elected or appointed members who jointly oversee the activities of a company or organization. The board’s responsibilities are crucial to the governance and functioning of any corporation, both large and small. This topic delves into various aspects of the board, focusing on its structure, roles, responsibilities, and the significant impact it has on corporate governance and business outcomes.

## Definition and Purpose

The **Board of Directors** represents the apex of the corporate hierarchy, where crucial decisions guiding the company's strategy and operations are made. The board acts as a fiduciary for shareholders, ensuring the company's prosperity by collectively directing its affairs while meeting appropriate interests of its shareholders and stakeholders. 

## Structure of a Board

The structure can vary significantly from one organization to another, but typically, a board includes:

### Executive Directors

These are typically senior employees of the company who take on additional responsibilities as board members, combining their day-to-day operational knowledge with strategic oversight functions.

### Non-Executive Directors

Non-executive directors are not part of the company’s daily operations. Their primary role is to provide independent oversight and external perspectives, ensuring that the company’s interests remain aligned with broader shareholder and stakeholder expectations.

A subset of non-executive directors, independent directors are entirely free from any relationship with the company which might affect their unbiased judgment. They are particularly valuable for maintaining checks and balances.

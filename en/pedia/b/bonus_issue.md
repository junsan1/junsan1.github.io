# Bonus Issue

A bonus [issue](../i/issue.md), also known as a scrip [issue](../i/issue.md) or [capitalization](../c/capitalization.md) [issue](../i/issue.md), refers to the process by which a company provides additional [shares](../s/shares.md) to its existing shareholders without any extra cost, based on the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) that a [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) already owns. This corporate action is an alternative to paying dividends in cash and is often perceived as a way for companies to reward shareholders. However, from a financial perspective, a bonus [issue](../i/issue.md) does not change the overall [value](../v/value.md) of the company; rather, it simply increases the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) outstanding.

## Mechanism of Bonus Issue

When a company decides to [issue](../i/issue.md) bonus [shares](../s/shares.md), it converts part of its reserves, [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md), or share [premium](../p/premium.md) account into [equity](../e/equity.md) [capital](../c/capital.md). This conversion does not bring any additional cash into the company but reallocates the portion of reserves into share [capital](../c/capital.md). The process can be broken down into the following steps:

1. **Announcement:**
   The company’s board of directors announces the decision to [issue](../i/issue.md) bonus [shares](../s/shares.md) with details such as the ratio of bonus [shares](../s/shares.md) to existing [shares](../s/shares.md) (e.g., 1:2 bonus [issue](../i/issue.md) means one bonus share for every two existing [shares](../s/shares.md)).

2. **Approval:**
   The bonus [issue](../i/issue.md) decision needs to be approved by the shareholders in the company’s general meeting.

3. **[Record Date](../r/record_date.md):**
   The company sets a [record date](../r/record_date.md) to determine which shareholders are eligible to receive the bonus [shares](../s/shares.md). Only those who are shareholders as of that date [will](../w/will.md) receive the stock.

4. **Issuance:**
   After approval and on the [record date](../r/record_date.md), the company issues the bonus [shares](../s/shares.md) and credits them to the shareholders’ accounts.

## Impact on Shareholders and Stock Price

### Shareholding Pattern

- **Increase in number of [shares](../s/shares.md):**
   Shareholders [will](../w/will.md) [hold](../h/hold.md) more [shares](../s/shares.md) after the bonus [issue](../i/issue.md), but their percentage ownership in the company remains the same.
- **[Dilution](../d/dilution.md) of [value](../v/value.md):**
   The total [value](../v/value.md) of [shares](../s/shares.md) held by a [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) remains the same immediately after the bonus [issue](../i/issue.md) because the [market](../m/market.md) adjusts the stock price to reflect the increased number of [shares](../s/shares.md).

### Stock Price Adjustment

Post-bonus [issue](../i/issue.md), the share price typically adjusts downward. For example, if a [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) owns 100 [shares](../s/shares.md) at $10 each and receives a 1:1 bonus [issue](../i/issue.md) (100 additional [shares](../s/shares.md)), the total [shares](../s/shares.md) become 200. The stock price would likely adjust to $5 per share, keeping the total [value](../v/value.md) [unchanged](../u/unchanged.md) ($1000). This price adjustment is automatic and factored into trading on the ex-bonus date (the date when the stock starts trading without the [value](../v/value.md) of the bonus [shares](../s/shares.md)).

### Market Perception

- **Positive sentiment:**
   Often, bonus issues are perceived positively by the [market](../m/market.md) as a sign of confidence from the management in the company’s future prospects.
- **Temporary price movement:**
   While the [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) of the company does not change, there may be positive temporary price movements driven by [retail investor](../r/retail_investor.md) sentiment.

## Strategic Reasons for Bonus Issues

1. **Attractiveness to Investors:**
   By issuing bonus [shares](../s/shares.md), companies make their stock more affordable. A lower share price can attract small and retail investors, thus increasing the stock's [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).

2. **Utilization of Reserves:**
   Bonus issues allow companies to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) their reserves efficiently, showcasing the financial stability of the company.

3. **Signaling Effect:**
   Bonus [shares](../s/shares.md) can signal to the [market](../m/market.md) that the company has strong future [earnings](../e/earnings.md) prospects.

4. **[Dividend Policy](../d/dividend_policy.md):**
   For companies that cannot or prefer not to pay large cash dividends, issuing bonus [shares](../s/shares.md) serves as an alternative to reward shareholders.

## Examples of Bonus Issues

Many well-known companies regularly undertake bonus issues. For instance:

- **Reliance Industries:**
   One of the largest conglomerates in India, Reliance Industries has historically issued bonus [shares](../s/shares.md) to its investors. Information on their corporate actions can be found on their [official website](https://www.ril.com/).

- **Microsoft [Corporation](../c/corporation.md):**
   As a part of its [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) practices, Microsoft [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) has occasionally announced bonus issues. Detailed information is available on their [investor relations page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor).

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Bonus Issues

### Advantages

1. **[Shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) Reward:**
   Bonus [shares](../s/shares.md) reward loyal shareholders without the need for the company to disburse cash.
2. **Increased [Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md):**
   More [shares](../s/shares.md) in the [market](../m/market.md) enhance trading and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).
3. **Positive [Market Sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md):**
   Bonus issues can enhance the company’s [market](../m/market.md) image and [investor](../i/investor.md) confidence.
4. **[Capital Structure](../c/capital_structure.md) [Optimization](../o/optimization.md):**
   Utilizing reserves for issuing [shares](../s/shares.md) balances the company’s [equity](../e/equity.md) structure.

### Disadvantages

1. **No Change in Fundamental [Value](../v/value.md):**
   Although additional [shares](../s/shares.md) are issued, the fundamental [value](../v/value.md) and per-share [earnings](../e/earnings.md) of the company remain [unchanged](../u/unchanged.md).
2. **Potential Overvaluation:**
   Positive [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) can lead to short-term overvaluation.
3. **Administrative Costs:**
   The process involves administrative and regulatory compliance costs.

## Accounting for Bonus Issues

From an [accounting](../a/accounting.md) perspective, a bonus [issue](../i/issue.md) involves the transfer of an amount from reserves or [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md) to share [capital](../c/capital.md). Here are key steps:

1. **Debiting Reserves:**
   The [accounting](../a/accounting.md) entry involves debiting the appropriate reserve accounts (e.g., [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md)) to the extent of the bonus [issue](../i/issue.md).

2. **Crediting Share [Capital](../c/capital.md):**
   Simultaneously, the share [capital account](../c/capital_account.md) is credited with the total [nominal value](../n/nominal_value.md) of the newly [issued shares](../i/issued_shares.md).

Example [Journal](../j/journal.md) Entry:
```
   Dr. [Retained Earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md)                  $1,000,000
   Cr. Share [Capital](../c/capital.md)                     $1,000,000
```

## Regulatory Framework and Compliance

The regulatory requirements for bonus issues vary by country but generally include:

1. **Board Approval:**
   Initial approval by the company’s board of directors.

2. **[Shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) Approval:**
   Approval by shareholders in the annual general meeting or an extraordinary general meeting.

3. **Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) Regulations:**
   Compliance with stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md) listing regulations, such as prior intimation, [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md), and adjusting indices to reflect the bonus [issue](../i/issue.md).

4. **[Disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) Requirements:**
   Timely and transparent [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) to prevent any misinformation and enable informed [investor](../i/investor.md) decisions.

## Conclusion

Bonus issues are a strategic tool used by companies to reward shareholders, alter their [capital structure](../c/capital_structure.md), and sometimes enhance [market value](../m/market_value.md). While they do not immediately improve the [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) of a company, they can signify [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and future growth potential. Investors should understand the implications of bonus issues on their portfolio to make well-informed decisions. For companies, it is a balancing act between maintaining reserves and optimizing their [equity](../e/equity.md) base for long-term growth.

# Basic Materials

## Introduction

Basic materials, also known as raw materials, form the foundation of an economy's production capability. These materials are natural resources that are extracted or harvested and refined into forms that can be used in the creation of goods. Examples include metals (like steel and iron), chemicals, plastics, lumber, and minerals. They are essential in the manufacturing of numerous products, from simple household items to complex industrial machinery.

The sector encompassing these basic materials is often referred to as the Basic Materials sector, and it is one of the sectors commonly tracked by financial markets. Companies within this sector are involved in the extraction, processing, or refining of these primary materials. This sector also includes chemical companies, which convert raw materials into chemical products.

## Metals and Mining

Metals play a crucial role in economic development, serving as indispensable components in construction, manufacturing, and various industrial applications. The metals sub-sector includes:

### Precious Metals

Precious metals like gold, silver, and platinum are valued not only for their rarity and aesthetic appeal but also for their industrial applications and role as investment vehicles. Gold is perhaps the most well-known precious metal, often seen as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty.

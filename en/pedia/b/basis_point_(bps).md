# Basis Point (BPS)

A **[basis](../b/basis.md) point (BPS)** is a unit of measure used in [finance](../f/finance.md) to describe the [percentage change](../p/percentage_change.md) in the [value](../v/value.md) or rate of a [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md). One [basis](../b/basis.md) point is equal to 0.01%, or 1/100th of a percent. This unit of measurement is crucial in the fields of [finance](../f/finance.md) and [investing](../i/investing.md), specifically when dealing with [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, [equity](../e/equity.md) yields, the [valuation](../v/valuation.md) of bonds, and other financial instruments. The use of [basis](../b/basis.md) points helps to prevent ambiguity and ensures precision in financial communications and reporting.

## The Definition and Calculation of Basis Points

A [basis](../b/basis.md) point is a small but significant unit of measure. It is equal to:

\[1 \text{ BPS} = 0.01\% = \frac{1}{10000} = 0.0001\]

For example:
- An [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) that increases from 2.50% to 3.00% has increased by 50 [basis](../b/basis.md) points.
- A [bond yield](../b/bond_yield.md) that goes up from 4.20% to 4.45% has increased by 25 [basis](../b/basis.md) points.

### Formula for Conversion

To convert a [percentage change](../p/percentage_change.md) to [basis](../b/basis.md) points:
\[ \text{Basis Points} = \text{[Percentage Change](../p/percentage_change.md)} \times 100 \]

Conversely, to convert [basis](../b/basis.md) points back to a [percentage change](../p/percentage_change.md):
\[ \text{[Percentage Change](../p/percentage_change.md)} = \frac{\text{[Basis](../b/basis.md) Points}}{100} \]

For instance:
- A 0.5% [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) increase is equivalent to 50 [basis](../b/basis.md) points.
- 200 [basis](../b/basis.md) points can be converted back to a [percentage change](../p/percentage_change.md) as follows: 
\[ \frac{200}{100} = 2\% \]

## Importance of Basis Points in Finance

### Clarity in Communication

The specificity of [basis](../b/basis.md) points helps avoid misunderstandings. Rather than saying "the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) increased by 0.5%", which could be interpreted in different ways, financial professionals [will](../w/will.md) say "the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) increased by 50 [basis](../b/basis.md) points" to convey the exact change.

### Interest Rates

In the context of [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, even minor changes can have significant financial implications. Central banks, for instance, often adjust [interest](../i/interest.md) rates by increments of 25 or 50 [basis](../b/basis.md) points. This precision allows [market](../m/market.md) participants to understand and anticipate [market](../m/market.md) movements and policy changes.

### Bond Yields

In [bond](../b/bond.md) markets, a change in [yield](../y/yield.md) by a few [basis](../b/basis.md) points can dramatically affect the [bond](../b/bond.md) price. [Bond](../b/bond.md) traders and investors use [basis](../b/basis.md) points to gauge [yield](../y/yield.md) differences and spread more accurately.

### Equity Markets

While equities are generally discussed in percentage terms, [basis](../b/basis.md) points are sometimes used to describe very small changes in the [dividend](../d/dividend.md) yields or other financial metrics pertinent to the stock's [valuation](../v/valuation.md).

## Applications of Basis Points

### Central Bank Policies

Central banks around the world commonly use [basis](../b/basis.md) points to adjust [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md). For example, when the Federal Reserve (Fed) changes the [federal funds rate](../f/federal_funds_rate.md), it usually does so in increments of 25 [basis](../b/basis.md) points. These changes can influence borrowing costs, consumer spending, and overall economic activity.

### Loan and Mortgage Rates

Lenders use [basis](../b/basis.md) points to set or adjust [interest](../i/interest.md) rates on various loans and mortgages. For instance, if a [mortgage rate](../m/mortgage_rate.md) changes from 3.75% to 4.00%, it means there has been an increase of 25 [basis](../b/basis.md) points.

### Investment Performance

Investment funds often report their performance using [basis](../b/basis.md) points to show the effect of management fees and other costs. For example, a [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md) with an [expense ratio](../e/expense_ratio.md) of 1.50% has costs of 150 [basis](../b/basis.md) points.

### Credit Spreads

In [bond](../b/bond.md) markets, [credit](../c/credit.md) [spreads](../s/spreads.md) (the difference in [yield](../y/yield.md) between different types of bonds) are expressed in [basis](../b/basis.md) points. A spread widening from 150 [basis](../b/basis.md) points to 175 [basis](../b/basis.md) points, for instance, indicates greater perceived [risk](../r/risk.md) or changing [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Treasury Bonds

Consider a [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) [bond](../b/bond.md) with a [yield](../y/yield.md) of 2.45%. If the [yield](../y/yield.md) increases by 15 [basis](../b/basis.md) points, the new [yield](../y/yield.md) [will](../w/will.md) be:
\[ 2.45\% + \frac{15}{100} = 2.60\% \]

### Example 2: Federal Reserve Rate Change

If the Federal Reserve increases the [federal funds rate](../f/federal_funds_rate.md) by 50 [basis](../b/basis.md) points from 1.75%, the new rate would be:
\[ 1.75\% + \frac{50}{100} = 2.25\% \]

### Example 3: Mutual Fund Expense Ratio

A [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md) with an initial [return](../r/return.md) of 8.5% and an [expense ratio](../e/expense_ratio.md) of 100 [basis](../b/basis.md) points [will](../w/will.md) have an adjusted [return](../r/return.md) of:
\[ 8.5\% - \frac{100}{100} = 7.5\% \]

## Basis Points in Algorithmic Trading

In [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), [basis](../b/basis.md) points are essential for measuring performance, [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md), and [slippage](../s/slippage.md) (the difference between the expected price of a [trade](../t/trade.md) and the actual price). High-frequency traders, in particular, rely on [basis](../b/basis.md) points to fine-tune their strategies and maintain profitability.

### Strategy Tuning

[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) systems often make thousands of trades per day. Each [trade](../t/trade.md)’s profitability might only be a fraction of a percent, so changes are often measured in [basis](../b/basis.md) points. For instance, a strategy might be tuned to improve performance by 10 [basis](../b/basis.md) points, leading to a significant improvement over thousands of trades.

### Transaction Costs

[Transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md) can also be measured in [basis](../b/basis.md) points. For example, if the cost of buying and selling a stock totals 50 [basis](../b/basis.md) points, this directly impacts the algorithm’s net [profit](../p/profit.md).

### Slippage Measurement

[Slippage](../s/slippage.md) is a critical metric for algorithmic traders. By measuring [slippage](../s/slippage.md) in [basis](../b/basis.md) points, traders can more accurately assess the [execution](../e/execution.md) quality and make necessary adjustments to their algorithms.

## Conclusion

[Basis](../b/basis.md) points are a fundamental unit of measure in [finance](../f/finance.md), providing precision and clarity for various applications, including [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, [bond](../b/bond.md) yields, and [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md). Their importance is highlighted across [multiple](../m/multiple.md) financial domains, from central [bank](../b/bank.md) policies and [loan](../l/loan.md) rates to investment performance and [algorithmic trading strategies](../a/algorithmic_trading_strategies.md). By understanding and applying [basis](../b/basis.md) points, financial professionals can improve their communication, decision-making, and overall effectiveness in the [market](../m/market.md).

# Basis Risk

In the realm of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), [basis](../b/basis.md) [risk](../r/risk.md) refers to the [risk](../r/risk.md) that arises when the [hedge](../h/hedge.md) using [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), such as [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) or [options](../o/options.md), does not move perfectly in opposition to the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price movements. It's a significant concept for hedgers who rely on [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) to mitigate potential losses. Instead of eliminating [risk](../r/risk.md) completely, a [hedge](../h/hedge.md) might leave residual [risk](../r/risk.md) due to imperfect [correlation](../c/correlation.md) between the movements in the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) and the [derivative](../d/derivative.md) used for hedging. This residual [risk](../r/risk.md) is known as [basis](../b/basis.md) [risk](../r/risk.md).

## Understanding Basis Risk

[Basis](../b/basis.md) [risk](../r/risk.md) occurs because hedges are often not perfect and the [derivative](../d/derivative.md) used does not perfectly correlate with the [asset](../a/asset.md) being hedged. In financial terms, "[basis](../b/basis.md)" is the difference between the [spot price](../s/spot_price.md) of the [asset](../a/asset.md) and its corresponding [futures](../f/futures.md) price. Over time, as [market](../m/market.md) conditions vary, this [basis](../b/basis.md) can change, sometimes in unpredictable ways.

### Formula

[Basis](../b/basis.md) [risk](../r/risk.md) is quantitatively represented as:

\[ \text{Basis} = \text{[Spot Price](../s/spot_price.md) of [Asset](../a/asset.md)} - \text{[Futures](../f/futures.md) Price of [Asset](../a/asset.md)} \]

The potential for [basis](../b/basis.md) [risk](../r/risk.md) arises mainly in situations where the hedging instrument or strategy does not perfectly match the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) or exposure. 

### Example

Consider a wheat farmer who uses [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against the [risk](../r/risk.md) of wheat prices falling before the harvest. The farmer sells wheat [futures](../f/futures.md) to lock in a price. However, if the price of wheat in the [spot market](../s/spot_market.md) and the [futures market](../f/futures_market.md) do not move in perfect [correlation](../c/correlation.md) due to differences in [supply](../s/supply.md)-[demand](../d/demand.md) dynamics, storage costs, transportation issues, or other factors, the farmer [will](../w/will.md) experience [basis](../b/basis.md) [risk](../r/risk.md).

## Factors Contributing to Basis Risk

### 1. Liquidity Differences

[Market](../m/market.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) for different assets and their corresponding [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) can vary significantly. An [asset](../a/asset.md) might be less [liquid](../l/liquid.md) than its [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md), leading to price discrepancies as the [market](../m/market.md) adjusts for this difference.

### 2. Differences in Contract Specifications

[Futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) can have different contract specifications such as delivery dates, settlement methods, or contract sizes compared to the physical [asset](../a/asset.md). These differences can create discrepancies in price movements.

### 3. Time Effect

Over time, numerous factors such as changes in [supply](../s/supply.md)-[demand](../d/demand.md) dynamics or [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md) can impact the spot prices and [futures](../f/futures.md) prices differently, altering the [basis](../b/basis.md).

### 4. Supply and Demand Mismatches

In the case of commodities, changes in [supply](../s/supply.md) and [demand](../d/demand.md) can differentially affect the spot prices and [futures](../f/futures.md) prices, potentially increasing the [basis](../b/basis.md) [risk](../r/risk.md).

## Managing Basis Risk

Given that [basis](../b/basis.md) [risk](../r/risk.md) cannot be entirely eliminated, managing it effectively becomes crucial. Several strategies can be employed:

### 1. Choosing More Appropriate Hedging Instruments

Selecting hedging instruments that closely match the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) in terms of [market](../m/market.md) behavior can reduce [basis](../b/basis.md) [risk](../r/risk.md). For instance, a wheat farmer may prefer wheat [futures](../f/futures.md) that closely track the [spot price](../s/spot_price.md) of wheat.

### 2. Dynamic Hedging

This involves constant monitoring and adjusting the [hedge](../h/hedge.md) as [market](../m/market.md) conditions change to keep the [hedge](../h/hedge.md) in alignment with the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) exposure.

### 3. Conducting Thorough Market Research

Staying informed about [market](../m/market.md) conditions and the factors that influence [basis](../b/basis.md) levels can help in anticipating potential [basis](../b/basis.md) [risk](../r/risk.md) and taking pre-emptive actions.

### 4. Using Basis Swaps

[Basis](../b/basis.md) swaps specifically involve exchanging floating rates based on different [underlying](../u/underlying.md) rates. These swaps can be used to manage the [risk](../r/risk.md) arising from [basis](../b/basis.md) fluctuations.

## Examples of Basis Risk in Different Markets

### Commodities

In [commodity](../c/commodity.md) markets, [basis](../b/basis.md) [risk](../r/risk.md) is quite common due to variations in [seasonality](../s/seasonality.md), transportation costs, and local [demand](../d/demand.md)-[supply](../s/supply.md) conditions. For example, the price of [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md) and its corresponding [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) may diverge due to geopolitical issues affecting [supply](../s/supply.md) routes.

### Equities

When hedging [equity](../e/equity.md) positions using stock [index futures](../i/index_futures.md), [basis](../b/basis.md) [risk](../r/risk.md) can arise if the individual stock prices do not move in perfect [correlation](../c/correlation.md) with the [index](../i/index.md).

### Fixed Income

In the [fixed income](../f/fixed_income.md) [market](../m/market.md), if a [portfolio manager](../p/portfolio_manager.md) uses [interest rate futures](../i/interest_rate_futures.md) to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) a [bond](../b/bond.md) portfolio, the [basis](../b/basis.md) [risk](../r/risk.md) may crop up if the bonds do not move perfectly in line with the [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) due to differences in [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md), [duration](../d/duration.md), or other [bond](../b/bond.md)-specific factors.

### Foreign Exchange

In the [foreign exchange](../f/foreign_exchange.md) [market](../m/market.md), [basis](../b/basis.md) [risk](../r/risk.md) can occur when hedging [currency](../c/currency.md) exposure with [currency](../c/currency.md) [futures](../f/futures.md) or [options](../o/options.md), chiefly due to [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) differentials and varying political or [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md).

## Notable Examples of Companies Managing Basis Risk

## Conclusion

[Basis](../b/basis.md) [risk](../r/risk.md), while inevitable in the process of hedging, can be effectively managed through careful selection of hedging instruments, dynamic [hedging strategies](../h/hedging_strategies.md), thorough [market research](../m/market_research.md), and the use of [basis](../b/basis.md) swaps. Understanding and mitigating [basis](../b/basis.md) [risk](../r/risk.md) is essential for companies and investors involved in [derivative](../d/derivative.md) trading to ensure that their [hedging strategies](../h/hedging_strategies.md) provide the intended protection rather than exposing them to unforeseen risks.

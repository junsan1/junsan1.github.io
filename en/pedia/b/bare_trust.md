# Bare Trust

A bare trust, also known as a simple trust, is an arrangement where the trustee holds assets without any discretion in their distributionâ€”they must manage the assets and act solely according to the instructions given to them by the beneficiary or beneficiaries. Thus, the trustee acts only as a nominee, and the beneficiary has the right to the property and any income generated from it.

## Key Characteristics of Bare Trusts

1. **No Discretionary Powers**: The trustee in a bare trust has no discretionary powers over the assets held in trust. They must act according to the specific terms set down in the trust deed.
2. **Beneficiaries Identified**: The beneficiaries and their respective shares are specified at the outset and cannot be changed later.
3. **Simple Structure**: It has a straightforward structure, often used for holding shares, real estate, or other investments.
4. **Immediate Entitlement**: Beneficiaries have an immediate, absolute right to both the trust capital and the income generated.
5. **Taxation**: In many jurisdictions, the income and capital gains from the trust are taxed as if they belong directly to the beneficiaries.

## Advantages of Bare Trusts

1. **Simplicity**: They are easy to set up and operate, reducing administrative complexity.
2. **Direct Control for Beneficiaries**: Beneficiaries have direct control and immediate benefits from the assets held in trust.
3. **Tax Benefits**: Potential for favorable tax treatment, particularly for minor beneficiaries.

## Disadvantages of Bare Trusts

1. **Fixed Beneficiaries**: The inability to change beneficiaries might be a drawback in some circumstances.
2. **Lack of Flexibility**: No discretionary power means the trust lacks flexibility in asset management and distribution.
3. **Exposure to Beneficiaries' Financial Problems**: Assets are at risk if beneficiaries have financial difficulties or face legal claims.

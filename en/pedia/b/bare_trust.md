# Bare Trust

A bare [trust](../t/trust.md), also known as a simple [trust](../t/trust.md), is an arrangement where the [trustee](../t/trustee.md) holds assets without any discretion in their [distribution](../d/distribution.md)â€”they must manage the assets and act solely according to the instructions given to them by the [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md) or beneficiaries. Thus, the [trustee](../t/trustee.md) acts only as a nominee, and the [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md) has the right to the property and any [income](../i/income.md) generated from it.

## Key Characteristics of Bare Trusts

1. **No Discretionary Powers**: The [trustee](../t/trustee.md) in a bare [trust](../t/trust.md) has no discretionary powers over the assets held in [trust](../t/trust.md). They must act according to the specific terms set down in the [trust deed](../t/trust_deed.md).
2. **Beneficiaries Identified**: The beneficiaries and their respective [shares](../s/shares.md) are specified at the outset and cannot be changed later.
3. **Simple Structure**: It has a straightforward structure, often used for holding [shares](../s/shares.md), [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), or other investments.
4. **Immediate Entitlement**: Beneficiaries have an immediate, absolute right to both the [trust](../t/trust.md) [capital](../c/capital.md) and the [income](../i/income.md) generated.
5. **[Taxation](../t/taxation.md)**: In many jurisdictions, the [income](../i/income.md) and [capital](../c/capital.md) gains from the [trust](../t/trust.md) are taxed as if they belong directly to the beneficiaries.

## Advantages of Bare Trusts

1. **Simplicity**: They are easy to set up and operate, reducing administrative complexity.
2. **Direct Control for Beneficiaries**: Beneficiaries have direct control and immediate benefits from the assets held in [trust](../t/trust.md).
3. **Tax Benefits**: Potential for favorable tax treatment, particularly for minor beneficiaries.

## Disadvantages of Bare Trusts

1. **Fixed Beneficiaries**: The inability to change beneficiaries might be a drawback in some circumstances.
2. **Lack of Flexibility**: No discretionary power means the [trust](../t/trust.md) lacks flexibility in [asset management](../a/asset_management.md) and [distribution](../d/distribution.md).
3. **Exposure to Beneficiaries' Financial Problems**: Assets are at [risk](../r/risk.md) if beneficiaries have financial difficulties or face legal claims.

## Use in Algotrading

In the context of [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) (algotrading), bare trusts can be utilized for the following purposes:

1. **[Asset Management](../a/asset_management.md)**: Holding trading assets within a bare [trust](../t/trust.md) can [offer](../o/offer.md) tax efficiencies and a clear structure for investors.
2. **[Profit](../p/profit.md) Allocation**: Clear-cut [profit distribution](../p/profit_distribution.md) among beneficiaries can be efficiently achieved.
3. **[Investor](../i/investor.md) Clarity**: Investors have a transparent view of their entitlements and the performance of the assets held in [trust](../t/trust.md).

## Conclusion

Bare trusts serve as a useful tool in [asset management](../a/asset_management.md), [offering](../o/offering.md) simplicity and [transparency](../t/transparency.md). Despite some drawbacks regarding flexibility, their direct approach can be particularly effective in fields such as [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), where clearly defined [profit distribution](../p/profit_distribution.md) and tax [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) are crucial.

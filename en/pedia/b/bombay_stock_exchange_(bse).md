# Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE)

The Bombay Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (BSE) is one of the world's oldest stock exchanges and is located in Mumbai, India.

## History and Evolution

The BSE was founded by Premchand Roychand, a prominent [stockbroker](../s/stockbroker.md) of the time, who gathered with other traders under a banyan tree on Dalal Street in Mumbai.

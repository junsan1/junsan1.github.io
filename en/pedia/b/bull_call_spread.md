# Bull Call Spread

A [Bull](../b/bull.md) Call Spread is a popular [options](../o/options.md) [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) utilized in the [stock market](../s/stock_market.md) to [profit](../p/profit.md) from a moderate rise in the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). This spread involves buying call [options](../o/options.md) at a specific [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) while simultaneously selling the same number of call [options](../o/options.md) at a higher [strike price](../s/strike_price.md). The strategy is typically employed when an [investor](../i/investor.md) is moderately bullish on the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) and seeks to limit [risk](../r/risk.md) while attempting to make a [profit](../p/profit.md).

#### Key Components and Construction

1. **Long [Call Option](../c/call_option.md)**: This is the option that the [trader](../t/trader.md) buys. It grants the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at a designated [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) on or before the [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md). This [will](../w/will.md) incur a [premium](../p/premium.md) cost.
  
2. **[Short Call Option](../s/short_call_option.md)**: This is the option that the [trader](../t/trader.md) sells. It grants the right to another party to purchase the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at a higher [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) on or before the [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md). Selling the option generates a [premium](../p/premium.md), which helps [offset](../o/offset.md) the cost of the long [call option](../c/call_option.md).

#### Example of Bull Call Spread

Imagine you expect the stock of Company XYZ, currently priced at $100, to rise in the next month but want to limit your exposure. You execute a [Bull](../b/bull.md) Call Spread as follows:

- **Buy a [call option](../c/call_option.md)** with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $105 for a [premium](../p/premium.md) of $3 per share.
- **Sell a [call option](../c/call_option.md)** with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $110 for a [premium](../p/premium.md) of $1 per share.

Net cost of the spread = $3 (long call [premium](../p/premium.md)) - $1 ([short call](../s/short_call.md) [premium](../p/premium.md)) = $2

#### Potential Outcomes and Payoff Structure

1. **Stock Price Below $105**: Both call [options](../o/options.md) [will](../w/will.md) expire worthless. The [net loss](../n/net_loss.md) [will](../w/will.md) be the initial [net premium](../n/net_premium.md) paid, i.e., $2 per share.
  
2. **Stock Price Between $105 and $110**: The long [call option](../c/call_option.md) [will](../w/will.md) be in-the-[money](../m/money.md), and the [short call option](../s/short_call_option.md) remains out-of-the-[money](../m/money.md). The [profit](../p/profit.md) is derived from the difference between the stock price and the lower [strike price](../s/strike_price.md), minus the [net premium](../n/net_premium.md) paid.

3. **Stock Price Above $110**: Both [options](../o/options.md) [will](../w/will.md) be in-the-[money](../m/money.md). The maximum [profit](../p/profit.md) is achieved when the spread between the strike prices ($5) is greater than the [net premium](../n/net_premium.md) paid ($2). Thus, the [profit](../p/profit.md) = $5 - $2 = $3 per share.

#### Strategic Applications

The [Bull](../b/bull.md) Call Spread is an efficient strategy for investors who:

- **Expect limited upward movement**: Ideal for scenarios where a moderate increase in [asset](../a/asset.md) prices is anticipated.
- **Desire to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) risks**: Limits maximum loss to the [net premium](../n/net_premium.md) paid, contrasting with [unlimited risk](../u/unlimited_risk.md) scenarios like naked calls.
- **Seek to reduce [premium](../p/premium.md) cost**: Selling the [call option](../c/call_option.md) reduces the cost of establishing a long position as opposed to buying a single [call option](../c/call_option.md).

#### Time Decay and Volatility Impact

- **[Time Decay](../t/time_decay.md) ([Theta](../t/theta.md))**: [Time decay](../t/time_decay.md) [will](../w/will.md) have a variable effect. It increases the probability that both [options](../o/options.md) might expire worthless but reduces the [extrinsic value](../e/extrinsic_value.md) quicker in the nearer-the-[money](../m/money.md) option.
- **Implied [Volatility](../v/volatility.md) ([Vega](../v/vega.md))**: Movements in implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md) [will](../w/will.md) impact both legs of the spread equally. A rise in [volatility](../v/volatility.md) can increase the [value](../v/value.md) of the spread because the option premiums generally rise.

#### Bull Call Spread vs. Other Strategies

Comparing this strategy to others helps place its [utility](../u/utility.md) in context:

- **[Bull Put Spread](../b/bull_put_spread.md)**: A similar bullish strategy, but it involves selling a [put option](../p/put.md) and buying a lower strike put, benefiting from [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) and comparatively larger [credit](../c/credit.md).
- **Long Call**: Purely buying a [call option](../c/call_option.md) yields unlimited [upside](../u/upside.md) but involves a higher initial [premium](../p/premium.md) outlay.
- **[Covered Call](../c/covered_call.md)**: Writing calls against owned stock, delivering [income](../i/income.md) but capping [upside potential](../u/upside_potential_in_trading.md).

#### Risks and Drawbacks

- **Limited [Profit](../p/profit.md) Potential**: The spread strategy caps maximum profits to the difference between the two strike prices minus the [net premium](../n/net_premium.md) paid.
- **[Transaction Costs](../t/transaction_costs.md)**: [Multiple](../m/multiple.md) [options](../o/options.md) mean potentially higher brokerage fees, which could impact the overall [return](../r/return.md).

#### Conclusion

The [Bull](../b/bull.md) Call Spread is an essential strategy for traders aiming to balance potential gains with controlled risks. It offers an efficient way to [profit](../p/profit.md) from moderate bullish movements in an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price while significantly mitigating [risk](../r/risk.md) through clear-cut limits on both [profit](../p/profit.md) and loss.

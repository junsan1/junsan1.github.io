# Berhad (BHD)

Berhad is a suffix used in Malaysia to denote a publicly limited company and stands for "Berhad" in Malay, meaning "limited" as in "[limited liability](../l/limited_liability.md)". It is similar to the suffixes "PLC" (Public Limited Company) in the United Kingdom and "Inc." (Incorporated) in the United States. Companies that have "Berhad" at the end of their name are typically [listed](../l/listed.md) on the Bursa Malaysia, Malaysia's primary stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md), and are subject to strict regulatory prerequisites and reporting guidelines.

## Understanding Berhad Companies

A "Berhad" or BHD company is a type of [corporation](../c/corporation.md) in Malaysia where the shareholders' [liability](../l/liability.md) is limited to the amount of their investment. The formation and operational structure of Berhad companies are governed by the Companies Act 2016, which stipulates various requirements pertaining to [capital](../c/capital.md), governance, and [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md). 

Key characteristics of Berhad entities include:

1. **[Limited Liability](../l/limited_liability.md)**: Shareholders are only liable up to the amount unpaid on their [shares](../s/shares.md), protecting personal assets from company debts.

2. **Ownership and Share Transferability**: [Shares](../s/shares.md) in Berhad companies can be freely transferred, unlike in private limited companies (Sdn Bhd).

3. **Governance**: Berhad companies are required to appoint a board of directors and comply with rigorous statutory [obligations](../o/obligation.md). They must also [hold](../h/hold.md) annual general meetings (AGMs) and produce audited [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md).

4. **Public [Disclosure](../d/disclosure.md)**: Full [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) of financial information is mandatory, enhancing [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and [investor](../i/investor.md) confidence. 

## Formation of a Berhad Company

To establish a Berhad company in Malaysia, the following steps are typically followed:

1. **Name Reservation**: The proposed company name must be reserved and approved by the Companies [Commission](../c/commission.md) of Malaysia (SSM).

2. **Submission of Necessary Documents**: Documents such as the company constitution, statutory declaration of compliance, and particulars of directors and shareholders must be submitted to the SSM.

3. **[Incorporation](../i/incorporation.md) Process**: Upon approval, the company [will](../w/will.md) receive a Certificate of [Incorporation](../i/incorporation.md) indicating that it is legally recognized as a Berhad entity.

4. **[Capital](../c/capital.md) Requirement**: Generally, there is no minimum [paid-up capital](../p/paid-up_capital.md) requirement; however, companies intending to list on the stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md) may need to meet specific criteria (e.g., RM500,000 [paid-up capital](../p/paid-up_capital.md) for a listing on the ACE [Market](../m/market.md)).

## Key Regulatory Bodies

Berhad companies in Malaysia are primarily overseen by the following authorities:

- **Companies [Commission](../c/commission.md) of Malaysia (SSM)**: Responsible for the [incorporation](../i/incorporation.md) process, companies' registration, and ensuring compliance with statutory [obligations](../o/obligation.md).
  
- **Securities [Commission](../c/commission.md) Malaysia (SC)**: Regulates securities and future markets, fostering fair and transparent [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).
  
- **Bursa Malaysia**: The country's [principal](../p/principal.md) stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md), where publicly [listed](../l/listed.md) Berhad companies [trade](../t/trade.md) their [shares](../s/shares.md).

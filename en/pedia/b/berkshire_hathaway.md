# Berkshire Hathaway

## Introduction to Berkshire Hathaway

Berkshire Hathaway is an American multinational [conglomerate](../c/conglomerate.md) [holding company](../h/holding_company.md) headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska, United States. The company is widely known for its control and [leadership](../l/leadership.md) by Warren Buffett, who has served as the company's chairman and CEO since 1965. Under Buffett's [leadership](../l/leadership.md), Berkshire Hathaway has grown from a struggling textile company into one of the world's largest and most diversified corporations. The company owns a wide array of businesses, including [insurance](../i/insurance.md), utilities, railroads, [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md), and retail, among others.

## Historical Background

### Early Years

Berkshire Hathaway's origins date back to 1839 when Oliver Chace founded a textile [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) company named Valley Falls Company in Rhode Island. Over the years, the company underwent several mergers and changes, eventually becoming Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates in 1955. The modern name, Berkshire Hathaway, emerged from a 1955 [merger](../m/merger.md) between Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates and Hathaway [Manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md).

### Warren Buffett's Acquisition

Warren Buffett began buying [shares](../s/shares.md) in Berkshire Hathaway in the early 1960s, initially attracted by the [firm](../f/firm.md)'s [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) assets. By 1965, Buffett had acquired enough stock to take control of the company. At that time, the textile [business](../b/business.md) was struggling, but Buffett saw potential in the company's [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets and [financial health](../f/financial_health.md). Over time, he phased out the textile operations and redirected the company's focus towards acquiring and managing a diverse [range](../r/range.md) of businesses.

## Business Model and Structure

### Insurance and Reinsurance

One of the cornerstones of Berkshire Hathaway's [business](../b/business.md) model is its [insurance](../i/insurance.md) and [reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) operations. The company owns several prominent [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies, including GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway [Reinsurance](../r/reinsurance.md) Group, and General Re. These businesses provide a steady stream of [income](../i/income.md) and significant [capital](../c/capital.md) for [investing](../i/investing.md).

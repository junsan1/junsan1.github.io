# Berkshire Hathaway

## Introduction to Berkshire Hathaway

Berkshire Hathaway is an American multinational conglomerate holding company headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska, United States. The company is widely known for its control and leadership by Warren Buffett, who has served as the company's chairman and CEO since 1965. Under Buffett's leadership, Berkshire Hathaway has grown from a struggling textile company into one of the world's largest and most diversified corporations. The company owns a wide array of businesses, including insurance, utilities, railroads, manufacturing, and retail, among others.

## Historical Background

### Early Years

Berkshire Hathaway's origins date back to 1839 when Oliver Chace founded a textile manufacturing company named Valley Falls Company in Rhode Island. Over the years, the company underwent several mergers and changes, eventually becoming Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates in 1955. The modern name, Berkshire Hathaway, emerged from a 1955 merger between Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates and Hathaway Manufacturing.

### Warren Buffett's Acquisition

Warren Buffett began buying shares in Berkshire Hathaway in the early 1960s, initially attracted by the firm's undervalued assets. By 1965, Buffett had acquired enough stock to take control of the company. At that time, the textile business was struggling, but Buffett saw potential in the company's underlying assets and financial health. Over time, he phased out the textile operations and redirected the company's focus towards acquiring and managing a diverse range of businesses.

## Business Model and Structure

### Insurance and Reinsurance

One of the cornerstones of Berkshire Hathaway's business model is its insurance and reinsurance operations. The company owns several prominent insurance companies, including GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, and General Re. These businesses provide a steady stream of income and significant capital for investing.

### Non-Insurance Operations

Berkshire Hathaway's non-insurance operations are highly diversified and encompass a wide array of industries:

## Investment Philosophy

### Value Investing

Warren Buffett is renowned for his value investing philosophy, which he learned from Benjamin Graham, his mentor at Columbia Business School. The core principle of value investing involves buying undervalued stocks with strong fundamentals and holding them for the long term. Buffett looks for companies with durable competitive advantages, skilled management, and predictable earnings growth.

### Long-Term Focus

Buffett's investment strategy emphasizes a long-term approach, often holding investments for decades. This approach contrasts with the short-term trading mentality prevalent in the stock market. Berkshire Hathaway's significant investments in companies like Coca-Cola, Apple, and American Express exemplify this long-term focus.

### Acquisition Strategy

In addition to investing in publicly traded companies, Berkshire Hathaway regularly acquires entire businesses. Buffett prefers companies with strong management teams, simple business models, and stable earnings.

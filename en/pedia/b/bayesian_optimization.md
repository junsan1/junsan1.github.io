# Bayesian Optimization

Bayesian Optimization is a powerful strategy for the optimization of black-box functions, which are functions with inputs that are either continuous or discrete, where the objective function is expensive to evaluate. This approach is extensively utilized in fields such as machine learning, hyperparameter tuning, and automated [algorithm design](../a/algorithm_design.md), where the cost of function evaluation is high.

## Fundamental Concept

At its core, Bayesian Optimization constructs a probabilistic model—the surrogate model—of the objective function and uses this model to make decisions about where in the input space to evaluate next. The primary components of Bayesian Optimization include:

1. **Surrogate Model:** This is a probabilistic model that approximates the objective function. [Gaussian Processes](../g/gaussian_processes.md) (GPs) are commonly used as surrogate models due to their flexibility and capability to capture uncertainty.

2. **Acquisition Function:** This function determines the next point to evaluate by trading off exploration (searching in less explored areas) and exploitation (searching in promising areas). Common acquisition functions include Expected Improvement (EI), Probability of Improvement (PI), and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB).

3. **Bayes Theorem:** This theorem is fundamental to Bayesian methods, allowing the surrogate model to update its beliefs about the objective function as new data points are evaluated.

## Gaussian Processes

A Gaussian Process (GP) is a collection of random variables, any finite number of which have a joint [Gaussian distribution](../g/gaussian_distribution.md). In the context of Bayesian Optimization, GPs are favored because they can provide not only predictions of the function values at unsampled points but also quantify the uncertainty of these predictions. The GP is defined by a mean function, typically assumed to be zero, and a covariance function (or kernel), which determines the smoothness and other properties of the function.

### Key Concepts in GPs:

1. **Kernel Function:** Determines the similarity between points in the input space. Common choices include the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, the Matérn kernel, and the Polynomial kernel.
2. **Mean Function:** Provides the expected value of the function. Often assumed to be zero for simplicity.
3. **Posterior Distribution:** Given prior information and observed data, the posterior distribution provides an updated probabilistic prediction of the objective function.
4. **Marginal Likelihood:** Used for hyperparameter optimization within the Gaussian Process.

## Acquisition Functions

The acquisition function guides the search for the optimum by suggesting the next point to evaluate. It balances the trade-off between exploration and exploitation.

### Types of Acquisition Functions:

1. **Expected Improvement (EI):** Calculates the expected improvement over the current best observation.
2. **Probability of Improvement (PI):** Measures the probability that a new observation will improve upon the current best value.
3. **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB):** Considers the trade-off between the predicted mean and the uncertainty of the function.

## Bayesian Optimization Process

The iterative process of Bayesian Optimization involves:

1. **Initialization:** Start with an initial set of observations, often chosen via Latin Hypercube Sampling or simple random sampling.
2. **Surrogate Model Fitting:** Fit the surrogate model, such as the GP, to the current observations.
3. **Acquisition Function Optimization:** Optimize the acquisition function to determine the next point for evaluation.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the objective function at the suggested point and update the observation dataset.

This process repeats until a stopping criterion is met, such as a maximum number of evaluations or convergence within a predefined threshold.

## Applications

Bayesian Optimization has found applications in diverse domains due to its efficiency in optimizing expensive and noisy objective functions:

### Hyperparameter Tuning

In machine learning, Bayesian Optimization is often used for hyperparameter tuning, where the objective function is the performance of a machine learning model, and the evaluations are the results of training the model with different hyperparameter settings.

### Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)

AutoML frameworks employ Bayesian Optimization to automate the selection and tuning of machine learning models, leading to faster and more reliable deployment of machine learning solutions.

### Reinforcement Learning

Bayesian Optimization aids in optimizing policy parameters in reinforcement learning, striking a balance between exploring new policies and exploiting known good policies.

### Industrial and Scientific Applications

In engineering and scientific research, Bayesian Optimization is used to optimize experimental settings, such as in material science for finding optimal material compositions.

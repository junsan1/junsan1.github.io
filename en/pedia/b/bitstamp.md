# Bitstamp

Bitstamp is one of the most established cryptocurrency exchanges globally, being in operation since 2011. Founded by Nejc Kodrič and Damijan Merlak, Bitstamp has aimed to provide a reliable and secure platform for buying and selling digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others. The company is headquartered in Luxembourg and has offices in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Slovenia.

## History and Founding

Bitstamp was founded as a European-focused alternative to the then-dominant Mt.Gox exchange following a series of scandals and reliability issues surrounding Mt.Gox. At its inception, Bitstamp sought to create a transparent and secure trading environment for digital currencies.

Initially, the company was founded in Slovenia, but it later moved its registration to the United Kingdom in 2013. Recognizing the need for a more favorable regulatory climate as well as better banking relationships, Bitstamp relocated to Luxembourg in 2016, acquiring a license to operate as a fully regulated payment institution.

## Regulatory Compliance

Bitstamp is known for its rigorous adherence to regulatory standards. The company was one of the first exchanges to gain licenses and adhere to anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations. It has worked closely with financial regulators in different jurisdictions to ensure compliance:

- **Luxembourg**: Bitstamp holds a payment institution license, ensuring adherence to stringent financial regulations.
- **United States**: It is registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as a Money Services Business (MSB).

The regulatory framework surrounding Bitstamp contributes significantly to its reputation as a safe and reliable exchange for both retail and institutional investors.

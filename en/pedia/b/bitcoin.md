# Bitcoin

Bitcoin is a decentralized [digital currency](../d/digital_currency.md) that was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. It was released as [open](../o/open.md)-source software in 2009. Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as [mining](../m/mining.md). They can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services. As of February 2021, over 18.6 million bitcoins were in circulation with a total [market value](../m/market_value.md) of around $1 trillion.

## History and Creation

Bitcoin was invented by an unknown person or group of people under the name Satoshi Nakamoto and was released as [open](../o/open.md)-source software in 2009. The protocol and software were released by Nakamoto in 2009. The identity of Nakamoto remains unknown. In the Bitcoin whitepaper titled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System," Nakamoto proposed an electronic [payment](../p/payment.md) system based on cryptographic proof instead of [trust](../t/trust.md), allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted [third party](../t/third_party.md).

## How Bitcoin Works

Bitcoin is based on a decentralized ledger called a [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md). A [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) is a chain of blocks, where each block contains a set of transactions. These transactions are timestamped into a block and are linked to the previous block through a cryptographic [hash](../h/hash.md), forming a chain. This structure ensures that once a block is added to the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md), it cannot be altered retroactively without altering every subsequent block, which requires consensus from the network majority.

### Blockchain Technology

The [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) is maintained by a network of nodes. Each node stores a copy of the entire [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md), which is continuously updated as new transactions are processed. Nodes validate transactions and add them to the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) in a decentralized manner. Consensus among nodes is achieved through a process called [mining](../m/mining.md).

### Mining

[Mining](../m/mining.md) is the process of adding new transactions to the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) and securing the network. Miners compete to solve complex cryptographic puzzles, and the first one to solve the puzzle gets to add the next block to the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md). In [return](../r/return.md) for their efforts, miners are rewarded with newly created bitcoins and [transaction fees](../t/transaction_fees.md). This reward mechanism ensures that new bitcoins are introduced at a controlled and predictable rate.

### Cryptographic Encryption

Bitcoin transactions are secured using cryptographic encryption. Each user has a pair of cryptographic keys: a public key and a private key. The public key acts as an address to which other users can send bitcoins, while the private key is used to sign transactions and authorize the movement of funds. Cryptographic principles ensure that funds can only be spent by their rightful owners and that the [transaction](../t/transaction.md) history is immutable.

## Bitcoin Transactions

Bitcoin transactions involve transferring ownership of bitcoins from one user to another. Each [transaction](../t/transaction.md) consists of inputs (which are the source of the bitcoins being transferred) and outputs (the destination addresses). Transactions are broadcasted to the network and confirmed by miners. Once a [transaction](../t/transaction.md) is confirmed and added to a block, it becomes part of the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) and cannot be reversed.

### Transaction Fees

[Transaction fees](../t/transaction_fees.md) are paid to miners as an incentive to include transactions in the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md). The [fee](../f/fee.md) amount can vary depending on the network's congestion and the desired confirmation speed. Users can specify the [fee](../f/fee.md) they are willing to pay when creating a [transaction](../t/transaction.md), and higher fees typically result in faster confirmations.

### Confirmation and Security

A [transaction](../t/transaction.md) is considered secure once it has received a certain number of confirmations. Each confirmation represents the addition of a new block to the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md), further securing the [transaction](../t/transaction.md). Typically, six confirmations are considered sufficient for most transactions.

## Bitcoin Ecosystem

The Bitcoin ecosystem consists of various participants, including miners, exchanges, wallet providers, and merchants. Each participant plays a crucial role in maintaining the network's functionality and [security](../s/security.md).

### Miners

Miners are responsible for validating transactions and securing the network. They invest computational power to solve cryptographic puzzles and are rewarded with newly created bitcoins and [transaction fees](../t/transaction_fees.md).

### Exchanges

Bitcoin exchanges facilitate the buying and selling of bitcoins using traditional currencies. They act as intermediaries, providing [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and [price discovery](../p/price_discovery.md) for the Bitcoin [market](../m/market.md). Prominent exchanges include [Coinbase](../c/coinbase.md) (https://www.[coinbase](../c/coinbase.md).com/), [Binance](../b/binance.md) (https://www.[binance](../b/binance.md).com/), and [Kraken](../k/kraken.md) (https://www.[kraken](../k/kraken.md).com/).

### Wallet Providers

Wallet providers [offer](../o/offer.md) software or hardware solutions for storing and managing bitcoins. Wallets can be hot (connected to the internet) or cold (offline and more secure). Popular wallet providers include Ledger (https://www.ledger.com/), Trezor (https://trezor.io/), and Electrum (https://electrum.org/).

### Merchants

Merchants accept bitcoin as a [payment](../p/payment.md) method for goods and services. By integrating Bitcoin [payment](../p/payment.md) gateways, they can cater to a growing [customer](../c/customer.md) base that prefers using cryptocurrencies. Notable merchants accepting Bitcoin include Overstock (https://www.overstock.com/), Microsoft (https://www.microsoft.com/), and Newegg (https://www.newegg.com/).

## Bitcoin's Impact on Finance

Bitcoin has had a significant impact on the financial [industry](../i/industry.md) by introducing a decentralized and borderless [currency](../c/currency.md) that operates outside traditional banking systems. It has empowered individuals to have full control over their finances without relying on intermediaries. Additionally, it has provided an [alternative investment](../a/alternative_investment.md) option and a [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against traditional [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

### Financial Inclusion

Bitcoin has the potential to improve [financial inclusion](../f/financial_inclusion.md) by providing access to financial services for the [unbanked](../u/unbanked.md) and [underbanked](../u/underbanked.md) populations. People in regions with limited or no access to traditional banking can use Bitcoin to participate in the global [economy](../e/economy.md).

### Investment Opportunities

Bitcoin has become a popular investment [asset](../a/asset.md), often referred to as "digital gold." Investors see it as a [store of value](../s/store_of_value.md) and a [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against [inflation](../i/inflation.md) and economic instability. Its volatile nature also presents opportunities for speculative trading and [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md).

### Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

Bitcoin has paved the way for decentralized [finance](../f/finance.md) (DeFi) platforms, which aim to replicate traditional financial services using [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology. DeFi platforms [offer](../o/offer.md) lending, borrowing, and trading services without the need for intermediaries, relying on [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md) to enforce rules and execute transactions.

## Regulatory Environment

The regulatory environment for Bitcoin varies by country and is continuously evolving. Governments and regulatory bodies are working to create frameworks that address issues such as consumer protection, anti-[money laundering](../m/money_laundering.md) (AML), and tax compliance.

### Government Stance

Some governments have embraced Bitcoin and [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology, seeing potential benefits in innovation and [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md). Others have taken a cautious or restrictive approach, citing concerns over financial stability, illicit activities, and loss of control over [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md).

### Compliance and AML

To address concerns over [money laundering](../m/money_laundering.md) and illicit activities, regulatory bodies have implemented compliance and AML requirements for Bitcoin businesses. These requirements often include Know Your [Customer](../c/customer.md) (KYC) procedures, [transaction](../t/transaction.md) monitoring, and reporting [obligations](../o/obligation.md).

### Taxation

Tax treatment of Bitcoin varies by jurisdiction. In some countries, Bitcoin is considered property and is subject to [capital gains tax](../c/capital_gains_tax.md). Others treat it as [currency](../c/currency.md) or [commodity](../c/commodity.md), each with different tax implications. It is important for individuals and businesses to understand their [local tax](../l/local_tax.md) laws and comply with reporting [obligations](../o/obligation.md).

## Challenges and Criticisms

While Bitcoin has gained widespread adoption and recognition, it faces several challenges and criticisms that need to be addressed for its continued growth and acceptance.

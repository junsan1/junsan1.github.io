# Bonus Depreciation

**Bonus [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md)** is a tax incentive that allows businesses to immediately deduct a large percentage of the cost of eligible assets. This [deduction](../d/deduction.md) can significantly reduce the amount of [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md), thereby lowering the federal [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md) for businesses. This [write-off](../w/write-off.md) mechanism is particularly advantageous for [capital](../c/capital.md)-intensive businesses and startups that need to invest in substantial upfront [capital](../c/capital.md) for equipment, machinery, and technology.

## Background and History

The concept of bonus [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) isn’t entirely new. It has undergone several changes since it was first introduced. The bonus [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) first appeared in the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002, in response to the economic impact of the September 11 attacks. Initially, the bonus [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) allowed businesses to deduct 30% of the cost of new assets. This rate was later increased to 50%, and then to 100% under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017.

## Eligibility Requirements

To qualify for bonus [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md), assets must meet specific criteria:

1. **New and Used Property**: Before the TCJA, only new property was eligible. Post-TCJA, both new and used property qualify, provided it is new to the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) (i.e., it hasn’t been used by the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) before).
2. **Qualified Property**: This includes [tangible personal property](../t/tangible_personal_property.md) with a [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) period of 20 years or less, certain computer software, water [utility](../u/utility.md) property, and qualified improvement property.
3. **Placed in Service**: The [asset](../a/asset.md) must be placed in service within a specific timeframe. The TCJA expanded this period significantly.
4. **Exclusions**: Certain properties like buildings and land improvements typically do not qualify for bonus [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md).

## Changes Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act

The TCJA, signed into law by President Donald Trump in December 2017, made significant modifications to bonus [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md). Here are some of the critical changes:

- **100% [Deduction](../d/deduction.md)**: The TCJA allows for a 100% bonus [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) for qualified property acquired and placed in service between September 27, 2017, and January 1, 2023.
- **Used Property**: As noted earlier, the TCJA expanded what qualifies for bonus [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) to include used as well as new property.
- **Phase-Down**: The 100% bonus [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) is not permanent. It phases down:
  - 80% for property placed in service in 2023,
  - 60% for property placed in service in 2024,
  - 40% for property placed in service in 2025,
  - 20% for property placed in service in 2026.

## Accounting Implications

**Bonus [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md)** affects both [financial accounting](../f/financial_accounting.md) and [tax accounting](../t/tax_accounting.md). Companies need to separately track the timing differences in depreciating assets for tax purposes versus financial reporting purposes. This often results in deferred tax liabilities or assets.

### Financial Reporting

For financial reporting, companies follow GAAP (Generally Accepted [Accounting Principles](../a/accounting_principles.md)) in the United States. GAAP does not allow for the immediate expensing of fixed assets; instead, these assets are depreciated over their useful lives. 

### Tax Accounting

For [tax accounting](../t/tax_accounting.md), the Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Code governs the manner in which [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) is deducted. Bonus [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) allows businesses to front-[load](../l/load.md) their [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md), recognizing a significant portion of the [expense](../e/expense.md) in the first year the [asset](../a/asset.md) is placed in service.

## Strategic Considerations

Bonus [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) can impact a company's financial decisions in numerous ways:

1. **[Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md)**: Immediate expensing of [capital](../c/capital.md) expenditures can improve free [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md).
2. **[Tax Planning](../t/tax_planning.md)**: Helps in managing [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md) and leveraging tax credits more effectively. Businesses may choose to accelerate purchases to benefit from the higher bonus [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) rates.
3. **Investment Decisions**: Encourages investment in new machinery, systems, and technology by lowering the after-tax cost of these investments.
4. **[Balance Sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) Effects**: Increased [asset](../a/asset.md) purchases create higher book values for assets that might lead to higher [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) in successive years in [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md).

## Examples of Eligible Assets

### Machinery and Equipment

Large [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) companies, such as Caterpillar Inc. (https://www.caterpillar.com), often benefit from bonus [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) when they purchase new machinery or production equipment. 

### Technology and Software

Technology companies like Microsoft (https://www.microsoft.com) invest heavily in computer equipment and software, both of which can be immediately expensed under bonus [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) guidelines.

### Qualified Improvement Property

Retail companies, such as Walmart (https://www.walmart.com), often invest in improvements to their stores and [distribution](../d/distribution.md) centers, which can qualify as qualified improvement property under bonus [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md).

## Legislative Outlook

Future legislative changes could either extend, modify or eliminate bonus [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md). [Business](../b/business.md) owners and financial planners need to stay informed about any legislative changes that could impact their [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) strategies.

### Advocacy and Criticism

- **Proponents** argue that bonus [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) stimulates [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) by encouraging businesses to invest in new assets.
- **Critics** argue that it disproportionately benefits large corporations and contributes to the [budget deficit](../b/budget_deficit.md).

## Conclusion

Bonus [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) is a powerful tax strategy that offers substantial benefits for businesses by allowing them to write off a large portion of newly acquired assets immediately. This [provision](../p/provision.md)’s periods and rates have undergone various changes over the years and are subject to future modifications. Businesses aiming to [leverage](../l/leverage.md) bonus [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) should continually monitor legislative shifts and, if necessary, consult with tax professionals to maximize the benefits and comply with all pertinent regulations.

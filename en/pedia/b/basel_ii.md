# Basel II

## Introduction

Basel II is an international banking regulation accord that sets forth [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) guidelines and standards for banks to ensure financial stability and mitigate [risk](../r/risk.md). It was established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), which is based at the [Bank](../b/bank.md) for International Settlements (BIS) in Basel, Switzerland. The primary objective of Basel II is to create a more resilient banking system by aligning the [bank](../b/bank.md)'s [risk](../r/risk.md) exposure with its [capital](../c/capital.md) adequacy requirements.

## Historical Context

Before diving into the specifics of Basel II, it is important to understand the historical context in which it was developed. Basel II is a follow-up to [Basel I](../b/basel_i.md), which was introduced in 1988. [Basel I](../b/basel_i.md) primarily focused on [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) and set minimum [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements based on the [risk-weighted assets](../r/risk-weighted_assets.md) of a [bank](../b/bank.md).

While [Basel I](../b/basel_i.md) laid the groundwork for international banking regulations, it had its limitations. It did not adequately address other types of risks such as [operational risk](../o/operational_risk.md), and its one-size-fits-all approach to [risk](../r/risk.md) measurement did not account for the diversity of banking institutions and their varying [risk profiles](../r/risk_profiles.md).

## The Three Pillars of Basel II

Basel II introduces a more comprehensive framework, structured around three pillars:

1. **Minimum [Capital](../c/capital.md) Requirements (Pillar 1)**: This pillar extends the [scope](../s/scope.md) of the minimum [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements established under [Basel I](../b/basel_i.md). It includes not only [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) but also [market risk](../m/market_risk.md) and [operational risk](../o/operational_risk.md). This ensures that banks [hold](../h/hold.md) adequate [capital](../c/capital.md) against a wider [range](../r/range.md) of potential losses.

2. **Supervisory Review Process (Pillar 2)**: This pillar emphasizes the need for regulatory oversight. It requires banks to have internal processes in place to assess their overall [capital](../c/capital.md) adequacy relative to their [risk](../r/risk.md) profile. Additionally, it encourages regulators to intervene when necessary to ensure that banks maintain sufficient [capital](../c/capital.md).

3. **[Market](../m/market.md) Discipline (Pillar 3)**: This pillar aims to enhance [transparency](../t/transparency.md) in the banking [industry](../i/industry.md). By requiring banks to disclose their [risk](../r/risk.md) exposure, [capital](../c/capital.md) adequacy, and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices, it enables [market](../m/market.md) participants to make more informed decisions. This, in turn, promotes more prudent [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) within banks.

## Pillar 1: Minimum Capital Requirements

### Credit Risk

Under Basel II, [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) is assessed using three different approaches:

1. **Standardized Approach**: This approach uses external [credit](../c/credit.md) ratings from recognized [rating](../r/rating.md) agencies to determine the [risk](../r/risk.md) weights for different types of exposures. Each exposure is assigned a [risk](../r/risk.md) weight based on its [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md), which in turn determines the amount of [capital](../c/capital.md) that must be held against it.

2. **Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) Approach**: This approach allows banks to use their internal [risk assessment models](../r/risk_assessment_models.md) to calculate [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md). There are two variations of the IRB approach:
   - **Foundation IRB (F-IRB)**: Banks estimate the probability of [default](../d/default.md) (PD) for each exposure, while other [risk](../r/risk.md) components like loss given [default](../d/default.md) (LGD) and exposure at [default](../d/default.md) (EAD) are provided by regulators.
   - **Advanced IRB (A-IRB)**: Banks estimate all [risk](../r/risk.md) components, including PD, LGD, and EAD, based on their internal models, subject to regulatory approval.

3. **[Securitization](../s/securitization.md)**: This involves the pooling of various types of [debt](../d/debt.md) (such as mortgages or [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) [debt](../d/debt.md)) and selling them as securities to investors. Basel II sets out specific criteria for the [risk](../r/risk.md)-weighting of securitized exposures, both for the originating [bank](../b/bank.md) and the [investing](../i/investing.md) [bank](../b/bank.md).

### Market Risk

[Market risk](../m/market_risk.md) under Basel II relates to the [risk](../r/risk.md) of losses arising from fluctuations in [market](../m/market.md) prices of trading assets. It includes risks from [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, [equity](../e/equity.md) prices, [foreign exchange](../f/foreign_exchange.md) rates, and [commodity](../c/commodity.md) prices. Banks are required to [hold](../h/hold.md) [capital](../c/capital.md) against their [market risk](../m/market_risk.md) exposure, and they can use either a standardized approach or an internal model approach to measure it.

### Operational Risk

[Operational risk](../o/operational_risk.md) is the [risk](../r/risk.md) of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems, or from external events. Basel II offers three methods for calculating [operational risk](../o/operational_risk.md):

1. **Basic [Indicator](../i/indicator.md) Approach (BIA)**: Banks [hold](../h/hold.md) [capital](../c/capital.md) for [operational risk](../o/operational_risk.md) based on a fixed percentage of their annual [gross income](../g/gross_income.md).
2. **Standardized Approach (TSA)**: Banks divide their activities into different [business](../b/business.md) lines, each assigned a specific percentage (the [beta coefficient](../b/beta_coefficient.md)). [Capital](../c/capital.md) requirements are calculated as the sum of the [beta](../b/beta.md) coefficients multiplied by the [gross income](../g/gross_income.md) for each [business](../b/business.md) line.
3. **Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA)**: Banks use their internal [risk](../r/risk.md) measurement models to calculate required [capital](../c/capital.md) for [operational risk](../o/operational_risk.md), subject to regulatory approval.

## Pillar 2: Supervisory Review Process

The Supervisory Review Process under Basel II is designed to ensure that banks not only meet the minimum [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements but also have [robust](../r/robust.md) internal processes to assess their overall [risk](../r/risk.md) and [capital](../c/capital.md) adequacy.

### Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP)

Banks are required to establish an Internal [Capital](../c/capital.md) Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) that systematically assesses all significant risks they face, including those that are not explicitly covered under Pillar 1, such as [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md) in the banking book and concentration [risk](../r/risk.md). ICAAP should be comprehensive, covering [capital](../c/capital.md) planning, [risk](../r/risk.md) assessment methodologies, and [stress testing](../s/stress_testing.md).

### Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP)

Regulators conduct a Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) to evaluate a [bank](../b/bank.md)’s ICAAP. Through SREP, regulators assess whether banks have adequate [capital](../c/capital.md) to cover their risks and whether their internal processes are sufficient to manage those risks. If necessary, regulators can require banks to [hold](../h/hold.md) additional [capital](../c/capital.md) beyond the minimum requirements, enforce corrective measures, or impose other supervisory actions.

## Pillar 3: Market Discipline

Pillar 3 aims to enhance [market](../m/market.md) discipline by increasing the level of [transparency](../t/transparency.md) in the banking sector. Through improved [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) requirements, [market](../m/market.md) participants [gain](../g/gain.md) access to detailed information on a [bank](../b/bank.md)’s [risk](../r/risk.md) exposures, [capital](../c/capital.md) adequacy, and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices. This enables stakeholders to make more informed decisions, which in turn encourages banks to adopt sound [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices.

### Disclosure Requirements

Basel II sets out specific [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) requirements for banks, including:

1. **[Capital Structure](../c/capital_structure.md)**: Information on the composition of regulatory [capital](../c/capital.md), including Tier 1 and [Tier 2 capital](../t/tier_2_capital.md).
2. **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Exposure**: Detailed information on [risk](../r/risk.md) exposures, including [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md), [market risk](../m/market_risk.md), [operational risk](../o/operational_risk.md), and other material risks.
3. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md) Practices**: Descriptions of the [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) processes and methodologies employed by the [bank](../b/bank.md).
4. **[Capital](../c/capital.md) Adequacy**: Quantitative data on the [bank](../b/bank.md)’s [capital](../c/capital.md) adequacy ratios and regulatory [capital](../c/capital.md) buffers.
5. **[Securitization](../s/securitization.md)**: Information on exposures to [securitization](../s/securitization.md), including details on the types of securitized assets and the [risk](../r/risk.md)-weighting applied.

## Implementation and Impact

The implementation of Basel II was phased over several years, with various milestones and deadlines set for its adoption. The accord was initially published in 2004, and many jurisdictions began adopting its guidelines soon after. However, the global [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) of 2007-2008 highlighted some shortcomings in the framework, particularly related to [risk](../r/risk.md) measurement and management practices.

### Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2008

The global [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) exposed significant weaknesses in the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md), including excessive [leverage](../l/leverage.md), inadequate [capital](../c/capital.md) buffers, and poor [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices. It underscored the need for more stringent regulatory oversight and highlighted the importance of having [robust](../r/robust.md) [capital](../c/capital.md) and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) provisions.

### Revisions and Basel III

In response to the lessons learned from the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md), the Basel Committee introduced [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md), which builds upon and strengthens the existing Basel II framework. [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md) incorporates more stringent [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements, introduces new [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) standards, and enhances the [risk](../r/risk.md) coverage of [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements. Key elements of [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md) include higher minimum [capital](../c/capital.md) ratios, a [leverage ratio](../l/leverage_ratio.md), two [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) standards ([Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) [Coverage Ratio](../c/coverage_ratio.md) and Net Stable Funding Ratio), and additional [capital](../c/capital.md) buffers (such as the countercyclical buffer).

### Basel II and the Financial Industry

Basel II has had a profound impact on the financial [industry](../i/industry.md), influencing how banks manage their [risk](../r/risk.md) and [capital](../c/capital.md) adequacy. The framework has encouraged the development of more sophisticated [risk assessment models](../r/risk_assessment_models.md) and advanced [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices. It has also led to increased [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md), promoting greater confidence among [market](../m/market.md) participants.

## Challenges and Criticisms

Despite its contributions to enhancing the stability of the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md), Basel II has faced several challenges and criticisms:

### Complexity and Implementation Costs

Basel II is more complex than its predecessor, requiring significant investment in systems, processes, and human resources. Smaller banks, in particular, may find the costs of implementing advanced approaches (such as IRB and AMA) prohibitive.

### Regulatory Arbitrage

The flexibility in [risk](../r/risk.md) assessment approaches can create opportunities for regulatory [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), where banks choose the most favorable approach to minimize their [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements. This can undermine the objective of ensuring adequate [capital](../c/capital.md) levels across the [industry](../i/industry.md).

### Procyclicality

Basel II’s reliance on [risk](../r/risk.md)-sensitive [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements can introduce procyclicality into the banking system. During economic upswings, banks may [hold](../h/hold.md) less [capital](../c/capital.md) due to lower perceived [risk](../r/risk.md), while during downturns, increased [risk](../r/risk.md) perceptions can lead to higher [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements, exacerbating financial strain.

### Data and Model Risk

The accuracy of internal [risk models](../r/risk_models_in_trading.md) depends on the quality of data and the assumptions used. Inadequate data or flawed models can result in inaccurate [risk](../r/risk.md) assessments and insufficient [capital](../c/capital.md) buffers.

## Conclusion

Basel II represents a significant milestone in the development of international banking regulations, providing a comprehensive framework for [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) and [capital](../c/capital.md) adequacy. By addressing [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md), [market risk](../m/market_risk.md), and [operational risk](../o/operational_risk.md), and promoting [robust](../r/robust.md) supervisory review and [market](../m/market.md) discipline, Basel II has contributed to a more resilient banking system.

However, the framework is not without its challenges and limitations. The global [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) of 2007-2008 underscored the need for further reforms, leading to the development of [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md). As the financial [industry](../i/industry.md) continues to evolve, regulatory frameworks like Basel II and [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md) [will](../w/will.md) play a crucial role in maintaining financial stability and promoting prudent [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices.

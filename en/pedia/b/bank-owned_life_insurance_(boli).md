# Bank-Owned Life Insurance (BOLI)

[Bank](../b/bank.md)-Owned [Life Insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) (BOLI) is a form of [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policy that banks purchase on their executives, employees, and directors. Unlike personal [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policies, where individuals are beneficiaries, in BOLI, the [bank](../b/bank.md) itself is the [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md). This unique structure allows banks to manage costs associated with employee benefits, retirement plans, and executive compensation while benefiting from several financial advantages.

## What is Bank-Owned Life Insurance (BOLI)?

BOLI involves a two-part [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md)—a [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policy on a [bank](../b/bank.md) employee, and an investment component that accumulates cash [value](../v/value.md) over time. When a [bank](../b/bank.md) buys a BOLI policy, it becomes both the owner and the [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md). The [bank](../b/bank.md) pays the premiums and, in [return](../r/return.md), the policy accumulates cash [value](../v/value.md) that can grow over time on a [tax-deferred](../t/tax_deferred.md) [basis](../b/basis.md). The eventual [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) is also [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md), providing substantial financial benefits to the [bank](../b/bank.md).

### Types of BOLI Policies

There are mainly three types of BOLI policies:

1. **[General Account](../g/general_account.md) BOLI**: This type involves the [bank](../b/bank.md) purchasing [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policies where the premiums are placed in the insurer's [general account](../g/general_account.md). The [bank](../b/bank.md) relies on the financial strength and [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) of the insurer.
   
2. **Separate Account BOLI**: Here, the premiums are placed in a separate account managed by the insurer but segregated from its general assets, reducing the institution's exposure to the insurer's [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md).
   
3. **Hybrid Account BOLI**: This combines elements of both general and separate accounts, providing banks with additional flexibility in managing [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) and investment returns.

### Benefits of BOLI

BOLI provides several advantages for banks:

1. **Tax Advantages**: Premiums paid into BOLI policies grow [tax-deferred](../t/tax_deferred.md), and the death benefits are [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md). This provides a significant reduction in tax liabilities for banks.
   
2. **[Asset](../a/asset.md) Growth**: The policies can generate higher yields compared to traditional investments due to their tax advantages, enhancing the [bank](../b/bank.md)'s overall [asset](../a/asset.md) growth.
   
3. **Employee Benefits Funding**: The cash [value](../v/value.md) accumulated in BOLI policies can be used to [offset](../o/offset.md) the costs of employee benefits, retirement plans, and compensation packages.
   
4. **[Balance Sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) Management**: BOLI adds cash [value](../v/value.md) as an [asset](../a/asset.md) while the premiums and policy loans add to the [bank](../b/bank.md)'s liabilities, helping manage the [bank](../b/bank.md)'s [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) more effectively.

### Risks and Considerations

While BOLI presents several benefits, it also entails certain risks:

1. **[Credit Risk](../c/credit_risk.md)**: Especially with [general account](../g/general_account.md) BOLI, the [bank](../b/bank.md) is exposed to the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) company's [financial health](../f/financial_health.md). A decline in the insurer's [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) can impact the [bank](../b/bank.md)'s investment.
   
2. **[Interest Rate Risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md)**: The policy's cash [value](../v/value.md) is dependent on prevailing [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. Changes in rates can affect the returns on the investment component.
   
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Banks need to comply with regulatory requirements to ensure they remain within legal frameworks while utilizing BOLI policies.

## Regulatory and Legal Aspects

Banks must adhere to several regulatory and legal guidelines when [investing](../i/investing.md) in BOLI. Regulatory bodies like the FDIC (Federal [Deposit](../d/deposit.md) [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) [Corporation](../c/corporation.md)) and OCC (Office of the Comptroller of the [Currency](../c/currency.md)) provide specific guidelines for the management of BOLI investments. These include [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md) in assessing the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) provider's [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md), ensuring the [bank](../b/bank.md)'s participation does not exceed certain limits of [Tier 1 capital](../t/tier_1_capital.md), and maintaining accurate records and documentation.

### Regulatory Guidelines

- **FDIC Guidelines**: The FDIC addresses the risks associated with BOLI and provides advisory guidelines, as found in the FDIC's Financial Institution Letter (FIL-127-2004). Banks are advised to perform rigorous [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md), ensure appropriate [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices, and adhere to concentration limits.
  
- **OCC Requirements**: The OCC's bulletin 2004-56 outlines the regulatory expectations for BOLI investments, emphasizing the importance of [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), legal compliance, and the role of the board in overseeing these investments.

### Due Diligence Process

Banks are required to perform comprehensive [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md) before [investing](../i/investing.md) in BOLI. This includes:

1. **Analyzing [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) Providers**: Banks should assess the financial stability, [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md), and track record of [insurance](../i/insurance.md) providers.
   
2. **Understanding Policy Terms**: Thoroughly reviewing policy terms, conditions, and [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md).
   
3. **Establishing Limits**: Setting internal limits on BOLI investments in relation to the [bank](../b/bank.md)’s [capital](../c/capital.md) and [financial health](../f/financial_health.md).
   
4. **Ongoing Monitoring**: Continuously monitoring the performance and [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) associated with BOLI policies and keeping abreast of regulatory changes.

## Implementation and Strategic Use

Implementing a BOLI strategy requires careful planning and involves several strategic steps. Banks typically follow a structured approach to ensure they maximize benefits while managing risks.

### Planning and Design

1. **Identify Objectives**: Banks should clearly define their objectives for [investing](../i/investing.md) in BOLI. Common objectives include funding employee benefits and enhancing [asset](../a/asset.md) growth.
   
2. **Policy Selection**: Choose the type of BOLI policy that aligns with the [bank](../b/bank.md)’s [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md), financial goals, and [credit](../c/credit.md) considerations.
   
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure the BOLI program adheres to all relevant regulatory requirements and maintains [transparency](../t/transparency.md) with regulatory bodies.

### Process of Implementation

1. **Internal Approval**: [Gain](../g/gain.md) approval from the board and senior management by presenting a comprehensive plan outlining the benefits, risks, and compliance measures related to BOLI.
   
2. **Policy Purchase**: Work with [insurance](../i/insurance.md) providers to purchase the chosen BOLI policies, negotiating terms to maximize benefits for the [bank](../b/bank.md).
   
3. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Implement [robust](../r/robust.md) [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices, including regular assessments of the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) provider’s [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and policy performance.

### Strategic Use

Banks can strategically utilize BOLI for various purposes:

1. **Employee Retention**: Use BOLI policies to enhance executive compensation packages, thereby improving retention rates for key personnel.
   
2. **[Capital](../c/capital.md) [Optimization](../o/optimization.md)**: [Leverage](../l/leverage.md) the cash [value](../v/value.md) from BOLI policies to optimize the [bank](../b/bank.md)’s [capital structure](../c/capital_structure.md) and improve [return on assets](../r/return_on_assets_(roa).md) (ROA).

3. **Tax [Efficiency](../e/efficiency.md)**: Utilize the [tax-advantaged](../t/tax-advantaged.md) growth of BOLI policies to enhance overall tax [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and improve net returns.

## Examples of BOLI in Practice

Many banks, from regional institutions to large national banks, employ BOLI as part of their financial and strategic planning. Some examples include:

1. **Wells Fargo**: Wells Fargo, one of the leading banks in the United States, extensively uses BOLI to manage employee benefits and enhance tax [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md). [Wells Fargo](https://www.wellsfargo.com).

2. **[Bank](../b/bank.md) of America**: [Bank](../b/bank.md) of America leverages BOLI policies to [offset](../o/offset.md) costs associated with employee benefits and to support its long-term financial strategies. [Bank of America](https://www.bankofamerica.com).

3. **Community Banks**: Smaller community banks also use BOLI to optimize [capital](../c/capital.md) and manage benefits. For example, First [National Bank](../n/national_bank.md) of Omaha has incorporated BOLI into its strategy to support financial growth and stability.

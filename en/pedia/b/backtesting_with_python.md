# Backtesting with Python

[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) is a critical concept in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). It involves testing a trading strategy on historical data to evaluate its performance. By simulating the strategy on past data, traders can get a sense of how the strategy might perform in real-world trading scenarios without risking actual capital.

Python has become one of the go-to languages for [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) due to its extensive libraries and frameworks tailored for financial analysis and trading automation. Below, we delve into the essentials of [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) using Python, including key libraries, concepts, and a sample implementation.

## Basic Concepts in Backtesting

Before we dive into Python specifics, it's important to understand some fundamental concepts of [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md):

- **Historical Data**: Time-series data for the financial instruments you're interested in. This can include price, volume, and other market indicators.
- **Strategy Logic**: The rules and logic that define your trading strategy. This can be based on [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md), statistical models, or other criteria.
- **[Performance Metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md)**: Metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of your strategy. Common metrics include Net Profit, Return on Investment (ROI), [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md), Maximum Drawdown, etc.
- **Transaction Costs**: Consideration of fees, spreads, and slippage that occur during real trading.

## Basic Steps to Implement a Backtesting Strategy

Here's a simplified workflow for [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) a trading strategy in Python:

1. **Data Acquisition**: Acquire historical data for the asset you want to backtest.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare the data by cleaning and transforming it as needed.
3. **Define the Strategy**: Implement the trading logic.
4. **Run Backtest**: Apply the strategy to historical data.
5. **Evaluate Performance**: Analyze the results using [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md).
6. **Optimization and Validation**: Tweak and optimize the strategy, then validate it to avoid overfitting.

### Example: A Simple Moving Average Crossover Strategy

Below is an example of implementing a simple moving average crossover strategy using [Backtrader](../b/backtrader.md):

```python
import [backtrader](../b/backtrader.md) as bt
import datetime

# Create a Strategy
class SmaCross(bt.SignalStrategy):
    def __init__(self):
        sma1, sma2 = bt.ind.SMA(period=10), bt.ind.SMA(period=30)
        crossover = bt.ind.CrossOver(sma1, sma2)
        self.signal_add(bt.SIGNAL_LONG, crossover)

# Init Cerebro
cerebro = bt.Cerebro()
cerebro.addstrategy(SmaCross)

# Data Feed
data = bt.feeds.YahooFinanceData(dataname='AAPL',
                                 fromdate=datetime.datetime(2015, 1, 1),
                                 todate=datetime.datetime(2020, 12, 31))
cerebro.adddata(data)

# Set Cash
cerebro.broker.setcash(10000)

# Run and Plot
print('Starting Portfolio Value: %.2f' % cerebro.broker.getvalue())
cerebro.run()
print('Ending Portfolio Value: %.2f' % cerebro.broker.getvalue())
cerebro.plot()
```

In this example:
- We define a strategy (`SmaCross`) that enters a long position when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average.
- We initialize the `cerebro` engine and add our strategy.
- We add a data feed from [Yahoo Finance](../y/yahoo_finance.md) for Apple (AAPL) stock.
- We set an initial capital amount.
- We run the backtest and plot the results.

## Performance Metrics

Analyzing [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md) is crucial for understanding how well a strategy might perform in live trading. Here are some commonly used metrics:

### 1. Net Profit

Net profit is the difference between total gains and total losses.

```python
total_cash = cerebro.broker.getvalue()
initial_cash = 10000
net_profit = total_cash - initial_cash
print('Net Profit: %.2f' % net_profit)
```

### 2. Return on Investment (ROI)

ROI measures the profitability of an investment compared to its initial cost.

```python
roi = (total_cash / initial_cash - 1) * 100
print('ROI: %.2f%%' % roi)
```

### 3. Sharpe Ratio

[Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) assesses the [risk-adjusted return](../r/risk-adjusted_return.md) of an investment.

```python
returns = [original-value - new-value for original-value, new-value in zip(original_values, new_values)]
sharpe_ratio = np.mean(returns) / np.std(returns) * np.sqrt(252) # assuming daily returns
print('[Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md): %.2f' % sharpe_ratio)
```

### 4. Maximum Drawdown

Maximum Drawdown measures the largest peak-to-trough decline in the portfolio.

```python
def max_drawdown(equity_curve):
    i = np.argmax(np.maximum.accumulate(equity_curve) - equity_curve)
    j = np.argmax(equity_curve[:i])
    return (equity_curve[j] - equity_curve[i]) / equity_curve[j]

equity_curve = np.array([val.portfolio_value for val in cerebro.run()])
max_dd = max_drawdown(equity_curve)
print('Max Drawdown: %.2f%%' % (max_dd * 100))
```

## Common Pitfalls in Backtesting

While [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) can provide valuable insights, there are common pitfalls you should be aware of:

### 1. Look-Ahead Bias

This occurs when future data is used accidentally in your strategy. Ensuring that decisions are made only on data available up to that point in time is crucial.

### 2. Overfitting

Overfitting happens when a strategy is too closely tailored to historical data, leading to poor performance in live trading.

### 3. Survivorship Bias

[Survivorship bias](../s/survivorship_bias.md) happens when historical data only considers assets that have survived until the present, ignoring those that have failed.

### 4. Ignoring Slippage and Transaction Costs

Ignoring these can overestimate the performance of your strategy, as real-world trading involves deductions due to these factors.

## Advanced Topics

### Walk-Forward Analysis

Walk-forward analysis involves partitioning your data into training and testing sets in a way that mimics rolling forward in time. This technique helps in optimizing and validating your strategy.

### Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning allows strategies to adapt dynamically by learning from their performance. Libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch can be integrated with [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) frameworks to develop AI-driven [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md).

### Genetic Algorithms

Genetic algorithms can help optimize [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) by simulating the process of natural selection, iterating through potential solutions to find the most effective strategy parameters.

## Conclusion

[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) is an indispensable tool in the arsenal of any algorithmic trader. Python offers a variety of libraries and tools that simplify the process of developing, testing, and optimizing [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). While [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) provides valuable insights, it is crucial to be aware of common pitfalls and limitations to make the most of this practice.

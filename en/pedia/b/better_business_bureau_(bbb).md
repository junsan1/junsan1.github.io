# Better Business Bureau (BBB)

The Better [Business](../b/business.md) Bureau (BBB) is a private, non-[profit](../p/profit.md) organization that provides consumer protection and [business](../b/business.md) accreditation services. Established in 1912, the BBB aims to promote ethical [business](../b/business.md) practices and improve [trust](../t/trust.md) between businesses and consumers. It operates mainly in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

## History and Formation

The BBB was founded in 1912 by a group of [business](../b/business.md) leaders who were concerned about false advertising practices. The objective was to create an organization that could help the public distinguish between honest and dishonest [business](../b/business.md) practices. Over the years, the BBB has evolved to include a wide [range](../r/range.md) of services, including dispute resolution, consumer education, and [business](../b/business.md) accreditation.

## Mission and Vision

The BBB’s mission is to advance marketplace [trust](../t/trust.md). This is accomplished by:

1. Setting standards for marketplace [trust](../t/trust.md).
2. Encouraging and supporting [best practices](../b/best_practices.md) by engaging with and educating consumers and businesses.
3. Celebrating marketplace role models.
4. Calling out and addressing substandard marketplace behavior.
5. Creating a community of trustworthy businesses and charities.

The vision of the BBB is to create an ethical marketplace where buyers and sellers can [trust](../t/trust.md) each other.

## Structure and Operations

The BBB operates through a network of independently incorporated local BBB organizations. Each local BBB is tasked with serving its respective local area and addressing issues specific to that region. There is also a national organization, the Council of Better [Business](../b/business.md) Bureaus (CBBB), which provides support and coordination among the local BBBs.

Each local BBB sets its policies, raises its funds, and maintains its own Board of Directors. However, they adhere to the guidelines and standards set by the CBBB.

## Services Offered

### Business Accreditation

One of the primary services offered by the BBB is [business](../b/business.md) accreditation. Accredited businesses must meet specific standards set by the BBB, including a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve consumer complaints. The BBB accreditation is a sign of trustworthiness and helps businesses [gain](../g/gain.md) consumer confidence.

### Dispute Resolution

The BBB offers dispute resolution services to mediate conflicts between consumers and businesses. This service aims to facilitate communication and find a mutual agreement without going through more formal legal procedures.

### Consumer Reviews and Reports

The BBB collects and publishes consumer reviews and reports on businesses and charities. This information is accessible to the public and can help consumers make informed decisions about where to spend their [money](../m/money.md).

### Scam Tracker

The BBB Scam Tracker is an online tool where consumers can report and view scams in their area. This service helps keep the public informed and aware of potential [fraud](../f/fraud.md).

## BBB Rating System

Businesses are rated by the BBB on a scale from A+ to F. This [rating](../r/rating.md) is based on several factors:

1. **[Business](../b/business.md)’s Complaint History with BBB:** The number and severity of complaints filed and the [business](../b/business.md)’s response to those complaints.
2. **Type of [Business](../b/business.md):** Some [business](../b/business.md) types are more prone to complaints, and the BBB considers this in its [rating](../r/rating.md).
3. **Time in [Business](../b/business.md):** More established businesses may be given the benefit of the doubt, while newer ones may have lower initial ratings.
4. **Transparent [Business](../b/business.md) Practices:** This includes [open](../o/open.md) and honest communication with both the BBB and the public.
5. **Failure to Honor Commitments:** If a [business](../b/business.md) fails to honor mediation/[arbitration](../a/arbitration.md) terms or [uphold](../u/uphold.md) commitments made during dispute resolutions.
6. **Licensing and Government Actions:** Compliance with licensing requirements and favorable or unfavorable government actions are also considered.

## Criticisms and Controversies

While the BBB is a widely respected organization, it has faced criticism and controversy over the years. Some of the common criticisms include:

### Pay-to-Play Allegations

There have been allegations that BBB ratings can be influenced by whether or not a [business](../b/business.md) pays for accreditation. Some businesses claim that they received higher ratings after becoming accredited despite facing numerous complaints beforehand.

### Lack of Governmental Oversight

As a private, non-[profit](../p/profit.md) organization, the BBB operates without direct governmental oversight. Critics argue this lack of regulation leaves room for inconsistencies and potential conflicts of [interest](../i/interest.md).

### Variable Standards

Because each local BBB operates independently, there may be variation in how ratings and accreditations are handled across different regions, leading to inconsistencies in service and fairness.

## Impact and Importance

Despite criticisms, the BBB plays a significant role in fostering [trust](../t/trust.md) in the marketplace. Its accreditation and [rating](../r/rating.md) system [offer](../o/offer.md) valuable information to consumers looking to make informed decisions. Additionally, its dispute resolution services provide an alternative to costly and time-consuming legal action.

## Cybersecurity and the Digital Age

As businesses and consumers increasingly interact online, the BBB has adapted by [offering](../o/offering.md) digital-focused services. This includes online reviews, digital dispute resolution, and cybersecurity resources aimed at protecting both businesses and consumers in the digital space.

### BBB Online

The BBB's online presence, through its website and digital tools, has aimed to adapt to the changing landscape of e-[commerce](../c/commerce.md) and digital transactions. Consumers can access BBB ratings, file complaints, and research potential scams through the BBB website.

## Conclusion

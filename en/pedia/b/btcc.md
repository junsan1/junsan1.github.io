# BTCC

## Overview

BTCC, formerly known as BTCChina, is one of the oldest and most influential cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. Founded in June 2011 by Bobby Lee, it holds the distinction of being China's first Bitcoin exchange. Despite regulatory pressures and market uncertainties, BTCC has played a pivotal role in the global cryptocurrency ecosystem.

## History

### Founding and Early Years

BTCC was founded by Bobby Lee, a Stanford computer science graduate, alongside his business partner, Xiaoyu Hou.

### Regulatory Challenges

BTCC, like many other cryptocurrency platforms in China, has faced significant regulatory challenges.

### Acquisition and Rebranding

In January 2018, BTCC was acquired by a Hong Kong-based blockchain investment fund. Following the acquisition, the company rebranded itself from BTCChina to BTCC. This move allowed the exchange to reposition itself in the global market, focusing heavily on international growth.

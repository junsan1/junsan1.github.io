# Bearer Share

Bearer [shares](../s/shares.md), sometimes known as bearer stock, are [negotiable instruments](../n/negotiable_instrument.md) giving the owner the rights of ownership in a [corporation](../c/corporation.md), such as dividends, voting rights, and the right to transfer ownership to another person. Unlike registered [shares](../s/shares.md), where ownership is recorded and tracked, bearer [shares](../s/shares.md) possess no registered ownership information, making it impossible to determine the current owner without physical possession of the certificate. This unique characteristic makes bearer [shares](../s/shares.md) attractive for various purposes, including privacy, but also susceptible to misuse for [money laundering](../m/money_laundering.md) and other financial crimes. This article explores bearer [shares](../s/shares.md) in detail, covering their definition, history, legal status, advantages, disadvantages, and recent regulatory changes impacting their use.

## Definition and Characteristics

### Definition

Bearer [shares](../s/shares.md) are [equity](../e/equity.md) securities wholly owned by whoever holds the physical stock certificate. The issuing company neither registers nor maintains a record of the owners of these [shares](../s/shares.md), hence ownership transfers happen without any form of governmental or corporate notification. They are similar to cash in that they are physical documents that can be transferred simply by handing over the certificate.

### Key Characteristics

1. **Ownership**: The person who possesses the physical certificate is recognized as the owner.
2. **Transferability**: Ownership is transferred through the [physical delivery](../p/physical_delivery_in_trading.md) of the last-endorsed certificate.
3. **Anonymity**: Bearer [shares](../s/shares.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) a high degree of anonymity, as the owner's details are not recorded with the issuing company.
4. **Flexibility**: These [shares](../s/shares.md) can easily be transferred without any formalities, making them flexible in certain financial deals.

## Historical Context

Bearer [shares](../s/shares.md) date back to the early days of modern [corporation](../c/corporation.md) law in the 19th century. They were widely used in many jurisdictions as a way to facilitate [trade](../t/trade.md) and investment. Their portability and anonymity made them attractive to investors. However, the lack of [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and potential for misuse led to increasing regulatory scrutiny over time.

### Pre-20th Century

In the 19th century, corporations were emerging as a prominent force in the [business](../b/business.md) world. Bearer [shares](../s/shares.md) facilitated the trading of corporate stock in a way that was straightforward and [liquid](../l/liquid.md). This was an era where [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) mechanisms were still in their infancy, and bearer [shares](../s/shares.md) played a significant role in the [expansion](../e/expansion.md) of the corporate [economy](../e/economy.md).

### 20th Century Developments

Throughout the 20th century, as regulatory environments evolved, so did the use and perception of bearer [shares](../s/shares.md). Countries began enacting more stringent [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) laws, [market](../m/market.md) regulations, and [transparency](../t/transparency.md) measures. Bearer [shares](../s/shares.md) increasingly came under scrutiny due to their potential for facilitating financial crimes such as [tax evasion](../t/tax_evasion.md) and [money laundering](../m/money_laundering.md).

## Legal Status Around the World

The legal status of bearer [shares](../s/shares.md) varies widely by jurisdiction. Some countries have outlawed them entirely, while others allow their issuance under strict regulatory frameworks. Here are some highlights from different regions:

### European Union

Many EU countries have phased out bearer [shares](../s/shares.md) or have implemented automatic conversion to registered [shares](../s/shares.md):

- **Germany**: Germany abolished bearer [shares](../s/shares.md) for new issues in 2009.
- **France**: France transitioned to registered [shares](../s/shares.md) with the "Loi de Modernisation de l'Ã‰conomie" in 2009.
- **United Kingdom**: The UK Companies Act 2006 does not permit the issuance of bearer [shares](../s/shares.md).

### United States

In the United States, bearer [shares](../s/shares.md) are mostly prohibited due to the [Patriot Act](../p/patriot_act.md) and other anti-[money laundering](../m/money_laundering.md) regulations. Companies incorporated in states like Delaware are not allowed to [issue](../i/issue.md) bearer [shares](../s/shares.md).

### Offshore Jurisdictions

Some [offshore](../o/offshore.md) jurisdictions, known for their favorable [business](../b/business.md) environments, still permit bearer [shares](../s/shares.md) but usually under strict conditions:

- **Panama**: Panama has allowed bearer [shares](../s/shares.md) but introduced custodial requirements in 2013.
- **Cayman Islands**: The Cayman Islands phased out bearer [shares](../s/shares.md) in 2016.

## Advantages

### Anonymity

One of the primary advantages of bearer [shares](../s/shares.md) is anonymity. Since ownership is not registered, it offers privacy that registered [shares](../s/shares.md) cannot.

### Ease of Transfer

The simplicity in transferring ownership by merely handing over the physical certificate makes bearer [shares](../s/shares.md) particularly attractive for certain dealings, including privately negotiated transactions.

### Flexibility in Estate Planning

Bearer [shares](../s/shares.md) can be used in [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md) to transfer [wealth](../w/wealth.md) discreetly and effectively, bypassing [probate](../p/probate.md) proceedings in jurisdictions where this is a concern.

## Disadvantages

### Regulatory Scrutiny

Due to their potential misuse, bearer [shares](../s/shares.md) are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny. This makes their issuance and use less attractive in many jurisdictions.

### Risk of Loss

The physical nature of bearer [shares](../s/shares.md) means that if the certificate is lost or destroyed, ownership rights can be lost as well.

### Financial Crime

Bearer [shares](../s/shares.md) are often associated with illicit activities like [money laundering](../m/money_laundering.md), [tax evasion](../t/tax_evasion.md), and [fraud](../f/fraud.md). This negative perception contributes to their declining use and acceptance globally.

### Limited Use

In the modern financial world, the use of bearer [shares](../s/shares.md) is limited, with many jurisdictions phasing them out. This reduces their attractiveness and flexibility.

## Regulatory Changes

### FATF Recommendations

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has recommended stringent measures concerning bearer [shares](../s/shares.md). Countries are urged to take steps such as requiring the immobilization of bearer [shares](../s/shares.md) and the conversion to registered [shares](../s/shares.md) to enhance [transparency](../t/transparency.md).

### OECD Initiatives

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has also moved against bearer [shares](../s/shares.md). It has encouraged member countries to require beneficial ownership information, which significantly reduces the use of bearer [shares](../s/shares.md).

### National Legislations

Many countries have enacted laws that either abolish bearer [shares](../s/shares.md) or impose strict conditionalities for their use. Examples include:

- **Luxembourg**: Enforced the dematerialization of bearer [shares](../s/shares.md) in 2014.
- **Switzerland**: Announced the abolition of bearer [shares](../s/shares.md) in 2019, with companies required to convert existing bearer [shares](../s/shares.md) to registered [shares](../s/shares.md).

## Alternatives to Bearer Shares

Several alternatives provide a balance between privacy and regulatory compliance. Here are some:

### Registered Shares

The most common alternative, registered [shares](../s/shares.md), require the owner's details to be recorded in the issuing company's ledger. This provides [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and reduces the [risk](../r/risk.md) of misuse but eliminates anonymity.

### Nominee Bank Accounts

For those seeking a degree of privacy, nominee [bank](../b/bank.md) accounts [offer](../o/offer.md) a partial solution. These accounts are held by agents on behalf of the owner, providing some anonymity while still complying with regulatory requirements.

### Digital Assets

In some cases, digital assets such as cryptocurrencies provide an alternative for those prioritizing privacy and ease of transfer. However, these too are increasingly subject to regulatory frameworks designed to prevent financial crime.

## Conclusion

Bearer [shares](../s/shares.md), with their historical significance and unique characteristics, are declining in modern financial systems due to increased regulatory scrutiny and changing norms around [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and financial crime prevention. While they still [offer](../o/offer.md) advantages like anonymity and ease of transfer, the associated risks and negative perceptions make their use limited and increasingly obsolete. Regulatory bodies continue to push for measures that curtail the potential misuse of bearer [shares](../s/shares.md), aiming for a more transparent and accountable [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) framework globally.

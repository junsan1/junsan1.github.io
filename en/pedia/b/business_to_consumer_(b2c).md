# Business to Consumer (B2C)

**[Business](../b/business.md) to Consumer (B2C)** refers to the process in which businesses sell products or services directly to consumers. This operational model has gained significant traction with the rise of the internet, enabling companies to connect with consumers more directly and efficiently. B2C is a broad term that encompasses various methods and channels through which companies can distribute products or services directly to end-users, bypassing traditional intermediaries like wholesalers or retailers.

## Historical Context

The concept of B2C isn't entirely new. It originated in the traditional brick-and-mortar retail models where businesses would sell goods directly to consumers in physical stores. However, the digital revolution transformed B2C significantly, particularly with the advent of the internet in the 1990s, which paved the way for online shopping.

## Evolution and Emergence of E-commerce

The late 1990s and early 2000s saw the emergence of numerous online marketplaces and platforms which redefined B2C [networking](../n/networking.md). Pioneers such as Amazon and eBay laid the groundwork for what became the bustling e-[commerce](../c/commerce.md) ecosystem.

- **Amazon** (https://www.amazon.com) initially started as an online bookstore but quickly diversified, [offering](../o/offering.md) a wide [range](../r/range.md) of products across various categories. Amazon's platform also enabled third-party sellers to reach consumers globally, creating a vast digital marketplace.

- **eBay** (https://www.ebay.com), on the other hand, revolutionized online auctions, allowing individuals and businesses to buy and sell a plethora of goods in a competitive auction format. Today, eBay also supports direct sales, further solidifying its place in the e-[commerce](../c/commerce.md) domain.

## Key Elements of B2C

There are several critical components to the B2C model that ensure its effectiveness and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md):

### User Experience (UX)

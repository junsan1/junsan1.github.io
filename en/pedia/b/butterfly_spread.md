# Butterfly Spread

A butterfly spread is a neutral options trading strategy that involves the simultaneous purchase and sale of multiple options with different strike prices. This strategy is designed to generate a profit when the price of the underlying asset remains within a certain range, and it is popular among traders who expect minimal price movement. The butterfly spread can be implemented using either calls or puts and can be further divided into different variations like long butterfly spread and short butterfly spread. 

## Components of a Butterfly Spread

A standard butterfly spread consists of three legs:
1. Buying one in-the-money (ITM) option.
2. Selling two at-the-money (ATM) options.
3. Buying one out-of-the-money (OTM) option.

### Example

Consider a stock currently trading at $100. A trader could set up a butterfly spread as follows:
- Buy 1 call with a strike price of $95 (ITM)
- Sell 2 calls with a strike price of $100 (ATM)
- Buy 1 call with a strike price of $105 (OTM)

The result is a position where the trader profits the most if the stock closes at the ATM strike price at expiration. Profits diminish as the stock price moves away from the strike price.

## Types of Butterfly Spreads

### Long Butterfly Spread

A long butterfly spread is set up by purchasing a lower strike option, selling two middle strike options, and purchasing a higher strike option. This strategy results in a net debit initially paid out, but offers a high reward-to-risk ratio if the underlying asset's price is around the middle strike price at expiration. 

### Short Butterfly Spread

In contrast, a short butterfly spread involves selling the lower and higher strike options and purchasing twice the middle strike options. This results in a net credit received initially, but the risk can be significant if the underlying asset's price moves significantly.

## Advantages of Butterfly Spreads

1. **Limited Risk:** The maximum loss is limited to the net debit paid to establish the position.
2. **Potential for High Reward:** Given the low cost of entry, the strategy can offer a high reward-to-risk ratio.
3. **Neutral Market Strategy:** Ideal for markets where sideways movement or minimal price change is anticipated.
4. **Flexibility:** Can be applied to various underlying financial instruments including stocks, commodities, and indices.

## Disadvantages of Butterfly Spreads

1. **Limited Profit Range:** The maximum profit is only realized if the underlying asset's price is at the middle strike price at expiration.
2. **Time Decay:** Can work against the position if the underlying asset's price doesn't move as expected.
3. **Complexity:** Requires precise timing and selection of strike prices, which may be complicated for beginner traders.

## Advanced Strategies

### Broken-Wing Butterfly

A broken-wing butterfly spread is a variation in which the width between the strike prices is not equal. This adaptation creates the potential for higher rewards or better control of risk. For instance:
- Buy 1 call with a strike price of $90
- Sell 2 calls with a strike price of $100
- Buy 1 call with a strike price of $110

This can enhance the profitability if properly executed under the right market conditions.

### Iron Butterfly Spread

An iron butterfly involves both calls and puts. It is created by selling an at-the-money straddle (selling an ATM call and an ATM put) and buying an out-of-the-money strangle. The iron butterfly has limited loss and profit potential and mirrors a standard butterfly but is less capital intensive.

## Conclusion

Butterfly spread is a powerful options trading strategy apt for traders anticipating a neutral market. While the strategy capably limits risk and can offer a rewarding payoff if executed meticulously, it requires a deep understanding of the market, precise timing, and choice of strike prices. By leveraging the resources and tools available at reputable trading platforms, traders can enhance their strategies and optimize their potential returns.

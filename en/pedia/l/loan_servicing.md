# Loan Servicing

[Loan](../l/loan.md) servicing refers to the administrative aspects of a [loan](../l/loan.md) from the time the proceeds are dispersed to the borrower until the [loan](../l/loan.md) is paid off. This process is intricate and involves an array of tasks including the collection of payments, sending statements, managing the [escrow](../e/escrow.md) accounts, ensuring the borrower adheres to the [loan](../l/loan.md) terms, and mitigating delinquency. [Loan](../l/loan.md) servicers can be banks, financial institutions, or designated third-party service providers. 

## Key Functions of Loan Servicing

1. **[Payment](../p/payment.md) Processing**: One of the primary functions of [loan](../l/loan.md) servicing is the collection and processing of payments. This involves receiving payments, typically monthly, and applying these payments towards the [principal](../p/principal.md), [interest](../i/interest.md), and any [escrow](../e/escrow.md) accounts for [taxes](../t/taxes.md) and [insurance](../i/insurance.md). Accurate and timely processing is critical to avoid borrower delinquency and maintain the integrity of the [loan](../l/loan.md) servicing process.

2. **[Customer Service](../c/customer_service.md)**: [Loan](../l/loan.md) servicers are the primary contact point for borrowers. They [handle](../h/handle.md) inquiries, provide [loan](../l/loan.md) information, help borrowers manage their accounts, and assist with [loan](../l/loan.md) modifications or [restructuring](../r/restructuring.md) if the borrower faces financial difficulties.

3. **[Escrow](../e/escrow.md) Management**: Many [loan](../l/loan.md) agreements include an [escrow](../e/escrow.md) account for property [taxes](../t/taxes.md) and [insurance](../i/insurance.md) premiums. Servicers gather [escrow](../e/escrow.md) payments from the borrower, manage the account, and disburse funds as needed to pay property [taxes](../t/taxes.md), homeowner's [insurance](../i/insurance.md), and other associated expenses.

4. **Delinquency Management and [Foreclosure](../f/foreclosure.md)**: Managing [delinquent](../d/delinquent.md) accounts is crucial for [loan](../l/loan.md) servicers. They must track late payments, contact the borrower to resolve issues, and, if necessary, initiate [foreclosure](../f/foreclosure.md) proceedings. This involves a detailed understanding of legal processes and requirements.

5. **Reporting and Compliance**: [Loan](../l/loan.md) servicers must keep detailed records of payments, balances, and account histories. They provide regular reports to the [lender](../l/lender.md) and comply with federal and state regulations. Compliance with regulations like the [Real Estate](../r/real_estate.md) Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) and the Fair [Debt](../d/debt.md) Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) is essential.

6. **[Loan](../l/loan.md) Modifications**: In times of financial hardship, borrowers may seek modifications to their [loan](../l/loan.md) terms. [Loan](../l/loan.md) servicers facilitate these modifications, which might include extending the [loan](../l/loan.md) term, reducing the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md), or other adjustments to make payments more manageable for the borrower.

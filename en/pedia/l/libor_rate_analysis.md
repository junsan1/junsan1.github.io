# LIBOR Rate

## Introduction to LIBOR
The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is a globally recognized [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) that represents the average rate at which major global banks are willing to lend to one another in the international [interbank market](../i/interbank_market.md) for short-term loans. It is determined daily and serves as a fundamental reference for a variety of financial instruments and contracts.

## Structure and Calculation of LIBOR
LIBOR is calculated for five currencies: the US dollar (USD), the [euro](../e/euro.md) (EUR), the British pound sterling (GBP), the Japanese yen (JPY), and the Swiss franc (CHF). Furthermore, it takes into account seven different maturities: overnight, one week, and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months. This results in a total of 35 different LIBOR rates being published each [business](../b/business.md) day.

### Determination Process
Each day, a panel of banks submits their estimated [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. These submissions represent the rates at which they believe they could borrow funds from other banks. The rates are then subject to a trimming process: the highest and lowest submissions are excluded, and the remaining rates are averaged to determine the LIBOR for each [currency](../c/currency.md) and [maturity](../m/maturity.md). The Intercontinental [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (ICE) [Benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) Administration currently oversees this process.

## Importance of LIBOR in Financial Markets
LIBOR plays a pivotal role in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) for various reasons:
- **[Benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for Loans and Mortgages:** It is often used as a base rate for adjustable-rate mortgages and other consumer loans.
- **[Derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) and Financial Products:** LIBOR underpins numerous [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) and financial products, including [interest rate swaps](../i/interest_rate_swaps.md), [forward rate](../f/forward_rate.md) agreements, and [futures](../f/futures.md).
- **Corporate Borrowing:** Companies often use LIBOR-related products for short-term borrowing and [hedging interest rate risk](../h/hedging_interest_rate_risk.md).
- **Syndicated Loans:** Large [syndicate](../s/syndicate.md) loans often reference LIBOR for determining [interest](../i/interest.md) payments.

## LIBOR Scandal and Repercussions
In 2012, it was revealed that some banks had manipulated their LIBOR submissions to [profit](../p/profit.md) from trading positions or make themselves appear more creditworthy than they were. This scandal highlighted significant deficiencies in the governance and reliability of LIBOR and led to regulatory overhauls.

### Legal and Financial Impact
The scandal resulted in substantial fines for implicated banks and led to widespread litigation. Furthermore, it prompted calls for more [robust](../r/robust.md) and transparent [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) rates.

## Transition from LIBOR to Alternative Rates
Due to the manipulation issues and the declining number of submissions, there has been a global push to transition away from LIBOR to alternative reference rates. Major economies have developed alternative rates:
- **Secured Overnight [Financing](../f/financing.md) Rate (SOFR):** The preferred alternative in the United States, based on transactions in the Treasury repurchase [market](../m/market.md).
- **Sterling Overnight [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) Average (SONIA):** The UK has adopted SONIA, which is based on actual overnight funding rates in the sterling [market](../m/market.md).
- **[Euro](../e/euro.md) Short-Term Rate (€STR):** The European Central [Bank](../b/bank.md) has introduced €STR as the [eurozone](../e/eurozone.md) alternative.
- **Swiss Average Rate Overnight (SARON):** For the Swiss franc, SARON has been introduced.
- **Tokyo Overnight Average Rate (TONA):** In Japan, TONA is the preferred alternative.

### Transition Timeline and Challenges
Financial institutions face significant challenges in transitioning from LIBOR to new benchmarks:
- **System Integration:** Updating IT systems and financial models to accommodate new rates.
- **Legal Considerations:** Amending and renegotiating contracts that reference LIBOR.
- **[Market](../m/market.md) Adoption:** Ensuring widespread [market](../m/market.md) acceptance and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) for new benchmarks.

## Regulatory Overhaul and Future Outlook
Regulatory bodies, central banks, and financial institutions worldwide are collaborating to ensure a smooth transition from LIBOR. They are also focusing on enhancing the robustness, [transparency](../t/transparency.md), and reliability of alternative rates.

### Ongoing Efforts
- **Guidelines and Frameworks:** Institutions like the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and International Swaps and [Derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) Association (ISDA) are issuing guidelines to aid in the transition.
- **[Market](../m/market.md) Education:** Educating [market](../m/market.md) participants about the features and functionality of alternative rates.
- **Legacy Contracts:** Strategies are being developed to address the challenge of transitioning legacy contracts tied to LIBOR.

## Conclusion
The transition away from LIBOR marks a significant shift in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). As the [industry](../i/industry.md) adapts to new benchmarks, it aims to foster a more transparent and stable financial environment. Stakeholders must stay informed and proactive to navigate this change effectively.

# Level 2 Assets

Level 2 assets are one of the categories used in financial reporting under the fair value hierarchy of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 820 and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 13. These assets are not as easily valued as Level 1 assets, which are typically traded in active markets and have readily available price data. Instead, Level 2 assets require some price modelling due to the less frequent trading or more complex market conditions.

## Characteristics of Level 2 Assets

Level 2 assets hold several distinguishing features:
 
1. **Observable Inputs**: Unlike Level 1 assets, Level 2 assets utilize observable inputs other than quoted prices that are readily available for identical assets. Such observable inputs could include quoted prices for similar assets in active or non-active markets.
2. **Market Activity**: These assets are not traded in high volumes or frequency, making their valuation less transparent compared to Level 1 assets.
3. **Reliance on Models**: Valuation relies on models incorporating observable market data. For instance, the fair value might be derived using the present value of expected future cash flows, with inputs based on observable market data, such as interest rates and yield curves.

## Examples of Level 2 Assets

Examples of Level 2 assets include:
 
1. **Corporate Bonds**: These bonds may not trade daily but have observable data points such as interest rates and credit spreads that can be used in valuation models.
2. **Mortgage-backed Securities (MBS)**: Although these securities do not trade as frequently as more liquid assets, they do have observable inputs like yields and prepayment rates that help in valuation.
3. **Derivatives**: Certain derivatives, like interest rate swaps, fall under Level 2 as their fair values can be determined using models with observable inputs such as interest rate curves.
4. **Equity Positions in Private Companies**: Valuations can be based on market multiples of similar listed companies, adjusted for the differences between the observed inputs and the positions held.

## Valuation Methods for Level 2 Assets

Valuing Level 2 assets necessitates several methods that incorporate observable market data:

1. **Market Approach**: This involves using market transactions for similar or comparable assets.
2. **Income Approach**: This uses models like discounted cash flows (DCF), which project future cash flows and discount them to present value using observable rates.
3. **Cost Approach**: This might be less relevant for Level 2 financial assets but might involve valuing the asset based on the cost of replacement or reproduction.

For example, a corporate bond might be valued using a benchmark yield curve and an adjustment for the bondâ€™s credit spread, both observable in the market.

## Importance in Financial Reporting

Financial reporting relies heavily on the categorization of assets within the fair value hierarchy to give a clear picture of a firm's financial health. Level 2 assets, while less transparent than Level 1, provide crucial balance between observable inputs and inherent uncertainties that Level 3 assets lack. Firms are required to disclose not only the valuations but also the methodologies and inputs used for Level 2 assets, ensuring a transparent overview of their asset valuation processes.

## Regulatory Framework

The valuation and reporting of Level 2 assets are governed by accounting standards and regulatory requirements:

1. **FASB ASC 820**: This standard governs fair value measurements and disclosures in financial statements under U.S. GAAP.
2. **IFRS 13**: Similar to ASC 820, it provides guidelines on fair value measurements under International Financial Reporting Standards.

Both standards aim to ensure consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and provide guidance on inputs, valuation techniques, and necessary disclosures.

## Challenges in Valuation

Valuing Level 2 assets poses several challenges due to the nature of their inputs and market conditions:

1. **Data Reliability**: Ensuring the reliability and relevancy of observable inputs can be difficult, especially in non-active markets.
2. **Market Volatility**: Rapid changes in market conditions can affect the validity of models and assumptions used in valuations.
3. **Complex Modelling Requirements**: Developing and maintaining robust valuation models that depend on various observable inputs require extensive expertise and resources.

## Conclusion

Level 2 assets play a vital role in financial markets and institutions. Their valuation, while more complex than Level 1 assets, strikes a balance by utilizing observable inputs and sophisticated models. Understanding these assets, their valuation methods, and related regulatory frameworks helps in appreciating the nuanced transparency they offer in financial reporting.

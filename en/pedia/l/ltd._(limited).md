# Ltd. (Limited)

## Understanding Ltd. (Limited) Companies

A Limited (Ltd.) company is a type of [business](../b/business.md) structure that offers its owners [limited liability](../l/limited_liability.md), meaning that the personal assets of the company's shareholders are protected against the company's financial liabilities and other [obligations](../o/obligation.md). This type of [business](../b/business.md) entity is common in many countries, providing a clear structure for dividing ownership and protecting individuals from excessive [financial risk](../f/financial_risk.md).

### Characteristics of Ltd. Companies

1. **[Limited Liability](../l/limited_liability.md)**: The primary feature of an Ltd. company is that the [liability](../l/liability.md) of its shareholders is limited to the amount they invested in the company. This means that if the company goes into [debt](../d/debt.md) or faces a lawsuit, shareholders' personal assets are not at [risk](../r/risk.md) beyond their investment in the company.

2. **Separate Legal Entity**: An Ltd. company is considered a separate legal entity from its owners. This enables the company to enter into contracts, own property, sue, and be sued independently of its shareholders, [offering](../o/offering.md) additional protection and continuity.

3. **Shareholders and Structure**: Ltd. companies typically have shareholders who own [shares](../s/shares.md) in the company and are entitled to a portion of the profits. The company's decisions are generally made by a board of directors elected by the shareholders.

4. **Compliance and Regulation**: Ltd. companies are subject to specific compliance and regulatory requirements. This includes registering with the appropriate governmental bodies, maintaining accurate financial records, and filing annual reports.

5. **Perpetual Succession**: The company continues to exist even if the ownership or management changes. This ensures stability and can make it easier for the company to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) and operate continually across different ownership periods.

### Types of Ltd. Companies

There are generally two main types of Ltd. companies:
- **Private Limited Company (Ltd.)**: This is a privately held [business](../b/business.md) entity, and its [shares](../s/shares.md) are not available to the public. The number of shareholders is restricted, often to no more than 50, and there are limitations on the transfer of [shares](../s/shares.md). This structure is suitable for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

- **Public Limited Company (PLC)**: Unlike a private limited company, a PLC can [offer](../o/offer.md) its [shares](../s/shares.md) to the public through a stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md). This structure is typically used by larger companies that seek to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) from a broad [investor](../i/investor.md) base.

### Advantages of Ltd. Companies

1. **Protection from Personal [Liability](../l/liability.md)**: Shareholders' personal assets are safeguarded, which encourages investment and entrepreneurship.

2. **Attracting Investment**: The clear structure and [limited liability](../l/limited_liability.md) make it easier to attract investors who are assured their [risk](../r/risk.md) is limited to their investment.

3. **Tax Benefits**: Ltd. companies may have access to certain tax benefits and deductions that are not available to unincorporated businesses.

4. **Credibility and [Trust](../t/trust.md)**: Being an incorporated entity often lends credibility to a [business](../b/business.md), which can be beneficial when dealing with suppliers, customers, and financial institutions.

### Disadvantages of Ltd. Companies

1. **Regulatory Burden**: Ltd. companies are subject to stringent regulatory requirements, which can entail significant administrative work and costs.

2. **[Transparency](../t/transparency.md)**: Companies must disclose financial and other significant information, which might be accessed by competitors and the public.

3. **Limited Control**: Depending on the number of shareholders and the share structure, original owners might have to share or entirely relinquish control over the company.

### Formation of an Ltd. Company

Forming an Ltd. company typically involves several steps:
1. **Choosing a Name**: The company must have a unique name that does not infringe on existing trademarks.

2. **Registering the Company**: This process varies from country to country but generally involves submitting [incorporation](../i/incorporation.md) documents to the relevant governmental body (e.g., Companies House in the UK or the Secretary of State in the U.S.).

3. **Memorandum and [Articles of Association](../a/articles_of_association.md)**: These documents outline the company's structure, purpose, and how it [will](../w/will.md) be governed.

4. **Appoint Directors and Shareholders**: Initial directors and shareholders must be appointed and documented.

5. **Register for [Taxes](../t/taxes.md) and Licenses**: The company must register for any necessary local, state, and federal [taxes](../t/taxes.md) and obtain required licenses to operate.

### Global Perspectives on Ltd. Companies

#### United Kingdom

In the UK, Ltd. companies must be registered with Companies House. The two primary types are private companies limited by [shares](../s/shares.md) and public limited companies. UK law provides a [robust](../r/robust.md) framework for the operation and regulation of these entities, with clear guidelines on compliance, financial reporting, and [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md).

#### United States

In the U.S., the equivalent of an Ltd. company can be found in the form of Corporations (Inc.) or [Limited Liability](../l/limited_liability.md) Companies (LLCs). These entities provide similar benefits regarding [limited liability](../l/limited_liability.md) but are regulated under state law, which means requirements can vary significantly between states.

#### European Union

Across EU countries, each member state has its own regulations for Ltd. companies, but the general principles of [limited liability](../l/limited_liability.md), separate legal entity status, and regulatory compliance are consistent. The EU also provides frameworks to facilitate cross-border operations and harmonize certain corporate regulations.

### Ltd. Companies in Fintech and Algortrading

#### Fintech

In the rapidly evolving fintech landscape, many innovative startups choose the Ltd. structure due to its advantages in raising [capital](../c/capital.md) while protecting founders' personal assets. The regulatory compliance and structured financial reporting also enhance their credibility with investors.

#### Example: Revolut Ltd.
Revolut is a UK-based fintech company that offers banking services, including [currency exchange](../c/currency_exchange.md), peer-to-peer payments, and physical [bank](../b/bank.md) cards.

#### Algortrading

For companies involved in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), being an Ltd. helps in segregating [business](../b/business.md) and personal liabilities, which is crucial given the high-[risk](../r/risk.md) nature of financial trading. The structure also provides a clear legal entity for entering into contracts and regulatory compliance necessary for operating in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

#### Example: QuantConnect
[QuantConnect](../q/quantconnect.md) is a company that provides a platform for algorithmic traders to design, backtest, and deploy [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

### Conclusion

The Ltd. [business](../b/business.md) structure offers significant advantages for a wide [range](../r/range.md) of companies, from small enterprises to large multinationals. By providing [limited liability](../l/limited_liability.md), a clear legal framework, and enhanced credibility, Ltd. companies are well-suited to various industries, including fintech and [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md). However, the regulatory and administrative requirements mean that businesses must carefully consider their capacity to manage these [obligations](../o/obligation.md) when opting for an Ltd. structure.

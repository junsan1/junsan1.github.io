# Liar Loan

A "Liar [Loan](../l/loan.md)," also known as a "no-doc" or "low-doc" [loan](../l/loan.md), is a category of [home](../h/home.md) [loan](../l/loan.md) that requires little to no documentation from the borrower to verify [income](../i/income.md) and assets. Instead, borrowers are often allowed to state their [income](../i/income.md) and other financial details without providing supporting documents, such as tax returns or pay stubs, which typically verify these claims in standard lending processes. The name "Liar [Loan](../l/loan.md)" derives from the potential for borrowers and sometimes even lenders to falsify information to secure the [loan](../l/loan.md) approval.

## Historical Context and Emergence

Liar Loans became particularly notorious during the early 2000s, specifically contributing to the [housing bubble](../h/housing_bubble.md) and subsequent [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) of 2007-2008. Financial institutions and borrowers found themselves in a dynamic that encouraged the misrepresentation of financial situations, heavily contributing to the [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and eventual collapse of the housing [market](../m/market.md). These loans proliferated as a response to increasing housing [demand](../d/demand.md) and the financial [industry](../i/industry.md)'s push towards generating higher [loan](../l/loan.md) volumes, often disregarding long-term [risk management](../r/risk_management.md).

## Mechanics of Liar Loans

### Application Process

The distinguishing feature of a Liar [Loan](../l/loan.md) is its streamlined application process:

1. **Stated [Income](../i/income.md)**: Borrowers provide an [income](../i/income.md) figure without documentation. The assumption is that they are self-employed or have fluctuating [income](../i/income.md) streams.
2. **No [Income](../i/income.md) Verification**: Unlike traditional loans, there is no requirement for pay stubs, tax returns, or employer verification.
3. **Stated Assets**: Borrowers declare their assets without providing proofs like [bank](../b/bank.md) statements or [asset](../a/asset.md) documentation.
4. **Lax [Underwriting Standards](../u/underwriting_standards.md)**: Financial institutions may conduct minimal vetting, focusing more on boosting [loan](../l/loan.md) approval rates.

### Incentives for Borrowers and Lenders

#### Borrowers:

1. **Ease of Access**: Fast approval without the hassle of gathering extensive documentation.
2. **Appeal to Self-employed**: Useful for individuals with non-traditional [income](../i/income.md) patterns.
3. **Higher [Loan](../l/loan.md) Amounts**: With [income](../i/income.md) less scrutinized, borrowers could obtain higher [loan](../l/loan.md) amounts.

#### Lenders:

1. **Increased [Loan](../l/loan.md) [Volume](../v/volume.md)**: Generates higher sales and potential [profit margins](../p/profit_margins_in_trading.md) from fees and [interest](../i/interest.md).
2. **[Securitization](../s/securitization.md) Opportunities**: Packaging these loans into [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-backed securities for resale in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).
3. **[Market Share](../m/market_share.md) [Expansion](../e/expansion.md)**: Attracts a broader [range](../r/range.md) of borrowers, including those who might not qualify for traditional loans.

## Risks and Consequences

### For Borrowers

1. **Over-[leverage](../l/leverage.md)**: Borrowers might take out larger loans than their financial situation can support, leading to potential defaults.
2. **[Foreclosure](../f/foreclosure.md)**: Without adequate [income](../i/income.md), keeping up with [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) payments becomes challenging, resulting in property loss.
3. **[Credit](../c/credit.md) Damage**: Defaulting on such loans severely affects [credit](../c/credit.md) scores and future borrowing ability.

### For Lenders and Financial Markets

1. **High [Default](../d/default.md) Rates**: The lack of proper vetting leads to higher chances of [loan](../l/loan.md) defaults.
2. **Financial Instability**: The bundling of these risky loans into investment products can permeate through [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), spreading [risk](../r/risk.md).
3. **Regulatory Backlash**: Following the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md), there were numerous calls for tighter regulation, resulting in changes like the Dodd-Frank Act in the United States.

## Regulatory and Market Reactions

Post-crisis, the [financial sector](../f/financial_sector.md) saw substantial regulatory changes aiming to curb the practices that led to the proliferation of Liar Loans:

1. **The [Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act](../d/dodd-frank_wall_street_reform_and_consumer_protection_act.md)**: Enacted in 2010, this act introduced more stringent requirements for [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) lending and recognized the necessity of proper documentation.
2. **[Qualified Mortgage](../q/qualified_mortgage.md) (QM) Rule**: Part of Dodd-Frank, it imposes stricter [underwriting standards](../u/underwriting_standards.md) and requires lenders to verify the borrower's ability to repay the [loan](../l/loan.md).
3. **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)**: Established to oversee and enforce legal regulations, thereby protecting consumers and ensuring [loan](../l/loan.md) practices are fair and transparent.

## Present-Day Scenario

In the contemporary financial landscape, the concept of Liar Loans has largely receded due to increased regulatory oversight and a more cautious approach from lenders. Institutions emphasize verified documentation, and there's a stronger focus on borrowers' ability to repay, reflecting lessons learned from the past [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md). However, certain low-doc or no-[income](../i/income.md)-verification loans still exist but typically under far more stringent criteria and higher [credit score](../c/credit_score.md) requirements.

## Example Companies/Entities

### Citigroup

Citigroup was among the major financial institutions significantly affected during the 2007-2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) due to its involvement in [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-backed securities that included a substantial amount of Liar Loans. Although the company has since restructured and improved its lending standards, it remains a pertinent example of how the financial giants participated in the dynamics that Liar Loans represented.

### Countrywide Financial

Countrywide Financial, once a dominant player in the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [market](../m/market.md), became infamous for its aggressive lending practices, which included a significant number of Liar Loans. Its exposure to unsustainable [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) debts led to its [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) by [Bank](../b/bank.md) of America in 2008.

### Lehman Brothers

[Lehman Brothers](../l/lehman_brothers.md) is now a historical example, as its [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) in 2008 represented one of the largest failures in U.S. financial history. The investment [bank](../b/bank.md) heavily invested in [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-backed securities filled with Liar Loans, leading to its downfall and playing a critical role in the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md).

## Conclusion

Liar Loans serve as a significant illustration of the confluence between [risk](../r/risk.md)-taking behavior in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and inadequate regulatory frameworks. The fallout from the 2007-2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) has reshaped how loans are approached, with lasting impacts on regulatory policies and lending practices. The lessons drawn from the prevalence and consequences of Liar Loans continue to inform financial regulations and [market](../m/market.md) strategies today.

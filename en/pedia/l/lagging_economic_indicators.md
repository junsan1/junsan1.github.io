# Lagging Economic Indicators

Lagging [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md) are quantitative metrics that refer to the economic occurrences happening in a market or an economy after specific trends or patterns have already established. These indicators are thorough metrics, reflecting the past performance and conditions of an economy, making them crucial for verifying and validating previous forecasts and analyses. They tend to be used to confirm long-term trends or a shift in economic activities. Below, we will delve deeply into the various types of lagging [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md), their significance, and their examples.

### Types of Lagging Economic Indicators

1. **Unemployment Rate**
   - **Definition**: The percentage of the labor force that is unemployed but actively seeking employment and willing to work.
   - **Significance**: A high unemployment rate might indicate a lagging economy, whereas lower unemployment rates suggest economic growth.
   - **Example**: The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports monthly unemployment rates.

2. **Consumer Price Index (CPI)**
   - **Definition**: Measures changes in the price level of a basket of consumer goods and services purchased by households.
   - **Significance**: CPI is vital for understanding inflationary trends and the cost of living.
   - **Example**: Detailed CPI data is provided by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).

3. **Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Growth Rate**
   - **Definition**: Represents the market value of all final goods and services produced over a period.
   - **Significance**: While GDP itself is a broad measure, historical GDP growth rates serve as [lagging indicators](../l/lagging_indicators.md) showing economic performance.

5. **Labor Cost per Unit of Output**
   - **Definition**: Reflects the cost of labor required to produce one unit of output.
   - **Significance**: Rising labor costs per unit can indicate decreasing efficiency or growing wage pressures.
   - **Example**: Data on labor costs per unit can be accessed from employment cost indices.

6. **Interest Rates**
   - **Definition**: The amount charged by a lender to a borrower for the use of assets, expressed as a percentage of the principal.
   - **Significance**: Historical interest rate trends can confirm phases of economic contraction or expansion.

7. **Outstanding Loans and Credit**
   - **Definition**: The total sum of loans given by financial institutions which are yet to be repaid.
   - **Significance**: The volume of outstanding loans can indicate consumer and business confidence in economic conditions.

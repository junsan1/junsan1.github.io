# Listed Option

A [listed](../l/listed.md) option is a type of financial [derivative](../d/derivative.md) that is traded on a regulated [exchange](../e/exchange.md), such as the Chicago Board [Options](../o/options.md) [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (CBOE) or the New York Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (NYSE). [Listed](../l/listed.md) [options](../o/options.md) are standardized contracts that [grant](../g/grant.md) the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy ([call option](../c/call_option.md)) or sell ([put option](../p/put.md)) a specific quantity of an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at a predetermined price ([strike price](../s/strike_price.md)) within a set period of time until the contract's [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md). [Listed](../l/listed.md) [options](../o/options.md) are characterized by their [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), [transparency](../t/transparency.md), and standardized terms, making them popular instruments for hedging, [speculation](../s/speculation.md), and [income](../i/income.md) generation.

## Key Features of Listed Options

### Standardization
[Listed](../l/listed.md) [options](../o/options.md) are standardized by the exchanges on which they are traded. This standardization includes the contract size, [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md), and strike prices, ensuring that all traders have a clear understanding of the [options](../o/options.md) they are trading. For example, each [listed](../l/listed.md) option contract typically represents 100 [shares](../s/shares.md) of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock.

### Liquidity
Due to their standardized nature and the participation of a large number of [market](../m/market.md) participants, [listed](../l/listed.md) [options](../o/options.md) tend to be highly [liquid](../l/liquid.md). This means that traders can easily enter and exit positions without significantly affecting the option's price.

### Transparency
[Listed](../l/listed.md) [options](../o/options.md) benefit from the [transparency](../t/transparency.md) provided by the exchanges. This includes access to pricing data, [volume](../v/volume.md) information, and the option's [Greeks](../g/greeks.md), which measure sensitivity to various factors. The availability of this information helps traders make informed decisions.

### Regulation
Trading of [listed](../l/listed.md) [options](../o/options.md) is subject to regulation by authorities such as the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) in the United States. These regulations aim to protect investors by ensuring fair and orderly markets, preventing [fraud](../f/fraud.md), and maintaining [market](../m/market.md) integrity.

## Types of Listed Options

### Call Options
A [call option](../c/call_option.md) gives the holder the right to buy the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at a specific [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) before or on the [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md). Investors purchase calls when they expect the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price to rise.

### Put Options
A [put option](../p/put.md) gives the holder the right to sell the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at a specific [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) before or on the [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md). Investors purchase puts when they expect the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price to fall.

## Uses of Listed Options

### Hedging
[Listed](../l/listed.md) [options](../o/options.md) are widely used for hedging purposes. For example, an [investor](../i/investor.md) who owns a stock can purchase [put options](../p/put_options.md) to protect against a potential decline in the stock's price. This strategy is known as a [protective put](../p/protective_put.md).

### Speculation
Traders often use [listed](../l/listed.md) [options](../o/options.md) to speculate on the future direction of an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price. Due to the [leverage](../l/leverage.md) [options](../o/options.md) provide, a relatively small investment can control a large position in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), magnifying both potential returns and risks.

### Income Generation
[Listed](../l/listed.md) [options](../o/options.md) can also be used to generate [income](../i/income.md) through strategies such as writing covered calls. In this strategy, an [investor](../i/investor.md) who owns [shares](../s/shares.md) of a stock sells call [options](../o/options.md) against those [shares](../s/shares.md), collecting the [option premium](../o/option_premium.md) as [income](../i/income.md).

## Option Pricing Models

The price of a [listed](../l/listed.md) option, known as the [option premium](../o/option_premium.md), is determined by several factors, including the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price, the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md), time to expiration, [volatility](../v/volatility.md), [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, and dividends. Various models, such as the [Black-Scholes model](../b/black-scholes_model.md) and the Binomial model, are used to estimate the [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) of [options](../o/options.md).

### Black-Scholes Model
The [Black-Scholes model](../b/black-scholes_model.md) is a widely used mathematical model for valuing European-style [options](../o/options.md). It was developed by Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and Robert Merton. The model assumes that the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) follows a [geometric Brownian motion](../g/geometric_brownian_motion.md) with constant [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

### Binomial Model
The Binomial model is another popular method for valuing [options](../o/options.md). It uses a discrete-time framework to model the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price movements. The model divides the time to expiration into several periods, with the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s price moving up or down in each period. The option's [value](../v/value.md) is then determined by working backward from the [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md) to the present.

## Example of Listed Option Trading

Consider an [investor](../i/investor.md) bullish on Company XYZ's stock, which is currently trading at $50 per share. The [investor](../i/investor.md) believes the stock [will](../w/will.md) rise to $60 within three months and decides to buy a three-month [call option](../c/call_option.md) with a $55 [strike price](../s/strike_price.md), trading at a [premium](../p/premium.md) of $2.50.

1. **Purchase [Call Option](../c/call_option.md):**
   - [Premium](../p/premium.md) paid: $2.50 per share
   - Contract size: 100 [shares](../s/shares.md)
   - Total cost: $2.50 * 100 = $250

2. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - **Stock Price Rises to $60:**
     - The option's [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md): ($60 - $55) * 100 = $500
     - [Profit](../p/profit.md): $500 - $250 = $250
   - **Stock Price Remains at $50 or Falls:**
     - The [call option](../c/call_option.md) expires worthless.
     - Loss: $250 ([premium](../p/premium.md) paid)

## Important Considerations

### Time Decay
[Options](../o/options.md) are subject to [time decay](../t/time_decay.md), meaning their [value](../v/value.md) decreases as the [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md) approaches, all else being equal. This phenomenon, known as [Theta](../t/theta.md), can significantly impact the profitability of [options trading strategies](../o/options_trading_strategies.md).

### Volatility
[Volatility](../v/volatility.md) is a crucial [factor](../f/factor.md) in [options](../o/options.md) pricing. Higher [volatility](../v/volatility.md) increases the likelihood of the option finishing in-the-[money](../m/money.md), thus raising the [option premium](../o/option_premium.md). Implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md), derived from the option's [market price](../m/market_price.md), reflects the [market](../m/market.md)'s expectations of future [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

### Exercise and Assignment
[Options](../o/options.md) can be exercised at any time before expiration (American-style) or only at expiration (European-style). Writers of [options](../o/options.md) should be aware of the [risk](../r/risk.md) of [assignment](../a/assignment.md), where they may be obligated to fulfill the terms of the contract.

## Conclusion

[Listed](../l/listed.md) [options](../o/options.md) are versatile financial instruments [offering](../o/offering.md) various uses, including hedging, [speculation](../s/speculation.md), and [income](../i/income.md) generation. Their standardized nature, [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), and [transparency](../t/transparency.md) make them accessible and attractive to a wide [range](../r/range.md) of investors and traders. However, [options](../o/options.md) trading carries risks, and a thorough understanding of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) mechanics, pricing models, and [market](../m/market.md) factors is essential for success.

# Long Futures Position

### Introduction
A long [futures](../f/futures.md) position is a critical concept in the realm of financial trading, specifically within the [scope](../s/scope.md) of [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md). This concept involves buying a [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) with the anticipation that the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price [will](../w/will.md) rise in the future. If the price increases, the [value](../v/value.md) of the [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) also rises, leading to potential profits for the [investor](../i/investor.md). This strategy contrasts with a short [futures](../f/futures.md) position, where the [trader](../t/trader.md) expects the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price to decline.

### Futures Contracts
A [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) is a standardized legal agreement to buy or sell an [asset](../a/asset.md) at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future. These contracts are traded on [futures](../f/futures.md) exchanges and can involve a variety of [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets, including commodities, [stocks](../s/stock.md), indices, and currencies. The key elements of a [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) are:
- **[Underlying Asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)**: The specific [commodity](../c/commodity.md) or [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) on which the [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) is based.
- **Contract Size**: The quantity of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) that the contract represents.
- **[Expiration Date](../e/expiration_date.md)**: The date on which the contract expires and the [transaction](../t/transaction.md) must be settled.
- **Settlement Method**: [Futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) can be settled either by [physical delivery](../p/physical_delivery_in_trading.md) of the [asset](../a/asset.md) or cash settlement.

### Mechanics of a Long Futures Position
Taking a long [futures](../f/futures.md) position involves entering into a [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) with the intention of buying the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at a future date and a predetermined price. Here's a step-by-step view of how it works:
1. **Entering the Contract**: The [trader](../t/trader.md) buys the [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md), thereby locking in the price at which they [will](../w/will.md) purchase the [asset](../a/asset.md) in the future.
2. **Price Movements**: If the [market price](../m/market_price.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) increases, the [value](../v/value.md) of the [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) also rises. Conversely, if the [market price](../m/market_price.md) falls, the [value](../v/value.md) of the contract decreases.
3. **[Margin](../m/margin.md) Requirements**: Traders must maintain a [margin account](../m/margin_account.md), which acts as a [security](../s/security.md) [deposit](../d/deposit.md) to ensure they fulfill their contractual [obligations](../o/obligation.md). This [margin](../m/margin.md) consists of an [initial margin](../i/initial_margin.md) (upfront [deposit](../d/deposit.md)) and a [maintenance margin](../m/maintenance_margin.md) (minimum [account balance](../a/account_balance.md)).
4. **Marking to [Market](../m/market.md)**: [Futures](../f/futures.md) accounts are marked to [market](../m/market.md) daily, meaning that gains and losses are calculated and settled each trading day based on the closing [market price](../m/market_price.md).
5. **Closing the Position**: The [trader](../t/trader.md) can close the long position by entering into an offsetting short position or letting the contract reach expiration, at which point the contract is settled by cash or [physical delivery](../p/physical_delivery_in_trading.md).

### Example of a Long Futures Position
Consider a [investor](../i/investor.md) who anticipates that the price of [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md) [will](../w/will.md) increase. They decide to take a long position in [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md) [futures](../f/futures.md):
- **Contract**: [Crude Oil](../c/crude_oil.md) [Futures](../f/futures.md)
- **Contract Size**: 1,000 barrels
- **Price upon Purchase**: $55 per barrel
- **[Expiration Date](../e/expiration_date.md)**: Three months from purchase date

If after two months, the price of [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md) rises to $60 per barrel, the [value](../v/value.md) of the [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) increases proportionally. The [trader](../t/trader.md) can then sell the contract to realize a [profit](../p/profit.md) or [hold](../h/hold.md) it until expiration.

### Advantages of a Long Futures Position
- **[Leverage](../l/leverage.md)**: [Futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) significant [leverage](../l/leverage.md), allowing traders to control large positions with a relatively small amount of [capital](../c/capital.md).
- **Hedging**: Investors who [hold](../h/hold.md) the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) can use long [futures](../f/futures.md) positions to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against potential price increases, thereby reducing their [market risk](../m/market_risk.md).
- **[Speculation](../s/speculation.md)**: [Futures](../f/futures.md) provide opportunities for speculative trading, enabling traders to [profit](../p/profit.md) from anticipated price movements without the need to [hold](../h/hold.md) the actual [asset](../a/asset.md).

### Risks of a Long Futures Position
- **[Market Risk](../m/market_risk.md)**: [Futures](../f/futures.md) trading is inherently risky due to potential price [volatility](../v/volatility.md) in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).
- **[Leverage](../l/leverage.md) [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: While [leverage](../l/leverage.md) can amplify profits, it can also lead to substantial losses, potentially exceeding the [initial margin](../i/initial_margin.md) requirement.
- **[Margin](../m/margin.md) Calls**: If the [value](../v/value.md) of the [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) declines significantly, the [trader](../t/trader.md) may face a [margin call](../m/margin_call.md), requiring an additional [deposit](../d/deposit.md) to maintain the position.
- **[Liquidity Risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md)**: Not all [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) are highly [liquid](../l/liquid.md); illiquid markets can result in wider [bid](../b/bid.md)-ask [spreads](../s/spreads.md) and [slippage](../s/slippage.md), impacting profitability.

### Real-world Applications
Long [futures](../f/futures.md) positions are commonly used by various [market](../m/market.md) participants:
- **Commercial Hedgers**: Businesses, such as airlines, may take long positions in fuel [futures](../f/futures.md) to lock in prices and manage costs.
- **Institutional Investors**: Pension funds and mutual funds may use long [futures](../f/futures.md) to [gain](../g/gain.md) exposure to particular sectors or commodities.
- **Individual Traders**: Retail investors speculate on price movements across a [range](../r/range.md) of [futures](../f/futures.md) markets, including commodities, currencies, and financial indices.

### Conclusion
A long [futures](../f/futures.md) position is a versatile and strategic tool in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), enabling traders and investors to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on anticipated price increases of [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets. While [offering](../o/offering.md) [multiple](../m/multiple.md) benefits, including [leverage](../l/leverage.md) and hedging capabilities, it carries inherent risks that must be carefully managed. Successful [futures](../f/futures.md) trading requires a solid understanding of [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md), careful [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), and the ability to respond quickly to changing [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

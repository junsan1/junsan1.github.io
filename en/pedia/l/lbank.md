### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

### Regular Security Audits

### SSL Encryption

All data transmitted between users and the platform is encrypted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technology. This ensures that sensitive information, such as login credentials and [transaction](../t/transaction.md) details, remains protected from interception by malicious actors.

### Anti-Money Laundering (AML)

LBank has implemented [robust](../r/robust.md) AML procedures to detect and prevent [money laundering](../m/money_laundering.md) and other illicit activities.

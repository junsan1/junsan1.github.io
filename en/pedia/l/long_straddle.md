# Long Straddle

A Long [Straddle](../s/straddle.md) is a sophisticated [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) in [options](../o/options.md) trading. This involves purchasing both a [call option](../c/call_option.md) and a [put option](../p/put.md) on the same [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), with the same [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) and the same [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md). The goal of a Long [Straddle](../s/straddle.md) is to [profit](../p/profit.md) from large price movements in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), regardless of the direction of the move. This strategy is particularly useful when a [trader](../t/trader.md) expects significant [volatility](../v/volatility.md) but is unsure about the direction of the price movement.

## Components of a Long Straddle

1. **[Call Option](../c/call_option.md):** A financial contract that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy a specified amount of an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at a predetermined price ([strike price](../s/strike_price.md)) within a specified period (until the [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md)).
  
2. **[Put Option](../p/put.md):** A financial contract that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to sell a specified amount of an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at a predetermined price ([strike price](../s/strike_price.md)) within a specified period (until the [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md)).

3. **[Strike Price](../s/strike_price.md):** The set price at which the call and [put options](../p/put_options.md) can be exercised.

4. **[Expiration Date](../e/expiration_date.md):** The day on which the option contract ceases to exist. After this date, the [options](../o/options.md) cannot be exercised.

## How a Long Straddle Works

A Long [Straddle](../s/straddle.md) involves buying both a call and a [put option](../p/put.md) on the same [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) with the same [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) and [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md). This dual purchase allows the [investor](../i/investor.md) to [profit](../p/profit.md) from significant price movements in either direction. Here's how it works:

- **Profiting from an upward move:** If the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) increases substantially, the [value](../v/value.md) of the [call option](../c/call_option.md) [will](../w/will.md) rise, offsetting the loss from the [put option](../p/put.md) and potentially leading to a net [profit](../p/profit.md).
- **Profiting from a downward move:** If the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) decreases substantially, the [value](../v/value.md) of the [put option](../p/put.md) [will](../w/will.md) rise, offsetting the loss from the [call option](../c/call_option.md) and potentially leading to a net [profit](../p/profit.md).

## Risk and Reward

### Risk

- **High Initial Cost:** The main [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with a Long [Straddle](../s/straddle.md) is the high initial cost of purchasing both a call and [put option](../p/put.md). This upfront cost needs to be recovered by the profits from the price movements.
- **[Time Decay](../t/time_decay.md):** [Options](../o/options.md) are wasting assets, meaning their [value](../v/value.md) decreases over time. If the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)’s price remains stable, both [options](../o/options.md) can lose [value](../v/value.md) due to [time decay](../t/time_decay.md), leading to a potential loss.
- **Implied [Volatility](../v/volatility.md):** The cost of an option and its potential profitability is significantly affected by implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md). A drop in implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md) can lead to a loss even if the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)’s price moves.

### Reward

- **Unlimited [Profit](../p/profit.md) Potential:** One of the primary advantages of a Long [Straddle](../s/straddle.md) is the unlimited [profit](../p/profit.md) potential. If the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) experiences a significant price increase, the [call option](../c/call_option.md) can provide substantial profits. Similarly, if the [asset](../a/asset.md) experiences a substantial price decrease, the [put option](../p/put.md) can lead to significant profits.
- **Bidirectional Opportunity:** This strategy allows investors to be indifferent to [market](../m/market.md) direction. It capitalizes on significant price movements without having to predict whether the price [will](../w/will.md) go up or down.
  
## Breakeven Points

A Long [Straddle](../s/straddle.md) has two breakeven points:
- **Upper [Breakeven Point](../b/breakeven_point.md):** [Strike Price](../s/strike_price.md) + Total [Premium](../p/premium.md) Paid
- **Lower [Breakeven Point](../b/breakeven_point.md):** [Strike Price](../s/strike_price.md) - Total [Premium](../p/premium.md) Paid

If the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price at expiration is between these two points, the strategy [will](../w/will.md) result in a [net loss](../n/net_loss.md).

## Example

Suppose a [trader](../t/trader.md) executes a Long [Straddle](../s/straddle.md) on stock XYZ, which is currently trading at $100. They purchase both a [call option](../c/call_option.md) and a [put option](../p/put.md). Each option costs $5, meaning the total [premium](../p/premium.md) paid is $10 ($5 for the [call option](../c/call_option.md) + $5 for the [put option](../p/put.md)).

- **Upper Breakeven:** $100 ([strike price](../s/strike_price.md)) + $10 (total [premium](../p/premium.md)) = $110
- **Lower Breakeven:** $100 ([strike price](../s/strike_price.md)) - $10 (total [premium](../p/premium.md)) = $90

This means that for the [trade](../t/trade.md) to be profitable, the stock price needs to move above $110 or below $90 by the [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md).

### Practical Considerations

1. **[Market](../m/market.md) Conditions:** A Long [Straddle](../s/straddle.md) is best employed in markets that are anticipated to experience large swings in price. This can be associated with upcoming [earnings](../e/earnings.md) reports, [geopolitical events](../g/geopolitical_events.md), stock splits, or other significant news.
  
2. **[Volatility](../v/volatility.md) Assessment:** Before implementing a Long [Straddle](../s/straddle.md), it’s crucial to evaluate the implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md). Higher implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md) generally leads to higher option premiums. 

3. **[Time Horizon](../t/time_horizon.md):** The [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md) plays a crucial role in the success of this strategy. The longer the time to expiration, the higher the [premium](../p/premium.md) for the [options](../o/options.md) but also more time for a significant price movement to occur.

## Real-World Application

Major investment firms and [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds often employ sophisticated strategies like Long Straddles. For instance:

- **Goldman Sachs**: Known for their complex [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) and use of [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), they may use Long Straddles in certain [market](../m/market.md) conditions. [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/)
- **JP Morgan:** Another financial giant that uses a variety of option strategies, including Long Straddles, to manage [risk](../r/risk.md) and [profit](../p/profit.md) from [volatility](../v/volatility.md). [JP Morgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com/)

## Conclusion

A Long [Straddle](../s/straddle.md) is a powerful [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md), suitable for traders who anticipate significant [volatility](../v/volatility.md) but are uncertain about the direction of the price move. While it offers unlimited [profit](../p/profit.md) potential, it is also associated with substantial risks, including high initial costs and potential losses due to [time decay](../t/time_decay.md). Successful implementation of a Long [Straddle](../s/straddle.md) requires a keen understanding of [market](../m/market.md) conditions, [volatility](../v/volatility.md), and timing. As with any [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md), [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md) and proper [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) are essential.

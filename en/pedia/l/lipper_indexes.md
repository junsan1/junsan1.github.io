# Lipper Indexes

Lipper Indexes are financial tools used to measure the performance of various investment funds across different categories. These indexes provide investors with a comprehensive view of how different funds are performing relative to each other and serve as benchmarks for [fund](../f/fund.md) managers. Created by Lipper, a subsidiary of Refinitiv (formerly part of Thomson [Reuters](../r/reuters.md)), these indexes encompass a wide [range](../r/range.md) of [investment fund](../i/investment_fund.md) categories including equities, bonds, and mixed-[asset](../a/asset.md) funds.

## Overview of Lipper

Lipper, established in 1973, is one of the most reputable names in the field of [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md) information and performance measurement. It offers proprietary research, tools, and analysis to assist in [fund](../f/fund.md) evaluation. Their primary service areas include [fund](../f/fund.md) performance analysis, [competitive intelligence](../c/competitive_intelligence.md), [fund](../f/fund.md) flows, and [industry analysis](../i/industry_analysis.md). Learn more about Lipper on their [website](https://www.refinitiv.com/en/lipper).

## Structure of Lipper Indexes

Lipper Indexes are categorized broadly into four main types, each designed to focus on specific characteristics or sectors of investment:

1. **[Equity](../e/equity.md) Indexes**
2. **[Bond](../b/bond.md) Indexes**
3. **Mixed-[Asset](../a/asset.md) Indexes**
4. **Other Specialized Indexes**

### 1. Equity Indexes

[Equity](../e/equity.md) indexes encompass a wide [range](../r/range.md) of stock-based funds. These can be further grouped based on regional focus (e.g., U.S., Global, Emerging Markets), investment style (e.g., Growth, [Value](../v/value.md), Blend), and [capitalization](../c/capitalization.md) (e.g., Large-Cap, [Mid-Cap](../m/mid-cap.md), Small-Cap). Some of the prominent Lipper [Equity](../e/equity.md) Indexes include:

- **Lipper U.S. Large-Cap Growth [Index](../i/index.md)**: Tracks the performance of large-cap [growth stocks](../g/growth_stocks.md).
- **Lipper Global [Equity](../e/equity.md) [Index](../i/index.md)**: Provides a measure for global [equity](../e/equity.md) performance.
- **Lipper Emerging Markets [Equity](../e/equity.md) [Index](../i/index.md)**: Measures the performance of funds [investing](../i/investing.md) in emerging [market](../m/market.md) equities.

### 2. Bond Indexes

[Bond](../b/bond.md) indexes track the performance of funds [investing](../i/investing.md) in [debt](../d/debt.md) securities. These are often categorized by the type of [bond](../b/bond.md), such as government bonds, corporate bonds, [municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md), and so on. Specific benchmarks include:

- **Lipper U.S. [Government Bond](../g/government_bond.md) [Index](../i/index.md)**: Tracks funds focusing on U.S. government bonds.
- **Lipper [Corporate Bond](../c/corporate_bond.md) [Index](../i/index.md)**: Focuses on corporate [debt](../d/debt.md) instruments.
- **Lipper High [Yield](../y/yield.md) [Bond](../b/bond.md) [Index](../i/index.md)**: Measures the performance of funds [investing](../i/investing.md) in high-[yield](../y/yield.md), speculative-grade bonds.

### 3. Mixed-Asset Indexes

Mixed-[Asset](../a/asset.md) Indexes, often referred to as [balanced fund](../b/balanced_fund.md) indexes, track funds that invest in a combination of equities and bonds. These indexes are useful for investors looking for a balanced exposure to both [asset](../a/asset.md) classes. Examples are:

- **Lipper Mixed-[Asset](../a/asset.md) Target Allocation Growth [Index](../i/index.md)**: Targets a higher allocation towards equities for growth.
- **Lipper Mixed-[Asset](../a/asset.md) Target Allocation Conservative [Index](../i/index.md)**: Focuses on a more conservative balance with a higher allocation towards bonds.

### 4. Other Specialized Indexes

These indexes cover various niche areas and specific investment styles. Some examples include sector-specific indexes, socially responsible [investing](../i/investing.md) (SRI) indexes, and [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) indexes. Examples include:

- **Lipper [Real Estate](../r/real_estate.md) [Index](../i/index.md)**: Tracks funds [investing](../i/investing.md) primarily in [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) assets.
- **Lipper SRI [Index](../i/index.md)**: Focuses on funds with socially responsible investment strategies.
- **Lipper Sector Specific Indexes**: Includes tech, healthcare, utilities, etc., focused funds.

## The Importance of Lipper Indexes in Investment Decisions

Lipper Indexes play a crucial role for both individual investors and professional [fund](../f/fund.md) managers. Their key benefits include:

- **Benchmarking**: Used as performance benchmarks to evaluate the success of investments or funds.
- **[Performance Attribution](../p/performance_attribution.md)**: Help in attributing performance to different sectors, regions, or [asset](../a/asset.md) classes.
- **[Investment Strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md)**: Aid in forming and refining investment strategies based on historical performance.
- **[Comparative Analysis](../c/comparative_analysis.md)**: Facilitate the comparison of [fund](../f/fund.md) performance within the same category.

## Lipper Rating System

Lipper also provides a highly regarded [rating](../r/rating.md) system known as Lipper Leaders. This system evaluates funds based on five key criteria:

1. **[Total Return](../t/total_return.md)**: Performance measured relative to peers.
2. **Consistent [Return](../r/return.md)**: Stability of returns over time.
3. **[Expense](../e/expense.md)**: Comparative cost-effectiveness of the [fund](../f/fund.md).
4. **Preservation**: Ability to preserve [capital](../c/capital.md) in downturns.
5. **Tax [Efficiency](../e/efficiency.md)**: Post-tax performance measure.

The Lipper Leaders scores [range](../r/range.md) from 1 (worst) to 5 (best) and provide a quick reference for evaluating the quality of a [fund](../f/fund.md).

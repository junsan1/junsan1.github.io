# Law of One Price

The Law of One Price (LOP) is a fundamental concept in [economics](../e/economics.md), [finance](../f/finance.md), and trading that asserts that in an efficient [market](../m/market.md), identical goods or securities should have only one price when expressed in a common [currency](../c/currency.md), when there are no transportation costs and no differential [taxes](../t/taxes.md) applied in the two markets. The Law of One Price is particularly important in the context of global [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), [foreign exchange](../f/foreign_exchange.md) trading, and [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md).

The concept is rooted in the idea that goods or securities should be traded in such a way that prevents the existence of price differentials, and any such differentials, if they exist, are quickly exploited and neutralized by arbitrageurs.

## Theoretical Foundations of the Law of One Price

The Law of One Price is underpinned by the principles of [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) and [market efficiency](../m/market_efficiency.md).

### Arbitrage

[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) involves the simultaneous purchase and [sale](../s/sale.md) of an [asset](../a/asset.md) in different markets to exploit price differentials and make a [profit](../p/profit.md). [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) is the mechanism that enforces the Law of One Price. When price differences for the same [asset](../a/asset.md) exist in different markets, arbitrageurs [will](../w/will.md) buy the [asset](../a/asset.md) in the cheaper [market](../m/market.md) and sell it in the more expensive one, earning a [risk](../r/risk.md)-free [profit](../p/profit.md). This activity [will](../w/will.md) continue until the prices converge and the price differential is eliminated.

### Market Efficiency

[Market efficiency](../m/market_efficiency.md) is the idea that [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) are "informationally efficient," meaning that prices at any given time reflect all available information about assets. In an efficient [market](../m/market.md), [asset](../a/asset.md) prices should adjust immediately to new information, eliminating opportunities for [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) and ensuring that the Law of One Price holds.

## Empirical Evidence for the Law of One Price

The Law of One Price can be observed in various [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), although real-world deviations do occur. Some examples include:

### Foreign Exchange Market

In the [foreign exchange](../f/foreign_exchange.md) [market](../m/market.md), the Law of One Price is observed through the concept of [Purchasing Power](../p/purchasing_power.md) [Parity](../p/parity.md) (PPP). PPP asserts that the [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) between two currencies should equal the ratio of their price levels. For example, if a [basket of goods](../b/basket_of_goods.md) costs $100 in the US and £75 in the UK, the [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) should be $1.33/£1. Deviations from PPP may arise due to transportation costs, tariffs, and other [market](../m/market.md) frictions, but these deviations tend to be temporary.

### Commodity Markets

[Commodity](../c/commodity.md) markets often exhibit adherence to the Law of One Price. For example, gold traded on different exchanges around the world should have the same price when adjusted for [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates and transportation costs. Any significant price differences would lead to [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) opportunities, causing traders to buy gold in cheaper markets and sell in more expensive ones, thereby aligning prices.

### Equity and Bond Markets

In [equity](../e/equity.md) and [bond](../b/bond.md) markets, cross-[listed](../l/listed.md) securities should also adhere to the Law of One Price. A stock [listed](../l/listed.md) on [multiple](../m/multiple.md) exchanges (e.g., a dual-[listed](../l/listed.md) company) should have the same price in each [market](../m/market.md) after [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates and [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md). Similarly, bonds issued by the same entity but traded in different markets should have comparable prices.

## Deviations from the Law of One Price

Despite its theoretical foundations, real-world deviations from the Law of One Price are observed. Some factors that can cause these deviations include:

### Transaction Costs

[Transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md), such as brokerage fees, [taxes](../t/taxes.md), and [bid](../b/bid.md)-ask [spreads](../s/spreads.md), can prevent arbitrageurs from exploiting price differentials, leading to deviations from the Law of One Price.

### Market Frictions

[Market](../m/market.md) frictions, including regulatory barriers, transportation costs, and logistical challenges, can prevent the free flow of goods and securities across markets, causing price differentials.

### Information Asymmetry

Information asymmetry occurs when different [market](../m/market.md) participants have access to different levels of information. This can lead to mispricing and deviations from the Law of One Price as arbitrageurs may not have the necessary information to exploit price differentials.

### Market Sentiment and Behavioral Factors

[Market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) and behavioral factors, such as [investor](../i/investor.md) biases and irrational behavior, can also cause deviations from the Law of One Price. For example, during periods of [market](../m/market.md) turmoil, panic selling or buying can lead to temporary price dislocations.

### Legal and Institutional Constraints

Legal and institutional constraints, such as [capital](../c/capital.md) controls, trading restrictions, and differential tax treatments, can also create barriers to [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), causing price differentials to persist.

## Practical Applications of the Law of One Price

The Law of One Price has important practical applications in the world of trading and investment, particularly in the context of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) and [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategies.

### Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) involves the use of computer algorithms to execute trades based on predefined criteria. Algorithms can be designed to identify and exploit price differentials across markets, ensuring adherence to the Law of One Price. For example, high-frequency trading (HFT) firms use sophisticated algorithms to detect and [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on minute price differences across exchanges within milliseconds.

### Arbitrage Strategies

[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategies rely on the Law of One Price to generate [risk](../r/risk.md)-free profits. Examples of [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategies include:

- **Statistical [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md):** This strategy uses [quantitative models](../q/quantitative_models.md) to identify mispriced securities based on historical price relationships. When securities deviate from their expected price relationships, arbitrageurs execute trades to [profit](../p/profit.md) from the eventual convergence of prices.

- **Triangular [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md):** In the [foreign exchange](../f/foreign_exchange.md) [market](../m/market.md), triangular [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) involves exploiting price discrepancies between three [currency](../c/currency.md) pairs. By simultaneously buying and selling currencies in a way that capitalizes on mispricing, traders can lock in [risk](../r/risk.md)-free profits.

- **[Commodity](../c/commodity.md) [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md):** Traders exploit price differences between the same [commodity](../c/commodity.md) on different exchanges. For example, buying gold on one [exchange](../e/exchange.md) and selling it on another where the price is higher.

# Law of One Price

The Law of One Price (LOP) is a fundamental concept in economics, finance, and trading that asserts that in an efficient market, identical goods or securities should have only one price when expressed in a common currency, when there are no transportation costs and no differential taxes applied in the two markets. The Law of One Price is particularly important in the context of global financial markets, foreign exchange trading, and [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md).

The concept is rooted in the idea that goods or securities should be traded in such a way that prevents the existence of price differentials, and any such differentials, if they exist, are quickly exploited and neutralized by arbitrageurs.

## Theoretical Foundations of the Law of One Price

The Law of One Price is underpinned by the principles of [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) and [market efficiency](../m/market_efficiency.md).

### Arbitrage

[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) involves the simultaneous purchase and sale of an asset in different markets to exploit price differentials and make a profit. [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) is the mechanism that enforces the Law of One Price. When price differences for the same asset exist in different markets, arbitrageurs will buy the asset in the cheaper market and sell it in the more expensive one, earning a risk-free profit. This activity will continue until the prices converge and the price differential is eliminated.

### Market Efficiency

[Market efficiency](../m/market_efficiency.md) is the idea that financial markets are "informationally efficient," meaning that prices at any given time reflect all available information about assets. In an efficient market, asset prices should adjust immediately to new information, eliminating opportunities for [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) and ensuring that the Law of One Price holds.

## Empirical Evidence for the Law of One Price

The Law of One Price can be observed in various financial markets, although real-world deviations do occur. Some examples include:

### Foreign Exchange Market

In the foreign exchange market, the Law of One Price is observed through the concept of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP). PPP asserts that the exchange rate between two currencies should equal the ratio of their price levels. For example, if a basket of goods costs $100 in the US and £75 in the UK, the exchange rate should be $1.33/£1. Deviations from PPP may arise due to transportation costs, tariffs, and other market frictions, but these deviations tend to be temporary.

### Commodity Markets

Commodity markets often exhibit adherence to the Law of One Price. For example, gold traded on different exchanges around the world should have the same price when adjusted for exchange rates and transportation costs. Any significant price differences would lead to [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) opportunities, causing traders to buy gold in cheaper markets and sell in more expensive ones, thereby aligning prices.

### Equity and Bond Markets

In equity and bond markets, cross-listed securities should also adhere to the Law of One Price. A stock listed on multiple exchanges (e.g., a dual-listed company) should have the same price in each market after accounting for exchange rates and transaction costs. Similarly, bonds issued by the same entity but traded in different markets should have comparable prices.

## Deviations from the Law of One Price

Despite its theoretical foundations, real-world deviations from the Law of One Price are observed. Some factors that can cause these deviations include:

### Transaction Costs

Transaction costs, such as brokerage fees, taxes, and bid-ask spreads, can prevent arbitrageurs from exploiting price differentials, leading to deviations from the Law of One Price.

### Market Frictions

Market frictions, including regulatory barriers, transportation costs, and logistical challenges, can prevent the free flow of goods and securities across markets, causing price differentials.

### Information Asymmetry

Information asymmetry occurs when different market participants have access to different levels of information. This can lead to mispricing and deviations from the Law of One Price as arbitrageurs may not have the necessary information to exploit price differentials.

### Market Sentiment and Behavioral Factors

Market sentiment and behavioral factors, such as investor biases and irrational behavior, can also cause deviations from the Law of One Price. For example, during periods of market turmoil, panic selling or buying can lead to temporary price dislocations.

### Legal and Institutional Constraints

Legal and institutional constraints, such as capital controls, trading restrictions, and differential tax treatments, can also create barriers to [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), causing price differentials to persist.

## Practical Applications of the Law of One Price

The Law of One Price has important practical applications in the world of trading and investment, particularly in the context of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) and [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategies.

### Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) involves the use of computer algorithms to execute trades based on predefined criteria. Algorithms can be designed to identify and exploit price differentials across markets, ensuring adherence to the Law of One Price. For example, high-frequency trading (HFT) firms use sophisticated algorithms to detect and capitalize on minute price differences across exchanges within milliseconds.

### Arbitrage Strategies

[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategies rely on the Law of One Price to generate risk-free profits. Examples of [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategies include:

- **Statistical [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md):** This strategy uses [quantitative models](../q/quantitative_models.md) to identify mispriced securities based on historical price relationships. When securities deviate from their expected price relationships, arbitrageurs execute trades to profit from the eventual convergence of prices.

- **Triangular [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md):** In the foreign exchange market, triangular [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) involves exploiting price discrepancies between three currency pairs. By simultaneously buying and selling currencies in a way that capitalizes on mispricing, traders can lock in risk-free profits.

- **Commodity [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md):** Traders exploit price differences between the same commodity on different exchanges. For example, buying gold on one exchange and selling it on another where the price is higher.

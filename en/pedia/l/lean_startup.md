# Lean Startup

## Definition
The **Lean [Startup](../s/startup.md)** is a methodology for developing businesses and products that aims to shorten product development cycles and rapidly discover if a proposed [business](../b/business.md) model is viable. This is achieved by adopting a combination of [business](../b/business.md)-hypothesis-driven experimentation, iterative product releases, and validated learning.

## Key Components
1. **Build-Measure-Learn Feedback Loop**: A core principle of the lean [startup](../s/startup.md) methodology, emphasizing the importance of building a minimum viable product (MVP), measuring its performance, and learning from the results to make iterative improvements.
2. **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**: A version of the product with the minimum features necessary to gather validated learning about the product and its continued development.
3. **Validated Learning**: A process of demonstrating empirically that a team has discovered valuable truths about a [startup](../s/startup.md)'s present and future [business](../b/business.md) prospects.
4. **Pivoting**: Making a fundamental change to the [business](../b/business.md) model based on validated learning and feedback from the MVP testing.

## Importance
1. **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Mitigation**: Reduces the [risk](../r/risk.md) of failure by testing assumptions early in the development process and making data-driven decisions.
2. **Resource [Efficiency](../e/efficiency.md)**: Maximizes the efficient use of resources by avoiding wasteful practices and focusing on what truly adds [value](../v/value.md).
3. **[Customer](../c/customer.md) Focus**: Ensures that the product development process is closely aligned with [customer](../c/customer.md) needs and preferences, increasing the likelihood of [market](../m/market.md) success.

## Example Scenarios
1. **[Startup](../s/startup.md) Development**: A new technology [startup](../s/startup.md) uses the lean [startup](../s/startup.md) methodology to develop a software application. They release an MVP to a small group of users, gather feedback, and make iterative improvements based on the data collected.
2. **Product Launch**: An established company uses the lean [startup](../s/startup.md) approach to launch a new [product line](../p/product_line.md), testing the concept with an MVP and adjusting their strategy based on [customer](../c/customer.md) feedback and [market](../m/market.md) response.
3. **[Business](../b/business.md) Pivot**: A [startup](../s/startup.md) realizes through MVP testing that their initial [business](../b/business.md) model is not viable. They use validated learning to pivot to a new model that better meets [customer](../c/customer.md) needs.

## Process
1. **[Ideation](../i/ideation.md)**: Generate [business](../b/business.md) ideas and hypotheses about potential products or services.
2. **Build**: Develop an MVP to test the core assumptions of the [business](../b/business.md) idea.
3. **Measure**: Collect data on the MVP's performance and [customer](../c/customer.md) interactions to assess viability.
4. **Learn**: Analyze the data to [gain](../g/gain.md) insights and make informed decisions about the next steps.
5. **Iterate**: Use the insights to make iterative improvements to the product or [business](../b/business.md) model.

## Challenges
1. **[Uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md)**: Operating in environments with high [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) can make it challenging to gather meaningful data and insights.
2. **Resource Constraints**: Limited resources can constrain the ability to rapidly iterate and pivot.
3. **[Customer](../c/customer.md) Engagement**: Engaging early adopters and gathering actionable feedback can be difficult, especially for new or niche products.

## Best Practices
1. **Focus on Key Metrics**: Identify and focus on key [performance indicators](../p/performance_indicators.md) (KPIs) that drive [business](../b/business.md) success.
2. **[Customer](../c/customer.md) Involvement**: Engage with customers early and often to gather feedback and validate assumptions.
3. **Adaptability**: Be prepared to pivot or make significant changes based on validated learning and [market](../m/market.md) feedback.
4. **Lean Principles**: Embrace lean principles such as eliminating waste, continuous improvement, and delivering [value](../v/value.md) to customers.

## Conclusion
The lean [startup](../s/startup.md) methodology is a powerful approach for developing new businesses and products. By focusing on iterative development, validated learning, and [customer](../c/customer.md) feedback, lean startups can reduce [risk](../r/risk.md), efficiently use resources, and increase the likelihood of [market](../m/market.md) success. Understanding and implementing the key components, processes, and [best practices](../b/best_practices.md) of the lean [startup](../s/startup.md) can help entrepreneurs and companies innovate effectively and respond to [market](../m/market.md) demands.

# Lisbon Treaty: History, Impact and Opinions

The Lisbon Treaty, also known as the Treaty of Lisbon, is an international agreement that forms the constitutional basis of the European Union (EU). It was signed on December 13, 2007, and came into force on December 1, 2009, following ratification by all EU member states. The treaty aimed to streamline EU institutions and enhance decision-making processes to better meet the challenges of an expanding, modern EU. This article delves into the history, impact, and various opinions surrounding the Lisbon Treaty.

## History

### Background

The origins of the Lisbon Treaty can be traced back to earlier attempts at EU reform, notably the Treaty of Nice and the EU Constitution. The Treaty of Nice, which was signed in 2001, was considered insufficient in addressing the institutional needs of an expanding EU, especially with the forthcoming enlargement in 2004. Consequently, an effort was made to draft a more comprehensive constitution for the EU.

### EU Constitution

In 2004, the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe (commonly referred to as the European Constitution) was proposed. It aimed to replace the existing EU treaties with a single text, thereby simplifying and consolidating the EU's legal framework. However, the constitution faced significant hurdles during the ratification process. Notably, it was rejected in referendums held in France and the Netherlands in 2005, leading to a period of reflection and reconsideration.

### Drafting the Lisbon Treaty

After the rejection of the European Constitution, EU leaders sought to find a more pragmatic solution that retained the core reforms while avoiding the controversies of a "constitution." This led to the drafting of the Lisbon Treaty, which effectively repackaged many of the institutional reforms under a new treaty framework.

### Ratification Process

The Lisbon Treaty faced its own challenges during ratification. Ireland initially rejected the treaty in a 2008 referendum, citing concerns over neutrality, abortion, and loss of sovereignty. However, after securing assurances on these issues, a second referendum was held in 2009, which resulted in a "Yes" vote. Poland and the Czech Republic also delayed ratification, but eventually, all EU member states approved the treaty, enabling it to come into force.

## Key Provisions of the Lisbon Treaty

### Institutional Reforms

1. **European Council President**: The treaty established the position of the President of the European Council, elected by the Council for a two-and-a-half-year term, with the possibility of re-election. This aimed to provide more consistent leadership.

2. **High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy**: The role of the High Representative was created to unify the EU's external actions, combining responsibilities previously held by the European Commissioner for External Relations and the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy.

3. **European Parliament**: The powers of the European Parliament were significantly increased, particularly in terms of legislative and budgetary matters, making it a co-legislator on par with the Council of the European Union in most areas.

### Decision-Making Processes

1. **Qualified Majority Voting (QMV)**: The Lisbon Treaty expanded the use of QMV in the Council of the European Union, reducing the need for unanimity and making decision-making more efficient. The treaty introduced a "double majority" system, requiring a majority of states representing a majority of the EU population for decisions to pass.

2. **Citizens' Initiative**: The treaty introduced the European Citizens' Initiative, allowing EU citizens to directly propose legislative changes if they can gather one million signatures from at least seven different member states.

### Legal Personality and Competence

1. **Legal Personality**: The EU was granted legal personality under the Lisbon Treaty, allowing it to sign international treaties and join international organizations.

2. **Division of Competences**: The treaty clarified the distribution of competences between the EU and its member states, categorizing them into exclusive competences, shared competences, and supporting competences.

## Impact of the Lisbon Treaty

### Institutional Efficiency

The institutional reforms introduced by the Lisbon Treaty have generally been seen as improving the efficiency and consistency of the EU's decision-making processes. The creation of a permanent President of the European Council has provided more continuity in EU leadership, and the High Representative has enhanced the EU's ability to coordinate its foreign policy.

### Democratic Legitimacy

The increased powers of the European Parliament have been viewed positively in terms of enhancing democratic legitimacy within the EU. The Parliament's role in the legislative process and its power over the EU budget ensure that EU citizens have a more significant say in the governance of the Union.

### External Representation

By granting the EU legal personality and strengthening the role of the High Representative, the Lisbon Treaty has improved the EU's ability to act cohesively on the international stage. This has been particularly important in areas such as trade, environmental policy, and diplomacy.

### Challenges and Criticisms

Despite its successes, the Lisbon Treaty has faced criticism and encountered challenges. Some critics argue that the treaty has not fully addressed the EU's democratic deficit, pointing out that too many decisions are still made by unelected officials. Additionally, the treaty's complexity and the opaque nature of EU decision-making processes remain a concern for some citizens.

## Opinions and Perspectives

### Supporters' Views

Supporters of the Lisbon Treaty highlight its role in enhancing the efficiency, coherence, and democratic legitimacy of the EU. They argue that the treaty provides a solid foundation for the EU to tackle current and future challenges, such as economic instability, climate change, and global security threats.

Many proponents also point to the benefits of the treaty's provisions for citizen engagement, such as the European Citizens' Initiative, as a step toward making the EU more responsive to the needs and concerns of its citizens.

### Critics' Views

Critics of the Lisbon Treaty often focus on concerns related to sovereignty and democratic accountability. Some argue that the treaty has led to an over-centralization of power within EU institutions, at the expense of member states' sovereignty. Others believe that the treaty's provisions do not go far enough in addressing the EU's democratic deficit, and call for further reforms to enhance transparency and citizen participation.

### National Perspectives

The Lisbon Treaty has elicited varying responses from different member states, reflecting their unique political, economic, and social contexts. For example:

- **Ireland**: Initial opposition in Ireland highlighted concerns over national sovereignty and neutrality. However, after securing assurances, the treaty was eventually ratified, with proponents arguing that it enhances Ireland's influence within the EU.
- **United Kingdom**: The Lisbon Treaty has been a contentious issue in the UK, where concerns over sovereignty and EU integration contributed to the Brexit referendum in 2016. Critics in the UK saw the treaty as a step toward an "ever-closer union" that undermined national control.
- **Germany and France**: Generally supportive, these countries view the treaty as a necessary step to strengthen the EU's capabilities and ensure its global relevance.

## Conclusion

The Lisbon Treaty represents a significant milestone in the evolution of the European Union, providing a framework for more efficient decision-making, enhanced democratic legitimacy, and more coherent external representation. While it has faced criticism and encountered challenges, the treaty's provisions continue to shape the functioning of the EU and its role on the global stage. As the EU navigates complex issues in an ever-changing world, the Lisbon Treaty's impact and relevance will likely remain a topic of discussion and debate.

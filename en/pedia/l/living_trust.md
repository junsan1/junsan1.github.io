# Living Trust

A Living [Trust](../t/trust.md), also known as an inter vivos [trust](../t/trust.md), is a legal document created during an individual's lifetime wherein a designated person, the [trustee](../t/trustee.md), is given the authority to manage the individual's assets for the benefit of the eventual beneficiaries. Unlike a [will](../w/will.md), a living [trust](../t/trust.md) allows for the transfer of assets without going through the [probate](../p/probate.md) process, which can be time-consuming and expensive. It also provides a mechanism for managing an individual's assets in the event that they become incapacitated. Here's an in-depth look into various aspects of living trusts:

## Types of Living Trusts

### Revocable Living Trust
A revocable living [trust](../t/trust.md) allows the [grantor](../g/grantor.md) to retain control over the assets in the [trust](../t/trust.md) during their lifetime. This means the [grantor](../g/grantor.md) can alter, amend, or revoke the [trust](../t/trust.md) altogether. The key advantages of a revocable living [trust](../t/trust.md) include [probate](../p/probate.md) avoidance, privacy, and the ability to manage assets in the event of incapacity.

### Irrevocable Living Trust
An irrevocable living [trust](../t/trust.md), on the other hand, does not allow the [grantor](../g/grantor.md) to alter or revoke the [trust](../t/trust.md) once it's established. This type of [trust](../t/trust.md) is often used for [tax planning](../t/tax_planning.md) and [asset protection](../a/asset_protection.md), as the assets are no longer considered part of the [grantor](../g/grantor.md)'s [estate](../e/estate.md) for tax purposes.

## How a Living Trust Works

1. **Creation**: The [grantor](../g/grantor.md) creates the [trust](../t/trust.md) document, outlining the terms and conditions under which the [trust](../t/trust.md) [will](../w/will.md) operate. This includes naming a [trustee](../t/trustee.md) and beneficiaries.

2. **Funding**: The [grantor](../g/grantor.md) transfers assets into the [trust](../t/trust.md). This can include [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), [bank](../b/bank.md) accounts, investment accounts, and [personal property](../p/personal_property.md).

3. **Management**: The [trustee](../t/trustee.md) manages the [trust](../t/trust.md) assets according to the terms set forth in the [trust](../t/trust.md) document. In a [revocable trust](../r/revocable_trust.md), the [grantor](../g/grantor.md) often acts as the initial [trustee](../t/trustee.md), retaining control over the assets.

4. **[Distribution](../d/distribution.md)**: Upon the [grantor](../g/grantor.md)'s death, the [trustee](../t/trustee.md) distributes the [trust](../t/trust.md) assets to the beneficiaries according to the terms of the [trust](../t/trust.md) document, bypassing [probate](../p/probate.md).

## Benefits of a Living Trust

### Avoidance of Probate
One of the most significant benefits of a living [trust](../t/trust.md) is that it allows assets to pass directly to the beneficiaries without going through [probate](../p/probate.md). [Probate](../p/probate.md) can be a lengthy and costly process, often taking months or even years to complete. By avoiding [probate](../p/probate.md), beneficiaries [gain](../g/gain.md) quicker access to the assets.

### Privacy
A living [trust](../t/trust.md) provides a level of privacy not afforded by a [will](../w/will.md). Probated wills become part of the public record, whereas the terms of a living [trust](../t/trust.md) remain private. This can be particularly important for individuals who wish to keep the details of their [estate](../e/estate.md) plan confidential.

### Incapacity Planning
A living [trust](../t/trust.md) includes provisions for the management of the [grantor](../g/grantor.md)'s assets in the event they become incapacitated. This ensures that the [grantor](../g/grantor.md)'s financial affairs are managed according to their wishes, without the need for court intervention.

### Flexibility
Revocable living trusts [offer](../o/offer.md) a high degree of flexibility, allowing the [grantor](../g/grantor.md) to make changes as their circumstances change. This can include adding or removing assets, changing beneficiaries, or altering the terms of the [trust](../t/trust.md).

### Tax Benefits
Irrevocable living trusts can provide significant tax benefits, particularly for high-net-worth individuals. By removing assets from the [grantor](../g/grantor.md)'s [estate](../e/estate.md), it reduces the taxable [estate](../e/estate.md) and potentially lowers [estate](../e/estate.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md).

## Drawbacks of a Living Trust

### Complexity and Cost
Creating a living [trust](../t/trust.md) can be more complex and expensive than drafting a simple [will](../w/will.md). It requires the assistance of an attorney, and there may be additional costs associated with transferring assets into the [trust](../t/trust.md).

### Administrative Burden
Managing a living [trust](../t/trust.md) requires ongoing administrative effort. This includes changing the title of assets, maintaining accurate records, and managing the [trust](../t/trust.md) according to its terms. Some individuals may find this burdensome and prefer the simplicity of a [will](../w/will.md).

### No Probate Cost Savings with Small Estates
For individuals with small estates, the cost savings associated with avoiding [probate](../p/probate.md) may be minimal. In such cases, a simple [will](../w/will.md) may be a more cost-effective solution.

## Creating a Living Trust

### Choose the Type of Trust
The first step in creating a living [trust](../t/trust.md) is to decide whether a revocable or [irrevocable trust](../i/irrevocable_trust.md) best suits your needs. Consult with an [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md) attorney to determine which option aligns with your goals.

### Draft the Trust Document
Work with an attorney to draft the [trust](../t/trust.md) document. This [will](../w/will.md) include naming the [trustee](../t/trustee.md), outlining the terms of the [trust](../t/trust.md), and specifying the beneficiaries. The document should also include provisions for handling incapacity and the [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of assets upon death.

### Fund the Trust
Transfer ownership of your assets to the [trust](../t/trust.md). This process, known as "funding" the [trust](../t/trust.md), involves changing the titles of your assets to reflect the [trust](../t/trust.md) as the owner. This can include deeds for [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), changing the ownership of [bank](../b/bank.md) accounts, and updating [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md) designations on retirement accounts and [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policies.

### Manage the Trust
Once the [trust](../t/trust.md) is funded, manage the assets according to the terms of the [trust](../t/trust.md) document. If you are acting as your own [trustee](../t/trustee.md), continue to oversee your assets as you normally would but be mindful of the [trust](../t/trust.md)'s requirements.

### Review and Update
Periodically review the [trust](../t/trust.md) document and make any necessary updates to reflect changes in your circumstances or goals. This is particularly important for revocable living trusts, as your needs may evolve over time.

## Special Considerations

### Joint Trusts
Married couples often create [joint](../j/joint.md) living trusts, which can simplify [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md) by consolidating their assets into a single [trust](../t/trust.md). [Joint](../j/joint.md) trusts can provide for the seamless transfer of assets upon the death of the first spouse and ensure that the remaining assets are managed and distributed according to the couple's wishes.

### Pour-Over Wills
Many individuals use a combination of a living [trust](../t/trust.md) and a pour-over [will](../w/will.md). The pour-over [will](../w/will.md) serves as a safety net, ensuring that any assets not transferred into the [trust](../t/trust.md) during the [grantor](../g/grantor.md)'s lifetime are "poured over" into the [trust](../t/trust.md) upon their death. This provides a comprehensive [estate](../e/estate.md) plan that covers all assets.

### Trust Administration
The administration of a [trust](../t/trust.md) involves several responsibilities, including managing the [trust](../t/trust.md) assets, filing tax returns, and distributing assets to beneficiaries. Trustees must act in the best [interest](../i/interest.md) of the beneficiaries and in accordance with the terms of the [trust](../t/trust.md) document. Choosing a trusted and capable individual or institution as [trustee](../t/trustee.md) is critical to the successful administration of the [trust](../t/trust.md).

## Conclusion

A living [trust](../t/trust.md) can be a powerful tool in [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md), [offering](../o/offering.md) numerous benefits such as [probate](../p/probate.md) avoidance, privacy, and incapacity planning. However, it is essential to weigh these benefits against the potential drawbacks, such as complexity and cost. Consulting with an experienced [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md) attorney can help you determine whether a living [trust](../t/trust.md) is the right choice for your [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md) needs and ensure that your [trust](../t/trust.md) is properly drafted and administered.

Understanding the nuances of living trusts enables individuals to make informed decisions about their [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md) and secure their assets for their loved onesâ€™ future.

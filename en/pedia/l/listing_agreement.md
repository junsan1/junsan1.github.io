# Listing Agreement

A listing agreement is a formal contract between a [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) [broker](../b/broker.md) and a property owner that allows the [broker](../b/broker.md) to act as the owner’s agent in the [sale](../s/sale.md) of the property. In the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), a listing agreement is an agreement between a company and a stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md), stipulating the conditions under which a company [will](../w/will.md) be [listed](../l/listed.md) and traded on that [exchange](../e/exchange.md).

## Purpose of a Listing Agreement

## Types of Listing Agreements

### Initial Listing Agreement

When a company first decides to go public, it must sign an initial listing agreement with the stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md).

### Continuing Listing Agreement

After a company is [listed](../l/listed.md), it must adhere to a continuing listing agreement that ensures ongoing compliance with the [exchange](../e/exchange.md)'s rules and regulations. This includes the periodic submission of financial reports, [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) of material events, and adherence to [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) practices.

## Global Perspectives on Listing Agreements

While the fundamental principles of listing agreements are similar across various stock exchanges, individual exchanges may have specific requirements based on local laws and regulations.

### United States

In the United States, companies [listed](../l/listed.md) on the New York Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (NYSE) or [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md) must comply with the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) regulations. These regulations are designed to protect investors by ensuring [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and accountability.

### European Union

In the [European Union](../e/european_union_(eu).md), companies must comply with the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) guidelines. These guidelines focus on enhancing [investor](../i/investor.md) protection and promoting stable and orderly [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

### Asia

In Asia, stock exchanges like the Tokyo Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (TSE) and the Hong Kong Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (HKEX) have their own [listing requirements](../l/listing_requirements.md), often influenced by local [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) standards and regulatory environments.

## Technology and Listing Agreements

### Automation and Reporting

Advancements in technology have streamlined the reporting process required under listing agreements. Automation tools and software can help companies efficiently manage their compliance responsibilities, reducing the [risk](../r/risk.md) of errors and ensuring timely submissions.

### Blockchain and Transparency

[Blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology is being explored as a means to enhance [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and [security](../s/security.md) in financial reporting. By using a decentralized ledger, companies can provide immutable records that are easily verifiable by investors and regulators.

### FinTech Solutions

FinTech companies are developing innovative solutions to help companies manage their [listing requirements](../l/listing_requirements.md) more effectively. These solutions include automated compliance software, [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) tools, and platforms for better [investor](../i/investor.md) communication.

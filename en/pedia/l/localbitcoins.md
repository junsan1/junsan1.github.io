# LocalBitcoins

LocalBitcoins is a peer-to-peer (P2P) cryptocurrency [exchange](../e/exchange.md) platform that facilitates the buying and selling of [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) between users. Unlike centralized exchanges such as [Binance](../b/binance.md) or [Coinbase](../c/coinbase.md), LocalBitcoins provides a marketplace where individuals can [trade](../t/trade.md) [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) directly with one another. The platform was founded in 2012 by Nicholas Kangas and is based in Helsinki, Finland.

## Introduction

LocalBitcoins allows users to post advertisements where they state the [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) and [payment](../p/payment.md) methods for purchasing or selling [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md). Other users can then respond to these advertisements and agree to [trade](../t/trade.md) [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) directly. The platform supports a wide [range](../r/range.md) of [payment](../p/payment.md) methods, including [bank](../b/bank.md) transfers, [PayPal](../p/paypal.md), and cash [deposit](../d/deposit.md), among others.

## Key Features

1. **Peer-to-Peer Trading**: Users [trade](../t/trade.md) directly with one another. LocalBitcoins serves as a platform to facilitate these trades.
2. **[Multiple](../m/multiple.md) [Payment](../p/payment.md) Methods**: The platform supports various [payment](../p/payment.md) methods, including [bank](../b/bank.md) transfers, online [payment](../p/payment.md) systems, and cash trades.
3. **Global Reach**: LocalBitcoins is available in almost every country, making it accessible to users worldwide.

5. **Reputation System**: Users can leave feedback and reviews after a [trade](../t/trade.md), which helps build [trust](../t/trust.md) within the community.
6. **KYC and AML Compliance**: LocalBitcoins requires users to go through a Know Your [Customer](../c/customer.md) (KYC) process to comply with Anti-[Money Laundering](../m/money_laundering.md) (AML) regulations.

## How It Works

### Registering an Account

To begin trading on LocalBitcoins, a user must first create an account. The registration process involves providing basic personal information and email verification. Once registered, users can enhance account [security](../s/security.md) through Two-[Factor](../f/factor.md) Authentication (2FA).

### Posting an Advertisement

Users who want to buy or sell [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) can post an advertisement. The ad details include the desired [trade](../t/trade.md) type (buy or sell), [payment](../p/payment.md) method, location, and [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md). Users can also set trading limits and conditions to filter potential trades.

### Responding to an Advertisement

If a user finds a suitable advertisement, they can respond to it, initiating a [trade](../t/trade.md). The user sends a [trade](../t/trade.md) request, and the ad poster can either accept or decline it. Once accepted, both parties can proceed with the [trade](../t/trade.md).

### Completing the Trade

After the [trade](../t/trade.md) request is accepted, the process typically follows these steps:

1. **[Escrow](../e/escrow.md)**: LocalBitcoins puts the [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) to be sold [in escrow](../i/in_escrow.md). This ensures that the buyer receives the [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) once the seller confirms receipt of [payment](../p/payment.md).
2. **[Payment](../p/payment.md)**: The buyer sends the agreed amount using the specified [payment](../p/payment.md) method.
3. **Confirmation**: The seller confirms that they have received the [payment](../p/payment.md).
4. **Release**: LocalBitcoins releases the [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) from [escrow](../e/escrow.md) to the buyer.

This process is designed to secure trades and minimize the [risk](../r/risk.md) of [fraud](../f/fraud.md).

## Trading Metrics and Statistics

LocalBitcoins provides various metrics and [statistics](../s/statistics.md) that help traders make informed decisions. Some of these include:

- **Price Charts**: Historical and real-time [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) price data.
- **[Volume](../v/volume.md) Charts**: Trading [volume](../v/volume.md) over different periods.
- **[Payment](../p/payment.md) Method [Distribution](../d/distribution.md)**: Popular [payment](../p/payment.md) methods among users.
- **Regional Trends**: Trading trends in different geographic regions.

These analytics tools are crucial for traders to assess [market](../m/market.md) conditions and optimize their [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

## Security Measures

LocalBitcoins takes several measures to ensure the [security](../s/security.md) of its platform and users:

1. **[Escrow](../e/escrow.md) Services**: As mentioned earlier, the [escrow](../e/escrow.md) system holds [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) until both parties confirm the completion of the [transaction](../t/transaction.md).
2. **Two-[Factor](../f/factor.md) Authentication (2FA)**: Users can enable 2FA to add an extra layer of [security](../s/security.md) to their accounts.
3. **Login Guard**: This feature notifies users of any unauthorized login attempts from unrecognized devices.
4. **KYC and AML Compliance**: By requiring identity verification, LocalBitcoins aims to prevent illegal activities such as [money laundering](../m/money_laundering.md).
5. **Encryption**: The platform uses SSL encryption to protect user data and communications.
6. **Support Team**: A dedicated support team is available to resolve any [security](../s/security.md)-related issues or disputes.

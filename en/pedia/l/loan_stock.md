# Loan Stock

[Loan](../l/loan.md) stock is a type of [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) that represents a borrower's [debt](../d/debt.md) obligation to the [lender](../l/lender.md). It is typically issued by companies or other entities to raise [capital](../c/capital.md). Investors who purchase [loan](../l/loan.md) stock are essentially loaning [money](../m/money.md) to the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) in [exchange](../e/exchange.md) for periodic [interest](../i/interest.md) payments and the [return](../r/return.md) of the [principal](../p/principal.md) at [maturity](../m/maturity.md). [Loan](../l/loan.md) stock can come in various forms, including debentures, bonds, and notes, and they can be secured or unsecured.

## Types of Loan Stock

1. **Debentures**: These are [unsecured loan](../u/unsecured_loan.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) that rely on the [issuer](../i/issuer.md)’s [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md). While they do not have [collateral](../c/collateral.md), they often come with covenants to protect investors.
   
2. **Bonds**: Bonds are a more commonly known form of [loan](../l/loan.md) stock that can be secured or unsecured. They are often issued by governments, municipalities, or corporations and come with a [fixed interest rate](../f/fixed_interest_rate.md) and a [maturity date](../m/maturity_date.md).
   
3. **Notes**: These are shorter-[term loan](../t/term_loan.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) compared to bonds and debentures. Notes are typically unsecured and can either have a fixed or [variable interest rate](../v/variable_interest_rate.md).

## Characteristics of Loan Stock

1. **Fixed [Interest](../i/interest.md) Payments**: [Loan](../l/loan.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) usually come with a predetermined [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) that is paid out periodically. This makes them an attractive option for [income](../i/income.md)-focused investors.
   
2. **[Maturity Date](../m/maturity_date.md)**: [Loan](../l/loan.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) have a specific [maturity date](../m/maturity_date.md) at which the [principal](../p/principal.md) amount is to be repaid to the investors.

3. **Marketability**: [Loan](../l/loan.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) can often be traded on public exchanges, making them relatively [liquid](../l/liquid.md), although the ease of trading can be affected by the [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) of the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) and [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

4. **[Credit Rating](../c/credit_rating.md)**: Many [loan](../l/loan.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) are rated by [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) agencies. These ratings provide investors with an evaluation of the [issuer](../i/issuer.md)'s ability to meet its [debt](../d/debt.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md).

## Advantages of Loan Stock

1. **Steady [Income](../i/income.md)**: The fixed [interest](../i/interest.md) payments provide a steady stream of [income](../i/income.md), which can be especially beneficial for retirees or [income](../i/income.md)-focused investors.

2. **Lower [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: [Loan](../l/loan.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) are generally considered to be less risky than [equity](../e/equity.md) investments because they have a predefined [interest](../i/interest.md) [payment](../p/payment.md) and [maturity date](../m/maturity_date.md). In case of [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md), [loan](../l/loan.md) stock investors are prioritized over [equity](../e/equity.md) investors.

3. **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: Adding [loan](../l/loan.md) stock to a diversified investment portfolio can reduce overall [risk](../r/risk.md) through [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md).

## Disadvantages of Loan Stock

1. **[Interest Rate Risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md)**: The [value](../v/value.md) of [loan](../l/loan.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) is inversely related to [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. When [interest](../i/interest.md) rates rise, the [value](../v/value.md) of existing [loan](../l/loan.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) typically falls.

2. **[Credit Risk](../c/credit_risk.md)**: The [issuer](../i/issuer.md) may [default](../d/default.md) on [interest](../i/interest.md) payments or [fail](../f/fail.md) to [return](../r/return.md) the [principal](../p/principal.md) at [maturity](../m/maturity.md), especially if they face financial difficulties.

3. **Lower Returns**: Compared to equities, [loan](../l/loan.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) generally [offer](../o/offer.md) lower returns, which may not be adequate to meet some investors’ financial goals.

## Valuation of Loan Stock

Valuing [loan](../l/loan.md) stock involves considering the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of future [interest](../i/interest.md) payments and the [principal](../p/principal.md) amount to be received at [maturity](../m/maturity.md). The [discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md) used in this calculation is typically the [market](../m/market.md) [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) for similar [loan](../l/loan.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md). Here's a simplified formula:

\[ PV ([Loan](../l/loan.md) Stock) = \sum \left( \frac{C_i}{(1 + r)^i} \right) + \frac{F}{(1 + r)^n} \]

Where:
- \(C_i\) = Coupon [payment](../p/payment.md) in period i
- \(r\) = [Market](../m/market.md) [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md)
- \(F\) = [Face value](../f/face_value.md) of [loan](../l/loan.md) stock
- \(n\) = Number of periods until [maturity](../m/maturity.md)

## Regulatory Environment

[Loan](../l/loan.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) are subject to various regulations depending on the country of issuance. For example, in the United States, the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) regulates the issuance and trading of [loan](../l/loan.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) to protect investors and maintain fair and efficient markets. Similarly, in the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) oversees such activities.

## Prominent Issuers

Many organizations [issue](../i/issue.md) [loan](../l/loan.md) stock to meet their [financing](../f/financing.md) needs, including:

1. **Corporations**: Businesses often [issue](../i/issue.md) [loan](../l/loan.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) to [fund](../f/fund.md) [expansion](../e/expansion.md) or other [capital](../c/capital.md)-intensive projects. Examples include blue-chip companies like Apple, Microsoft, and General Electric.

2. **Governments**: Governments [issue](../i/issue.md) bonds to [finance](../f/finance.md) public spending. For example, [U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) Bonds are a form of [loan](../l/loan.md) stock issued by the federal government.

3. **Municipalities**: Local governments [issue](../i/issue.md) [municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md) to [fund](../f/fund.md) [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) projects like schools, roads, and hospitals.

# Leaseback

A leaseback, also known as a [sale](../s/sale.md)-leaseback or [sale](../s/sale.md) and leaseback, is a financial [transaction](../t/transaction.md) where an [asset](../a/asset.md) is sold and then leased back over a long period. This allows the seller to continue using the [asset](../a/asset.md) but no longer owning it. This mechanism is widely used in various industries to unlock the [capital](../c/capital.md) tied up in fixed assets, enhance [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), and improve [capital structure](../c/capital_structure.md).

## Structure of a Leaseback

At its core, a leaseback [transaction](../t/transaction.md) consists of two primary elements:
1. **[Sale](../s/sale.md):** The company (seller) sells an [asset](../a/asset.md) to a buyer (lessor).
2. **Lease:** The company simultaneously enters into a lease agreement with the buyer to use the [asset](../a/asset.md) for a specified period.

### Illustration with an Example

Let's consider a company, ABC Corp., which owns an office building. ABC Corp. sells the office building to XYZ [Real Estate](../r/real_estate.md) for $10 million. Concurrently, ABC Corp. signs a lease agreement to rent the office building from XYZ [Real Estate](../r/real_estate.md) for 15 years with an annual lease [payment](../p/payment.md).

## Key Drivers for Leaseback Arrangements

### 1. **Capital Unlocking**

By selling an [asset](../a/asset.md) and leasing it back, companies can free up substantial amounts of [capital](../c/capital.md), which can then be reinvested into core operations, [expansion](../e/expansion.md), or [debt](../d/debt.md) reduction. This increase in [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) is one of the primary reasons organizations opt for leasebacks.

### 2. **Off-Balance-Sheet Financing**

Leaseback arrangements might be used to improve financial metrics by converting owned assets to leased assets, impacting the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) and potentially improving [return on assets](../r/return_on_assets_(roa).md) (ROA). Since leased assets do not appear as liabilities on the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) in operating leases, this can enhance [financial ratios](../f/financial_ratios.md).

### 3. **Tax Benefits**

[Lease payments](../l/lease_payments.md) are usually tax-deductible, reducing [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md) and providing tax advantages. Additionally, [capital](../c/capital.md) gains from the [sale](../s/sale.md) may be deferred or spread over the lease term, depending on the jurisdiction.

### 4. **Flexibility and Focus**

Leasebacks allow companies to retain operational control over critical assets without bearing ownership risks. This allows firms to focus on their [core competencies](../c/core_competencies.md) without the burdens of [asset](../a/asset.md) maintenance and [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md).

## Types of Leaseback Arrangements

### 1. **Operating Lease**

An [operating lease](../o/operating_lease.md) is usually short-term and does not transfer ownership rights to the [lessee](../l/lessee.md). The primary goal here is to use the [asset](../a/asset.md) without the risks associated with ownership. This type is common in equipment and technology sectors where assets might become obsolete quickly.

### 2. **Capital Lease (Or Finance Lease)**

A [capital](../c/capital.md) lease is long-term and usually covers the majority of the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s [useful life](../u/useful_life.md). In a [capital](../c/capital.md) lease, the [lessee](../l/lessee.md) enjoys certain ownership benefits and often has an option to purchase the [asset](../a/asset.md) at the end of the lease term at a favorable price. This is more common in [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) transactions.

### 3. **Triple Net Lease (NNN)**

In a triple [net lease](../n/net_lease.md), the [lessee](../l/lessee.md) assumes all operational costs of the property, including maintenance, [taxes](../t/taxes.md), and [insurance](../i/insurance.md), in addition to [lease payments](../l/lease_payments.md). This structure is beneficial for lessors as it passes most operational burdens to the [lessee](../l/lessee.md).

## Sectors and Assets Commonly Involved in Leaseback Transactions

### 1. **Real Estate**

[Commercial real estate](../c/commercial_real_estate.md) transactions are the most prevalent form of leasebacks. Companies sell office buildings, retail spaces, or industrial properties and lease them back to retain operational control. [Real estate](../r/real_estate.md) investment trusts (REITs) are significant participants in these deals.

### 2. **Aviation**

Airlines frequently engage in leaseback transactions for aircraft. This helps them manage fleet requirements flexibly and maintain [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) for other operational needs.

### 3. **Retail and Hospitality**

Retail chains and hotel operators use leaseback transactions for their physical locations. 

### 4. **Equipment Leasing**

High-[value](../v/value.md) equipment in industries like [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md), IT, and healthcare is often financed through leasebacks to avoid [capital](../c/capital.md)-intensive purchases.

## Pros and Cons of Leaseback Transactions

### Pros

1. **Enhanced [Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md):** Immediate cash inflow from the [sale](../s/sale.md) of the [asset](../a/asset.md).
2. **Tax [Efficiency](../e/efficiency.md):** [Lease payments](../l/lease_payments.md) are tax-deductible.
3. **Operational Control:** Continued usage of sold assets.
4. **Off-Balance-Sheet [Financing](../f/financing.md):** Potentially improved [financial ratios](../f/financial_ratios.md).

### Cons

1. **Lease [Obligations](../o/obligation.md):** Long-term commitments to [lease payments](../l/lease_payments.md).
2. **Potential Higher Costs:** Over time, [lease payments](../l/lease_payments.md) may exceed the cost of maintaining ownership.
3. **Loss of [Asset](../a/asset.md) Appreciation:** Sellers relinquish benefits from potential [asset](../a/asset.md) [value](../v/value.md) increase.
4. **Complexity:** Negotiating and structuring leaseback transactions can be complex and resource-intensive.

## Conclusion

Leaseback arrangements [offer](../o/offer.md) a strategic financial tool for companies to unlock [capital](../c/capital.md), manage [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), and improve financial metrics while maintaining operational control over critical assets. While advantageous, these transactions necessitate careful evaluation of long-term commitments, potential costs, and impacts on [asset management](../a/asset_management.md). Thus, both lessees and lessors should conduct thorough [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md) to ensure that leaseback agreements align with their broader financial and operational objectives.

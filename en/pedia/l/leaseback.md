# Leaseback

A leaseback, also known as a sale-leaseback or sale and leaseback, is a financial transaction where an asset is sold and then leased back over a long period. This allows the seller to continue using the asset but no longer owning it. This mechanism is widely used in various industries to unlock the capital tied up in fixed assets, enhance liquidity, and improve capital structure.

## Structure of a Leaseback

At its core, a leaseback transaction consists of two primary elements:
1. **Sale:** The company (seller) sells an asset to a buyer (lessor).
2. **Lease:** The company simultaneously enters into a lease agreement with the buyer to use the asset for a specified period.

### Illustration with an Example

Let's consider a company, ABC Corp., which owns an office building. ABC Corp. sells the office building to XYZ Real Estate for $10 million. Concurrently, ABC Corp. signs a lease agreement to rent the office building from XYZ Real Estate for 15 years with an annual lease payment.

## Key Drivers for Leaseback Arrangements

### 1. **Capital Unlocking**

By selling an asset and leasing it back, companies can free up substantial amounts of capital, which can then be reinvested into core operations, expansion, or debt reduction. This increase in liquidity is one of the primary reasons organizations opt for leasebacks.

### 2. **Off-Balance-Sheet Financing**

Leaseback arrangements might be used to improve financial metrics by converting owned assets to leased assets, impacting the balance sheet and potentially improving return on assets (ROA). Since leased assets do not appear as liabilities on the balance sheet in operating leases, this can enhance financial ratios.

### 3. **Tax Benefits**

Lease payments are usually tax-deductible, reducing taxable income and providing tax advantages. Additionally, capital gains from the sale may be deferred or spread over the lease term, depending on the jurisdiction.

### 4. **Flexibility and Focus**

Leasebacks allow companies to retain operational control over critical assets without bearing ownership risks. This allows firms to focus on their core competencies without the burdens of asset maintenance and depreciation.

## Types of Leaseback Arrangements

### 1. **Operating Lease**

An operating lease is usually short-term and does not transfer ownership rights to the lessee. The primary goal here is to use the asset without the risks associated with ownership. This type is common in equipment and technology sectors where assets might become obsolete quickly.

### 2. **Capital Lease (Or Finance Lease)**

A capital lease is long-term and usually covers the majority of the asset's useful life. In a capital lease, the lessee enjoys certain ownership benefits and often has an option to purchase the asset at the end of the lease term at a favorable price. This is more common in real estate transactions.

### 3. **Triple Net Lease (NNN)**

In a triple net lease, the lessee assumes all operational costs of the property, including maintenance, taxes, and insurance, in addition to lease payments. This structure is beneficial for lessors as it passes most operational burdens to the lessee.

## Sectors and Assets Commonly Involved in Leaseback Transactions

### 1. **Real Estate**

Commercial real estate transactions are the most prevalent form of leasebacks. Companies sell office buildings, retail spaces, or industrial properties and lease them back to retain operational control. Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are significant participants in these deals.

### 2. **Aviation**

Airlines frequently engage in leaseback transactions for aircraft. This helps them manage fleet requirements flexibly and maintain liquidity for other operational needs.

### 3. **Retail and Hospitality**

Retail chains and hotel operators use leaseback transactions for their physical locations. 

### 4. **Equipment Leasing**

High-value equipment in industries like manufacturing, IT, and healthcare is often financed through leasebacks to avoid capital-intensive purchases.

## Pros and Cons of Leaseback Transactions

### Pros

1. **Enhanced Liquidity:** Immediate cash inflow from the sale of the asset.
2. **Tax Efficiency:** Lease payments are tax-deductible.
3. **Operational Control:** Continued usage of sold assets.
4. **Off-Balance-Sheet Financing:** Potentially improved financial ratios.

### Cons

1. **Lease Obligations:** Long-term commitments to lease payments.
2. **Potential Higher Costs:** Over time, lease payments may exceed the cost of maintaining ownership.
3. **Loss of Asset Appreciation:** Sellers relinquish benefits from potential asset value increase.
4. **Complexity:** Negotiating and structuring leaseback transactions can be complex and resource-intensive.

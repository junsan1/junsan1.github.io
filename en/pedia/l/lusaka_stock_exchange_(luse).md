# Lusaka Stock Exchange (LuSE)

The Lusaka Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (LuSE) is the primary stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md) of Zambia, located in the [capital](../c/capital.md) city, Lusaka.

## History and Development

The Lusaka Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) was inaugurated on February 21, 1994, as a collaborative effort between the Zambian government, the [International Finance Corporation](../i/international_finance_corporation.md) (IFC), and the Stockholm Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md).

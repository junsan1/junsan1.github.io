# Lusaka Stock Exchange (LuSE)

The Lusaka Stock Exchange (LuSE) is the primary stock exchange of Zambia, located in the capital city, Lusaka. It was established in 1993 to provide a marketplace for trading securities and facilitate capital raising in Zambia. The LuSE plays a fundamental role in the economic development of the country by mobilizing capital for businesses and offering investment opportunities to both local and international investors.

## History and Development

The Lusaka Stock Exchange was inaugurated on February 21, 1994, as a collaborative effort between the Zambian government, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the Stockholm Stock Exchange. The establishment of LuSE was driven by the Zambian government's economic reforms aimed at liberalizing the economy and promoting private sector growth. Initially, the exchange was modest, with the first listing being the Zambia Commercial Bank (now known as ZANACO).

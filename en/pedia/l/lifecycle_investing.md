# Lifecycle Investing

## Introduction
Lifecycle [investing](../i/investing.md), also known as lifecycle-based [investing](../i/investing.md), is an [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) tailored to an individual's lifecycle stages. Unlike traditional investment strategies that often aim for a balanced portfolio regardless of the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s age, lifecycle [investing](../i/investing.md) considers an individual's age, [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md), financial goals, and other personal factors. This strategy seeks to optimize the allocation of assets over time to achieve financial objectives, such as retirement savings, while mitigating risks.

## Fundamental Principles
The fundamental principles of lifecycle [investing](../i/investing.md) include:

1. **Age-Based [Risk](../r/risk.md) Adjustment**: Younger investors traditionally have a higher [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) because they have a longer [time horizon](../t/time_horizon.md) to recover from potential [market](../m/market.md) downturns. As investors age, their ability to recover diminishes, prompting a shift to less risky investments.
   
2. **[Asset Allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md)**: At different stages of life, the mix of assets (such as [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), and cash) within a portfolio should be adjusted. Younger investors might focus on growth-oriented assets (like equities), while older investors might prioritize [income](../i/income.md)-producing and safer assets (like bonds).

3. **[Glide Path](../g/glide_path.md)**: This is the predetermined adjustment of [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) as the [investor](../i/investor.md) ages. For example, a [glide path](../g/glide_path.md) might recommend moving from an 80/20 stock-to-[bond](../b/bond.md) ratio at age 30 to a 50/50 ratio by age 60.

## Stages of Lifecycle Investing
Lifecycle [investing](../i/investing.md) can typically be divided into several stages:

1. **Early Career (20s to 30s)**: 
   - **Objective**: [Capital](../c/capital.md) accumulation and growth.
   - **Strategy**: High-[risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) with a focus on [equity](../e/equity.md) investments.
   - **Typical Allocation**: High percentage in [stocks](../s/stock.md), potentially 80-90%.

2. **Mid Career (40s to early 50s)**:
   - **Objective**: Continued growth with some [risk management](../r/risk_management.md).
   - **Strategy**: Balanced approach, gradually reducing [risk](../r/risk.md) exposure.
   - **Typical Allocation**: Moderate mix with a higher inclination towards equities, around 60-70%.

3. **Pre-Retirement (Mid 50s to early 60s)**:
   - **Objective**: Protecting the accumulated [capital](../c/capital.md).
   - **Strategy**: Further lowering [risk](../r/risk.md) by increasing the allocation to [fixed income](../f/fixed_income.md).
   - **Typical Allocation**: Balanced split between [stocks](../s/stock.md) and bonds, approximately 50-60% in equities.

4. **Retirement (65+)**:
   - **Objective**: [Income](../i/income.md) generation and [preservation of capital](../p/preservation_of_capital.md).
   - **Strategy**: Low [risk](../r/risk.md), focusing on [income](../i/income.md)-producing investments and maintaining enough [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).
   - **Typical Allocation**: Higher percentage in bonds, possibly 40-50% in equities.

## Benefits of Lifecycle Investing
- **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Adjusting the [risk](../r/risk.md) profile appropriate for each stage of life helps in mitigating potential losses during [market](../m/market.md) downturns.
- **Goal Alignment**: Aligns [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) with long-term financial goals, such as retirement, education, and [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md).
- **Simplicity**: Many find this approach easier to manage, as it provides clear [guidance](../g/guidance.md) on how to adjust portfolios over time.

## Tools and Products
There are specific financial products designed around the principles of lifecycle [investing](../i/investing.md):

1. **Target-Date Funds (TDFs)**: These are mutual funds or ETFs that automatically adjust [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) according to a predetermined [glide path](../g/glide_path.md) until a target retirement date. These funds start with a growth-oriented approach and gradually shift towards conservative investments as the target date approaches. Examples include the Vanguard Target Retirement Funds and Fidelity Freedom Funds.

2. **Robo-Advisors**: Online platforms such as Betterment (www.betterment.com) and Wealthfront (www.wealthfront.com) use algorithms to create and adjust portfolios based on lifecycle [investing](../i/investing.md) principles and individual [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md).

## Academic and Practical Support
Lifecycle [investing](../i/investing.md) is supported by both academic research and practical application:

- **Research**: Books such as "Lifecycle [Investing](../i/investing.md)" by Ian Ayres and Barry Nalebuff provide an in-depth look at the rationale and methodologies behind this strategy.
  
- **Financial Institutions**: Many financial advisors and institutions [offer](../o/offer.md) lifecycle [investing](../i/investing.md) advice and products. For instance, Vanguard (www.vanguard.com) offers personalized investment advice incorporating lifecycle principles.

## Challenges and Criticisms
While lifecycle [investing](../i/investing.md) has many benefits, it also faces some criticisms:

- **Assumptions of Stability**: The strategy often assumes life events and [market](../m/market.md) conditions [will](../w/will.md) follow a somewhat predictable path, which may not always be the case.
  
- **Inflexibility**: The pre-set glide paths in products like TDFs might not account for individual circumstances such as varying financial goals or [risk](../r/risk.md) tolerances.

- **Cost**: Some lifecycle investment products, like TDFs, may come with higher fees compared to custom portfolios.

## Conclusion
Lifecycle [investing](../i/investing.md) is a strategic approach to managing investments over one's lifetime, tailored to the individual's evolving [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) and financial objectives. By adjusting the [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) in alignment with the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s stage in life, this method aims to balance growth with [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), ultimately striving to secure financial stability and prepare for retirement.

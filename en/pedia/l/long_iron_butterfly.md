# Long Iron Butterfly

## Introduction

The Long [Iron Butterfly](../i/iron_butterfly.md) strategy is an advanced options trading strategy that combines elements of both the [Iron Condor](../i/iron_condor.md) and the [Butterfly Spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md). It is designed to profit from low volatility in the underlying asset, allowing traders to capitalize on price containment within a specific range. The strategy involves the simultaneous buying and selling of four options of the same underlying asset with three different strike prices. By understanding the mechanics of the Long [Iron Butterfly](../i/iron_butterfly.md), traders can better appreciate its benefits and risks.

## Basics of Options Trading

Before delving into the Long [Iron Butterfly](../i/iron_butterfly.md), it's crucial to have a foundational understanding of options trading. Options are financial [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) that provide the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined strike price before or at the expiry date. There are two primary types of options:

1. **Call Options**: These give the holder the right to buy the underlying asset.
2. **[Put Options](../p/put_options.md)**: These give the holder the right to sell the underlying asset.

## Structure of the Long Iron Butterfly

The Long [Iron Butterfly](../i/iron_butterfly.md) consists of four options contracts:
1. Long one lower strike put (buy a put option at strike price A).
2. Short two middle strike calls and puts (write both a call and a put option at strike price B).
3. Long one higher strike call (buy a call option at strike price C).

The general structure follows the format: Long Put @ Strike A, Short Put and Call @ Strike B, Long Call @ Strike C, where Strike A < Strike B < Strike C.

### Setting Up the Trade

1. **Select the Underlying Asset**: Choose a stock or index that you expect to have low volatility.
2. **Identify the Strike Prices and Expiration Dates**: Strike prices should be equidistant, and the expiration date should allow sufficient time for the strategy to play out.
3. **Execute the Contracts**: Buy one put at the lower strike price, sell one put and one call at the middle strike price, and buy one call at the higher strike price.

### Example Setup

Suppose a stock is trading at $100. A trader could set up a Long [Iron Butterfly](../i/iron_butterfly.md) as follows:

- Buy 1 $95 put (lower strike put)
- Sell 1 $100 put (middle strike put)
- Sell 1 $100 call (middle strike call)
- Buy 1 $105 call (higher strike call)

## Payoff Diagram

The payoff diagram of a Long [Iron Butterfly](../i/iron_butterfly.md) resembles a 'V' shape, inverted due to being "long." This profile indicates that maximum profit occurs if the underlying asset's price remains near the middle strike price (Strike B) at expiration, while maximum loss occurs if the price deviates significantly from the middle strike price.

### Maximum Profit

The maximum profit is achieved when the underlying asset's price is exactly at the middle strike price (Strike B) at expiration. The profit is calculated as:

\[ \text{Max Profit} = \text{Net Premium Received} \]

### Maximum Loss

The maximum loss occurs if the underlying asset's price falls below the lower strike price (Strike A) or rises above the higher strike price (Strike C). The loss is calculated as:

\[ \text{Max Loss} = \text{Strike Width} - \text{Net Premium Received} \]

Where Strike Width = Strike C - Strike A

## Advantages of the Long Iron Butterfly

1. **Profit from Low Volatility**: The strategy is optimal when the underlying asset's price remains within a narrow range.
2. **Limited Risk**: Both maximum loss and maximum gain are predefined, allowing for effective [risk management](../r/risk_management.md).
3. **Cost Efficiency**: Compared to buying a stock outright, the Long [Iron Butterfly](../i/iron_butterfly.md) requires a lower initial investment.

## Disadvantages of the Long Iron Butterfly

1. **Limited Profit Potential**: While the risk is limited, so is the profit potential, which is confined to the net premium received.
2. **Complex Execution**: Involves multiple legs which can be confusing for beginners and usually incurs higher transaction costs.
3. **Sensitivity to Small Price Movements**: The strategy can suffer if the underlying asset's price makes minor unexpected movements.

## Risk Management

Effective [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) is critical in options trading, and the Long [Iron Butterfly](../i/iron_butterfly.md) is no exception. Consider the following tips:

1. **Monitor Volatility**: Keep an eye on implied volatility, as fluctuations can significantly affect strategy performance.
2. **Set [Stop-Loss Orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md)**: Predefine exit points to minimize losses if the market moves unfavorably.
3. **Adjust Positions**: If the market environment changes, consider closing the position early or adjusting one or more legs to better align with the new conditions.

## Comparing Long Iron Butterfly with Other Strategies

### Butterfly Spread

- **Similarity**: Both involve a combination of calls and puts and aim to benefit from low volatility.
- **Difference**: The [Butterfly Spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md) uses only calls or only puts, while the Long [Iron Butterfly](../i/iron_butterfly.md) uses both.

### Iron Condor

- **Similarity**: Both involve buying and selling calls and puts at different strike prices.
- **Difference**: [Iron Condor](../i/iron_condor.md) requires four different strike prices and is typically not as sensitive to the underlying asset price as the Long [Iron Butterfly](../i/iron_butterfly.md).

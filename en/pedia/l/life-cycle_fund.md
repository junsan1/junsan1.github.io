# Life-Cycle Fund

A Life-Cycle [Fund](../f/fund.md), also known as a Target Date [Fund](../f/fund.md) or Age-Based [Fund](../f/fund.md), is a type of [investment fund](../i/investment_fund.md) designed to automatically adjust its [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) as the [investor](../i/investor.md) approaches a specific target date, typically retirement. This type of [fund](../f/fund.md) is structured to be a one-stop solution for individuals who prefer to set an investment course and leave the decisions to professional [fund](../f/fund.md) managers. The core idea is to start with a more aggressive allocation early in the investment [life cycle](../l/life_cycle.md), progressively shifting to a more conservative allocation as the target date nears. This shift aims to minimize [risk](../r/risk.md) as the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s need for [principal](../p/principal.md) protection increases.

## Key Characteristics

### Target Date
The primary feature of a Life-Cycle [Fund](../f/fund.md) is its target date, which is the approximate year when an [investor](../i/investor.md) plans to start withdrawing the investment for retirement. The target date is used as a key parameter to determine how the [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) changes over time.

### Glide Path
The [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) strategy of a Life-Cycle [Fund](../f/fund.md) is governed by a trajectory known as the "[glide path](../g/glide_path.md)." The [glide path](../g/glide_path.md) becomes more conservative over time, moving from a greater proportion of high-[risk](../r/risk.md), high-reward investments (like [stocks](../s/stock.md)) to lower-[risk](../r/risk.md) investments (like bonds and [cash equivalents](../c/cash_equivalents.md)).

### Professional Management
Life-Cycle Funds are managed by professional [fund](../f/fund.md) managers who make the critical decisions about [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) shifts. Investors benefit from the expertise of seasoned professionals without having to actively manage their investment portfolios themselves.

### Diversification
These funds are inherently diversified as they invest in a mix of [asset](../a/asset.md) classes such as domestic and international [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, and sometimes alternative investments. [Diversification](../d/diversification.md) helps in reducing the overall [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Rebalancing
Life-Cycle Funds are periodically rebalanced to realign the portfolio with its strategic [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md). This automatic [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) ensures that the [fund](../f/fund.md) remains on its [glide path](../g/glide_path.md).

## Mechanism of Operation

Life-Cycle Funds usually operate on a formulaic approach, adjusting the mix of assets based on the number of years remaining until the target date. Here's how the allocation typically changes:

1. **Early Years (Long before the target date)**:
   - High allocation to equities ([stocks](../s/stock.md)) 
   - Low allocation to [fixed income](../f/fixed_income.md) (bonds)
   - Minimal cash or [cash equivalents](../c/cash_equivalents.md)

2. **Mid-Years (Intermediate period before the target date)**:
   - Gradually decreasing allocation to equities
   - Increasing allocation to [fixed income](../f/fixed_income.md)
   - Introduction of more conservative investment [options](../o/options.md)

3. **Later Years (Approaching and post-target date)**:
   - Low allocation to equities
   - High allocation to [fixed income](../f/fixed_income.md)
   - Increased allocation to [cash equivalents](../c/cash_equivalents.md)
   
## Advantages

### Simplification
Life-Cycle Funds [offer](../o/offer.md) a simplified [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) for individuals who might not have the time, knowledge, or inclination to manage their portfolios actively. 

### Automatic Adjustment
The automatic adjustment of the [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) is one of the standout benefits. This means that investors don’t have to worry about altering their investment mix themselves.

### Risk Management
By shifting to more conservative investments over time, Life-Cycle Funds aim to minimize the [risk](../r/risk.md) as the [investor](../i/investor.md) gets closer to the [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) phase.

### Professional Oversight
The involvement of professional [fund](../f/fund.md) managers ensures that the [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) adjustments are made based on extensive research and [market](../m/market.md) analysis.

### Discourages Market Timing
Investors are less likely to engage in [market timing](../m/market_timing.md)—buying and selling based on [market](../m/market.md) conditions—when they invest through Life-Cycle Funds. This typically results in a more disciplined investment approach.

## Drawbacks

### Lack of Customization
One size does not fit all. The [glide path](../g/glide_path.md) might not perfectly match every [investor](../i/investor.md)'s unique financial situation, [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md), or retirement goals.

### Fees
Life-Cycle Funds might come with higher fees compared to other types of funds due to the [active management](../a/active_management.md) involved. These fees can erode returns over time.

### Potential for Lower Returns
As the [fund](../f/fund.md) becomes more conservative, the potential for higher returns decreases, which might not be ideal for investors who can tolerate more [risk](../r/risk.md) or who have other sources of [income](../i/income.md) for retirement.

### Inflexibility
Some investors might want more control over their [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md), which is not possible with a Life-Cycle [Fund](../f/fund.md). This inflexibility could be a drawback for more sophisticated investors.

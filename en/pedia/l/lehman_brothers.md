# Lehman Brothers

Lehman Brothers was a global financial services [firm](../f/firm.md) that, for over 150 years, was considered one of the most influential firms in the financial world. Founded in 1850, Lehman Brothers had a storied history that included its role in the development of the U.S. [financial system](../f/financial_system.md), surviving [multiple](../m/multiple.md) financial crises, and [investing](../i/investing.md) in various industries. However, its abrupt [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) in 2008 marked one of the most significant events in the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) of 2007-2008, highlighting systemic risks in global [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and leading to widespread economic repercussions.

## Early History
Lehman Brothers was founded by Henry Lehman, a German immigrant, in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1850. Initially, the [firm](../f/firm.md) was a dry-goods store, but it soon transitioned into trading cotton, a vital [commodity](../c/commodity.md) at the time. The [firm](../f/firm.md)'s involvement in the cotton [trade](../t/trade.md) marked the beginning of its transformation into a financial service [firm](../f/firm.md).

Over the next few decades, Lehman Brothers expanded its operations into banking, focusing on [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) and issuing securities. The [firm](../f/firm.md) moved to New York City to be closer to the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and became a member of the New York Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) in 1887.

## Expansion and Growth
During the early 20th century, Lehman Brothers played a vital role in the growth of several emerging industries, including aviation, motion pictures, and retail. The [firm](../f/firm.md) underwrote initial public offerings (IPOs) for many prominent corporations, helping to [finance](../f/finance.md) their [expansion](../e/expansion.md). Some notable companies that Lehman backed include Macyâ€™s and B.F. Goodrich.

Lehman Brothers survived the [Great Depression](../g/great_depression.md) in the 1930s, showcasing its resilience. Throughout the mid-20th century, the [firm](../f/firm.md) continued to diversify its services, including [commercial paper](../c/commercial_paper.md), managing high-grade securities, and providing financial advisory services.

## Merger and Global Expansion
In 1984, Lehman Brothers merged with Kuhn, Loeb & Co., another well-established financial [firm](../f/firm.md), creating one of the largest [investment banks](../i/investment_bank_(ib).md) in the United States. This [merger](../m/merger.md) allowed Lehman Brothers to increase its [capital](../c/capital.md) base and strengthen its global presence.

Lehman Brothers' strategy during the late 20th and early 21st century focused on expanding its global footprint. It opened offices in major financial centers around the world, including London, Tokyo, and Hong Kong. The [firm](../f/firm.md) became known for its expertise in fixed-[income](../i/income.md) sales and trading, [equity research](../e/equity_research.md), [investment management](../i/investment_management.md), and [private equity](../p/private_equity.md).

## Role in the Subprime Mortgage Market
During the early 2000s, Lehman Brothers, along with many other financial institutions, aggressively expanded into the [subprime mortgage](../s/subprime_mortgage.md) [market](../m/market.md). Subprime mortgages were loans given to borrowers with lower [credit](../c/credit.md) ratings, often with higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and less favorable terms. [Investing](../i/investing.md) heavily in [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-backed securities (MBS) and collateralized [debt](../d/debt.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md) (CDOs) tied to these subprime loans proved to be highly [lucrative](../l/lucrative.md) initially, as the U.S. housing [market](../m/market.md) was booming.

However, as housing prices began to fall in 2006, the flaws in these high-[risk](../r/risk.md) investments were exposed. Subprime borrowers began to [default](../d/default.md) on their loans at an increasing rate, leading to a sharp decline in the [value](../v/value.md) of MBS and CDOs. Financial institutions with significant exposure to these securities, including Lehman Brothers, faced substantial losses.

## The Fall: 2008 Financial Crisis
By 2007, the [financial distress](../f/financial_distress.md) caused by the [subprime mortgage](../s/subprime_mortgage.md) crisis was becoming evident. Lehman Brothers reported multi-billion-dollar losses and [writedowns](../w/writedowns_in_trading.md). Their heavy reliance on [leverage](../l/leverage.md) (borrowing to invest) exacerbated the situation, as falling [asset](../a/asset.md) prices forced Lehman to meet increasing [margin](../m/margin.md) calls from creditors.

On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for [Chapter 11 bankruptcy](../c/chapter_11_bankruptcy.md) protection. With $639 billion in assets and $619 billion in [debt](../d/debt.md), it was the largest [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) filing in U.S. history at that time. The failure of Lehman Brothers sent shockwaves through global [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), contributing to the most severe [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) since the [Great Depression](../g/great_depression.md).

### Aftermath and Systemic Impact
The collapse of Lehman Brothers had widespread and far-reaching effects:
- **[Market](../m/market.md) Turbulence**: [Stocks](../s/stock.md) plummeted and [credit](../c/credit.md) markets froze as investors lost confidence in the stability of financial institutions.
- **[Liquidity Crisis](../l/liquidity_crisis.md)**: Lehman's [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) caused a severe [liquidity crisis](../l/liquidity_crisis.md), as financial firms with exposure to Lehman faced massive losses, leading to a [credit](../c/credit.md) crunch.
- **Government Intervention**: The U.S. government and Federal Reserve took unprecedented steps to stabilize the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md), including the TARP (Troubled [Asset](../a/asset.md) Relief Program) and the bailouts of other financial institutions.
- **Regulatory Reforms**: The [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) led to significant regulatory changes, such as the [Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act](../d/dodd-frank_wall_street_reform_and_consumer_protection_act.md), aimed at increasing [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and reducing systemic risks in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

## Conclusion
Lehman Brothers' [rise and fall](../r/rise_fall.md) serve as a classic example of the risks inherent in the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md), particularly related to [leverage](../l/leverage.md), [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), and the interconnectedness of global markets. Its collapse underscored the need for [robust](../r/robust.md) regulatory frameworks and prudent [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices to maintain financial stability. The legacy of Lehman Brothers continues to influence financial policies and the operations of financial institutions worldwide.

# Levered Free Cash Flow (LFCF)

Levered Free [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md) (LFCF) is an essential concept in [finance](../f/finance.md), especially relevant for investors, analysts, and financial professionals. It represents the amount of cash a company produces after meeting its financial [obligations](../o/obligation.md), including [interest](../i/interest.md) and [debt](../d/debt.md) repayments. It is an insightful measure that helps in assessing a company's [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and its ability to generate cash from its [business](../b/business.md) operations after [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for [capital](../c/capital.md) expenditures and [debt](../d/debt.md) servicing costs.

## Understanding Levered Free Cash Flow (LFCF)

To understand LFCF, it's crucial first to comprehend Free [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md) (FCF). Free [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md), in general, represents the cash generated by a company that is available for [distribution](../d/distribution.md) among all the company's [security](../s/security.md) holders. Levered Free [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md), on the other hand, incorporates the effect of [debt](../d/debt.md) and [interest](../i/interest.md) payments, making it a more accurate reflection of the cash available to [equity](../e/equity.md) shareholders.

### Formula

The formula to calculate Levered Free [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md) is:

`LFCF = Net [Income](../i/income.md) + Non-Cash Charges ([Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) & Amortization) - Change in Working [Capital](../c/capital.md) - [Capital](../c/capital.md) Expenditures - [Debt](../d/debt.md) Repayments`

Alternatively, it can also be calculated as:

`LFCF = Free [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md) (FCF) - [Interest](../i/interest.md) Payments - Mandatory [Debt](../d/debt.md) Payments`

Where:
- Net [Income](../i/income.md) is the [profit](../p/profit.md) of the company after all expenses, [taxes](../t/taxes.md), and costs.
- Non-Cash Charges include [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) and amortization expenses, which impact net [income](../i/income.md) but do not involve actual cash outflows.
- Change in Working [Capital](../c/capital.md) considers the variations in the company’s [current assets](../c/current_assets.md) and [current liabilities](../c/current_liabilities.md).
- [Capital](../c/capital.md) Expenditures (CapEx) are the funds used by the company to acquire, [upgrade](../u/upgrade.md), and maintain physical assets such as property, buildings, or equipment.
- [Interest](../i/interest.md) Payments are the costs incurred by the company for borrowing funds.
- [Debt](../d/debt.md) Repayments are the [principal](../p/principal.md) amount of [debt](../d/debt.md) repaid during the period.

### Analysis

Analyzing LFCF provides insight into several critical factors of a company's [financial health](../f/financial_health.md):

1. **[Debt](../d/debt.md) Servicing Ability**: LFCF indicates how well a company can service its [debt](../d/debt.md) using the cash it generates from its core operations. A positive LFCF means the company can cover its [debt](../d/debt.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md) while a negative LFCF might indicate potential [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) issues.

2. **[Equity](../e/equity.md) [Value](../v/value.md)**: For [equity](../e/equity.md) investors, LFCF is an [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of the cash truly available to them after all [debt](../d/debt.md)-related costs have been settled.

3. **[Capital Allocation](../c/capital_allocation.md) and [Efficiency](../e/efficiency.md)**: LFCF reflects the [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) of a company's [capital allocation](../c/capital_allocation.md) strategies. Efficient [capital expenditure](../c/capital_expenditure.md) planning and optimal [working capital management](../w/working_capital_management.md) contribute to higher LFCF.

4. **Investment Decisions**: Investors and analysts use LFCF to decide on potential investments in the company. Positive and stable LFCF trends are considered favorable.

## Comparison with Unlevered Free Cash Flow (UFCF)

While Levered Free [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md) accounts for [interest](../i/interest.md) and [principal](../p/principal.md) repayments, Unlevered Free [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md) (UFCF) measures the [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) to the [firm](../f/firm.md) before taking into account any [debt](../d/debt.md)-related expenses. UFCF represents the cash available to both [debt](../d/debt.md) and [equity](../e/equity.md) holders and is used in enterprise [valuation models](../v/valuation_models.md). 

### Formula for UFCF

`UFCF = EBIT (1 - [Tax Rate](../t/tax_rate.md)) + Non-Cash Charges - Change in Working [Capital](../c/capital.md) - CapEx`

Where:
- EBIT is [Earnings](../e/earnings.md) Before [Interest](../i/interest.md) and [Taxes](../t/taxes.md).

The distinction between LFCF and UFCF lies chiefly in their treatment of [debt](../d/debt.md) and [interest](../i/interest.md) payments, making UFCF relevant for all stakeholders, while LFCF is more specific to [equity](../e/equity.md) holders.

## Levered Free Cash Flow in Financial Modelling

In financial modelling, LFCF is an integral part of [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) analysis. Analysts construct detailed financial models to forecast a company’s [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) and derive an estimate of its [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md).

### Steps to Model LFCF

1. **[Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Projections**: Estimate future revenues based on historical performance, [market](../m/market.md) trends, and company-specific factors.
2. **[Expense](../e/expense.md) Estimations**: Predict future operating expenses, including Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&A) expenses.
3. **Non-Cash Adjustments**: Adjust for non-cash charges like [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) and amortization.
4. **Working [Capital](../c/capital.md) Forecasts**: Project changes in working [capital](../c/capital.md).
5. **[Capital](../c/capital.md) Expenditures**: Estimate future [capital expenditure](../c/capital_expenditure.md) requirements.
6. **[Debt](../d/debt.md) Servicing**: Include schedules for [interest](../i/interest.md) and [principal](../p/principal.md) repayments.

By projecting these components forward, a comprehensive view of LFCF over the forecast period can be achieved.

## Importance in Valuation

Levered Free [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md) is pivotal in [valuation](../v/valuation.md), particularly in [equity valuation models](../e/equity_valuation_models.md) like the Levered Discounted [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md) (LDCF) model. The LDCF model discounts future LFCF at the [cost of equity](../c/cost_of_equity.md) to arrive at the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of [equity](../e/equity.md). 

## Real-World Applications and Examples

LFCF is used extensively in various financial analyses and reports, from corporate [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md) to investment research. 

### Example in Practice

For instance, consider a hypothetical company, XYZ Corp, with the following annual financial details:

- **Net [Income](../i/income.md)**: $100 million
- **[Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) & Amortization**: $20 million
- **Change in Working [Capital](../c/capital.md)**: -$5 million
- **CapEx**: $30 million
- **[Interest](../i/interest.md) Payments**: $10 million
- **[Debt](../d/debt.md) Repayments**: $15 million

Using the LFCF formula:

`LFCF = 100 + 20 - (-5) - 30 - 15`
`LFCF = 80 million`

This indicates that XYZ Corp has $80 million in levered free [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) available after meeting its financial [obligations](../o/obligation.md).

## Conclusion

Levered Free [Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md) is a [robust](../r/robust.md) financial metric that provides deep insights into a company’s real cash-generating capability after [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for [debt](../d/debt.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md). By understanding and analyzing LFCF, stakeholders can make informed decisions regarding investment, [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) assessment, and strategic planning. Whether used in isolation or in conjunction with other financial metrics, LFCF offers vital information that contributes to a holistic view of a company's [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) and potential.

# Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act

The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 is a significant legislation in the history of the United States labor law. It seeks to address and rectify instances of wage discrimination on the bases of gender, race, age, ethnicity, religion, and national origin. Named after Lilly Ledbetter, whose case against the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. highlighted discrepancies in pay based on gender, the Act was designed to ensure that victims of pay discrimination have a fair chance to file claims and that justice is served.

## Definition
The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was signed into law on January 29, 2009, by President Barack Obama. It amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964, overturning the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., and essentially resets the deadline for filing a pay discrimination claim with each new discriminatory paycheck.

### Key Provisions
1. **Amendment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964**: The Act modifies Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, allowing the 180-day statute of limitations for filing an equal-pay lawsuit regarding pay discrimination to reset with each new paycheck that reflects discriminatory pay.
2. **Scope of the Act**: It applies not only to sex-based wage discrimination but also encompasses discrimination based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, and disability.
3. **Interactive Time Frame**: The Act provides that the statute of limitations for filing pay discrimination lawsuits resets with each discriminatory paycheck. This means that employees have a longer time period to discover and act upon wage discrepancies.

## History
### The Case of Lilly Ledbetter
Lilly Ledbetter was an employee at Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.'s Gadsden, Alabama plant, where she worked from 1979 until her retirement in 1998. Over her nearly 20-year career, Ledbetter alleged that she received lower pay than her male counterparts. She initially filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which led to a lawsuit in federal court.

### Supreme Court Decision
Ledbetter's case eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court in 2007. In a 5-4 decision, the Court ruled that Ledbetter's claim of pay discrimination was time-barred because it was filed outside the 180-day statutory filing period. The Court held that the statute of limitations started when the pay-setting decision was made, not when the employee received the paycheck reflecting the discrimination.

### Legislative Response
The Supreme Court's decision was widely criticized for not considering the ongoing nature of pay discrimination, which often remains hidden due to the confidentiality of salary information in many organizations. This decision prompted legislative action, leading to the introduction of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act in both the House and Senate. The Act was passed by Congress and signed into law shortly after President Obama took office in 2009.

## Impact
### Legal Impact
1. **Resetting the Statute of Limitations**: By resetting the 180-day statute of limitations with each discriminatory paycheck, the Act allows individuals facing pay discrimination more time to file lawsuits and challenge discriminatory practices.
2. **Broader Protection**: The Act covers various forms of discrimination beyond gender, including race, age, disability, religion, and national origin, thereby providing a comprehensive framework for addressing pay discrimination.
3. **Fair Legal Recourse**: Employees now have a better chance of gaining legal recourse for discriminatory pay decisions, even if they were unaware of the disparity for a lengthy period.

### Societal Impact
1. **Empowerment of Employees**: The Act empowers employees to speak up against wage discrimination without fear of untimely dismissal of their claims due to statutory limitations.
2. **Increased Awareness**: The passage of the Act has increased awareness about wage discrimination issues and encouraged more transparency in pay practices within organizations.
3. **Encouraging Fair Pay Practices**: It serves as a deterrent against discriminatory pay practices and promotes fair pay across industries.

### Case Studies
Several significant cases have followed the enactment of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, further establishing its importance in labor law and wage equality.

#### Example 1: U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Freudenberg-NOK, General Partnership (2015)
The EEOC sued Freudenberg-NOK, General Partnership, alleging that the company engaged in gender-based pay discrimination. The case was instrumental because it reaffirmed the principles set by the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, ensuring that each paycheck reflecting discriminatory pay restarted the statute of limitations.

#### Example 2: King v. Hewlett-Packard Company (2013)
In this case, Hewlett-Packard was alleged to have engaged in discriminatory pay and promotion practices against female employees. The plaintiffs utilized the provisions of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to substantiate their claims and file within the appropriate timeframe, showcasing the Act's utility in combating ongoing discriminatory policies.

## Conclusion
The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act stands as a landmark piece of legislation aimed at promoting wage equality and addressing systemic pay discrimination. By resetting the statute of limitations with each discriminatory paycheck, it provides a fair chance for employees to challenge unjust pay practices. The Act represents a significant step forward in the fight for equal pay and serves as a powerful tool for employees to ensure their rights are protected in the workplace.

# Libor Futures

Libor [futures](../f/futures.md) are financial contracts that enable traders to bet on or [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against future movements in the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). These contracts are fundamental to the world of [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) trading and are commonly used by a variety of [market](../m/market.md) participants, including banks, [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds, and other financial institutions.

## Introduction to Libor

Libor, or the London Interbank Offered Rate, is a global [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) used to set the cost of borrowing between banks. It is calculated and published daily by the Intercontinental [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (ICE) and serves as a [reference rate](../r/reference_rate.md) for various financial products, including loans, mortgages, and [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md). Libor is derived from a panel of major global banks, which submit their borrowing costs in different currencies and maturities, ranging from overnight to one year.

Libor is published in the following five currencies:
- USD (United States Dollar)
- EUR ([Euro](../e/euro.md))
- GBP (British Pound)
- JPY (Japanese Yen)
- CHF (Swiss Franc)

It is also calculated for seven different maturities: overnight, one week, and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months.

## What are Libor Futures?

Libor [futures](../f/futures.md) are standardized, [exchange](../e/exchange.md)-traded contracts that represent the future [value](../v/value.md) of Libor. These financial [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) allow traders to speculate on or [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against changes in Libor without physically borrowing or lending [money](../m/money.md). They are predominantly traded on the Chicago Mercantile [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (CME) and are used to manage short-term [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) risks.

### Characteristics of Libor Futures

1. **Contract Specifications**: 
    - **Contract Size**: Typically, each contract covers a [principal](../p/principal.md) amount, such as $1 million for USD Libor.
    - **Contract Months**: These [futures](../f/futures.md) are available for quarterly contract months (March, June, September, December) and can extend up to several years in the future.
    - **Pricing**: [Futures](../f/futures.md) prices are quoted as 100 minus the three-month [Libor rate](../l/libor_rate_analysis.md). For example, if the three-month Libor is 2.5%, the [futures](../f/futures.md) price would be 97.5.

2. **Settlement**: 
    - **Cash Settlement**: Unlike some [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) that may require the delivery of a physical [asset](../a/asset.md), Libor [futures](../f/futures.md) are cash-settled. This means that at expiration, the contract is settled in cash based on the difference between the contract price and the actual [Libor rate](../l/libor_rate_analysis.md).

3. **Expiration and Final Settlement**: 
    - **Final Settlement Date**: Libor [futures](../f/futures.md) settle on the third Wednesday of the contract month. The final settlement price is determined by taking the arithmetic average of the three-month Libor rates observed over a determined period before the settlement date.

## Trading Libor Futures

### Market Participants

Libor [futures](../f/futures.md) attract a wide [range](../r/range.md) of [market](../m/market.md) participants:
- **Speculators**: Traders looking to [profit](../p/profit.md) from anticipated changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.
- **Hedgers**: Financial institutions and corporations using [futures](../f/futures.md) to manage exposure to [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) fluctuations.
- **Arbitrageurs**: Participants exploiting price discrepancies between Libor [futures](../f/futures.md) and other related [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) instruments.

### Trading Mechanics

1. **Placing Orders**: Orders for Libor [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) are placed through brokers or electronic trading platforms connected to the CME.
2. **[Leverage](../l/leverage.md)**: [Futures](../f/futures.md) trading typically involves [leverage](../l/leverage.md), meaning that traders can control large positions with a relatively small amount of [capital](../c/capital.md). This magnifies both potential gains and losses.
3. **[Margin](../m/margin.md) Requirements**: Traders must post [initial margin](../i/initial_margin.md) [collateral](../c/collateral.md) to enter positions and may need to meet [variation margin](../v/variation_margin.md) calls if the [market](../m/market.md) moves against their positions.

### Strategies

Various strategies can be employed when trading Libor [futures](../f/futures.md):

- **[Speculation](../s/speculation.md)**: Traders take long (buy) or short (sell) positions based on their expectations for future Libor movements.
- **Hedging**: Institutions might use Libor [futures](../f/futures.md) to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md) associated with their portfolios of loans, deposits, or other [interest](../i/interest.md)-sensitive items.
- **[Spread Trading](../s/spread_trading.md)**: Involves taking offsetting positions in different contract maturities to [profit](../p/profit.md) from changes in the [yield curve](../y/yield_curve.md).

## Libor Transition

The Libor [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) is in the process of being phased out due to concerns about its reliability and susceptibility to manipulation. Regulatory authorities have identified alternative reference rates, such as the Secured Overnight [Financing](../f/financing.md) Rate (SOFR) in the United States, to replace Libor.

### Impact on Libor Futures

The transition from Libor to alternative rates has significant implications for Libor [futures](../f/futures.md) markets:
- **Contract Modification**: Existing Libor [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) may be modified to reference the new [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) rates.
- **New Instruments**: New [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) based on alternative rates such as SOFR have been introduced.
- **[Market](../m/market.md) Adaptation**: [Market](../m/market.md) participants are adjusting their strategies and hedging activities to the new reference rates.

## Conclusion

Libor [futures](../f/futures.md) are a critical tool for managing and speculating on short-term [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) changes. They [offer](../o/offer.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), [leverage](../l/leverage.md), and flexibility, making them a key component of the global [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). As the financial [industry](../i/industry.md) transitions away from Libor, the [market](../m/market.md) for [interest rate futures](../i/interest_rate_futures.md) [will](../w/will.md) continue to evolve, providing new opportunities and challenges for traders and institutions alike. For those involved in or considering entering the world of [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) trading, understanding Libor [futures](../f/futures.md) and their impending changes is crucial.

# Layaway in Retail Business

Layaway is a purchasing method often employed by retailers, where the buyer reserves an item for later pickup by placing a [deposit](../d/deposit.md). This shopping strategy became popular before the widespread use of [credit](../c/credit.md) cards and remains a viable option for those who prefer to avoid [interest](../i/interest.md) charges and [debt](../d/debt.md). Layaway offers several benefits, including budgeting flexibility, [interest](../i/interest.md)-free purchasing, and reserved items for future purchase.

## How Layaway Works

Layaway programs typically follow a standard procedure:

1. **Selection**: The [customer](../c/customer.md) selects the item(s) they wish to purchase.
2. **[Deposit](../d/deposit.md)**: The retailer requires a [deposit](../d/deposit.md), often a percentage of the total purchase price. This initial [payment](../p/payment.md) may also include a service [fee](../f/fee.md).
3. **[Payment](../p/payment.md) Plan**: The [customer](../c/customer.md) makes periodic payments over a specified period.
4. **Storage**: The retailer stores the item(s) until the final [payment](../p/payment.md) is made.
5. **Pickup**: Once the [customer](../c/customer.md) completes all payments, they can pick up their purchase.

## Key Elements of a Layaway Program

### Deposit

The initial [deposit](../d/deposit.md) is crucial for reserving the item and is usually nonrefundable. It demonstrates the [customer](../c/customer.md)'s commitment to the purchase and covers any administrative costs the retailer may incur.

### Service Fees

Retailers may charge a service [fee](../f/fee.md) for layaway plans. This [fee](../f/fee.md) compensates the store for storage, handling, and administrative activities related to managing the program. However, some retailers may [offer](../o/offer.md) promotions with reduced or waived service fees during peak shopping seasons like the holidays.

### Payment Schedule

Customers typically agree to a regular [payment](../p/payment.md) schedule. Payments can be made weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly, depending on the retailer's policy. The flexibility in [payment](../p/payment.md) scheduling helps customers manage their finances better without accumulating [debt](../d/debt.md).

### Termination of Agreement

If the [customer](../c/customer.md) fails to complete the layaway payments within the agreed timeframe, the contract may be terminated. In such cases, the retailer might [return](../r/return.md) the payments made minus any service fees and restocking charges. The reserved item [will](../w/will.md) then become available for other customers.

## Advantages of Layaway

### Interest-Free Purchasing

One of the significant benefits of layaway is that it allows customers to purchase items without incurring [interest](../i/interest.md) charges, a common downside of [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) purchases.

### Budget Management

Layaway helps customers manage their budgets by allowing them to spread the cost of an item over an extended period, making it more affordable.

### Reserved Items

During high-[demand](../d/demand.md) periods, such as holiday shopping seasons, layaway ensures that customers can reserve popular items that are likely to sell out.

### Credit Not Required

Layaway is a viable option for individuals with poor or no [credit](../c/credit.md) history, as it does not require a [credit](../c/credit.md) [check](../c/check.md). This inclusivity makes it an attractive purchasing method for a broader [range](../r/range.md) of consumers.

## Disadvantages of Layaway

### Nonrefundable Deposits and Fees

Layaway plans typically involve nonrefundable deposits and service fees. Should the [customer](../c/customer.md) decide to cancel the layaway, these fees and deposits may not be returned.

### Storage Limitations

Retailers may limit the types of items eligible for layaway due to storage constraints. Bulkier items may be excluded from layaway programs.

### Cancellation Policies

Retailers can impose strict cancellation policies that may deter some customers. Failure to adhere to the [payment](../p/payment.md) schedule can result in the layaway contract's termination, with customers losing their deposits and fees.

## Evolution of Layaway

### Historical Perspective

Layaway programs gained traction during the [Great Depression](../g/great_depression.md) when consumers needed flexible purchasing [options](../o/options.md). It was prevalent before the advent of [consumer credit](../c/consumer_credit.md) cards, [offering](../o/offering.md) an alternative to on-the-spot cash payments.

### Modern Adaptations

In recent years, layaway programs have seen a resurgence, especially during economic downturns when consumers are more cautious about incurring [debt](../d/debt.md). Retail giants like Walmart and Kmart have revamped their layaway offerings to cater to contemporary shoppers' needs.

### Digital Layaway

The digital age has ushered in innovative layaway solutions. Some online retailers now [offer](../o/offer.md) "e-layaway" services, where customers can make payments online. This digitization removes geographical barriers and broadens accessibility.

## Layaway vs. Other Payment Methods

### Layaway vs. Credit Cards

Layaway offers a [debt](../d/debt.md)-free alternative to [credit](../c/credit.md) cards. While [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) users may enjoy immediate possession of their purchases, layaway ensures no [interest](../i/interest.md) charges accumulate, making it a cost-effective option.

### Layaway vs. Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)

Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) is a newer [payment](../p/payment.md) method allowing customers to split their purchases into several [interest](../i/interest.md)-free installments. Although similar to layaway, BNPL typically does not involve storing the item; the [customer](../c/customer.md) takes immediate possession of the purchase. Layaway, however, secures the item until full [payment](../p/payment.md) is made, which can be advantageous during periods of high [demand](../d/demand.md).

## Popular Retailers Offering Layaway

### Walmart

Walmart reintroduced its layaway program, mainly targeting holiday shoppers. The program typically runs from late summer to early winter, covering many product categories including electronics, toys, and [home](../h/home.md) goods.

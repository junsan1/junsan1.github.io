# Laggard

In the context of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and trading, a laggard is a stock or [security](../s/security.md) that underperforms the overall [market](../m/market.md) indices or its sector counterparts over a specific period. Laggards are often contrasted with leaders or outperformers, which are those [stocks](../s/stock.md) or securities that significantly outpace the broader [market](../m/market.md) or their sector peers.

## Definition and Characteristics

A laggard is characterized by its inability to keep pace with the general [market](../m/market.md) movements or with other [stocks](../s/stock.md) in its sector. Some of the key features that define a laggard include:

1. **Underperformance Relative to Benchmarks:**
   - The most defining characteristic of a laggard is its consistent underperformance relative to the broader [market index](../m/market_index.md) (e.g., S&P 500, [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md)) or sector-specific indices (e.g., technology, healthcare).
   
2. **Low [Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md):**
   - Laggards typically exhibit low [relative strength](../r/relative_strength.md), an [indicator](../i/indicator.md) used to compare a [security](../s/security.md)'s performance to a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md). A low [relative strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [index](../i/index.md) (RSI) suggests the stock is weaker compared to the broader [market](../m/market.md) [trend](../t/trend.md).

3. **[Investor](../i/investor.md) Sentiment:**
   - Laggards may suffer from poor [investor](../i/investor.md) sentiment due to various reasons including disappointing [earnings](../e/earnings.md) reports, negative news, or unfavorable [industry](../i/industry.md) trends. 

4. **Below-Average Growth:**
   - These [stocks](../s/stock.md) often show below-average growth metrics such as [revenue](../r/revenue.md) growth, [earnings](../e/earnings.md) growth, and [profit margins](../p/profit_margins_in_trading.md) compared to high-performing [stocks](../s/stock.md) in the same sector.

5. **Fundamental Weakness:**
   - A laggard may also be fundamentally weak, exhibiting lower [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) metrics like high [debt](../d/debt.md)-to-[equity](../e/equity.md) ratios, declining cash flows, and inferior management practices.

6. **Resistance to [Market](../m/market.md) Trends:**
   - While leaders might respond positively to bullish [market](../m/market.md) trends, laggards may remain stagnant or continue to decline, stubbornly resisting broad [market](../m/market.md) movements.

## Causes of Lagging Performance

Several factors can contribute to a stock becoming a laggard:

1. **[Industry](../i/industry.md) Cycles:**
   - Different industries and sectors go through cyclic phases of growth and decline. [Stocks](../s/stock.md) in a sector facing a downturn are likely to lag.
   
2. **Adverse Company-Specific News:**
   - Bad news, such as a product recall, regulatory issues, or legal problems, can negatively impact [investor](../i/investor.md) sentiment and cause a stock to [underperform](../u/underperform.md).

3. **[Earnings](../e/earnings.md) Misses:**
   - Consistent failure to meet [earnings estimates](../e/earnings_estimate.md) can turn a stock into a laggard as investors lose confidence in its growth prospects.

4. **Technological Disruption:**
   - Companies that [fail](../f/fail.md) to innovate or keep up with technological advances may fall behind competitors, turning them into laggards.

5. **Competitive Pressure:**
   - Increased competition in the marketplace can erode [market share](../m/market_share.md), leading to below-par performance for lagging companies.

## Strategies for Dealing With Laggards

For investors and traders, dealing with laggards involves making strategic decisions based on their investment goals and [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md). Here are some common strategies:

1. **Sell or Avoid Laggards:**
   - One straightforward approach is to sell lagging [stocks](../s/stock.md) to prevent further losses and reallocate [capital](../c/capital.md) into higher-performing securities.

2. **[Turnaround](../t/turnaround.md) Investment:**
   - Some investors might see potential in laggards turning around. Detailed [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md) and understanding [industry](../i/industry.md) trends can help identify [stocks](../s/stock.md) that might recover.

3. **Hedging:**
   - Using [options](../o/options.md) or short-selling strategies can help mitigate losses from laggards in a portfolio.

4. **[Rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) Portfolios:**
   - Regular [portfolio rebalancing](../p/portfolio_rebalancing.md) can help investors minimize exposure to laggards while aligning with their investment objectives.

5. **Use of ETFs:**
   - [Exchange](../e/exchange.md)-Traded Funds (ETFs) can help diversify exposure, reducing the impact of individual lagging [stocks](../s/stock.md).

## Examples of Notable Laggards

Over time, even some of the most well-known companies have found themselves in the laggard category due to various reasons. Here are a few historical examples:

1. **General Electric:**
   - Once a dominant force in [multiple](../m/multiple.md) sectors, GE struggled with consistent underperformance in the late 2010s due to over-[diversification](../d/diversification.md), mismanagement, and poor strategic decisions.

## Conclusion

Understanding the concept of laggards is essential for anyone involved in trading or investment. Identifying laggards involves a combination of [market](../m/market.md) analysis, understanding fundamental weaknesses, and monitoring economic and [industry](../i/industry.md) trends. Whether choosing to divest, [hedge](../h/hedge.md), or seek potential [turnaround](../t/turnaround.md) opportunities, handling laggards requires a strategic approach tailored to individual investment goals.

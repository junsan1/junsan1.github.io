# LIBOR Scandal

The LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) scandal is one of the most significant financial scandals in recent history, involving the manipulation of the London Interbank Offered Rate by major global banks. The scandal, which came to light in 2012, exposed how several institutions colluded to manipulate this [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) rate, which impacts trillions of dollars of financial contracts worldwide.

## Background

### What is LIBOR?

LIBOR is a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) at which major global banks lend to one another in the international [interbank market](../i/interbank_market.md) for short-term loans. It serves as a crucial [indicator](../i/indicator.md) for setting rates on a variety of financial products, including mortgages, student loans, and complex [financial derivatives](../f/financial_derivatives.md). LIBOR is published daily by the Intercontinental [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (ICE) and is calculated for five currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, and CHF) across seven different maturities, ranging from overnight to one year. The rate is derived from a survey of a panel of leading banks, where each [bank](../b/bank.md) reports the rate at which it believes it could borrow funds from other banks.

## The Mechanics of LIBOR

LIBOR is calculated by taking an average of the submitted rates from a designated panel of banks, discarding the highest and lowest 25% of responses, and then calculating the mean of the remaining values. This [trimmed mean](../t/trimmed_mean.md) helps to prevent manipulation by outliers but relies on the accuracy and honesty of the submitting banks.

## The Scandal Unfolds

### Revealing the Manipulation

The scandal came to public attention when it was revealed that [multiple](../m/multiple.md) banks had colluded to manipulate LIBOR submissions for their financial [gain](../g/gain.md). The manipulation occurred in two primary ways:

1. **[Profit](../p/profit.md) Motives**: Traders at various institutions colluded to submit artificially low or high rates to change the LIBOR according to their trading positions. By manipulating LIBOR, they aimed to increase the profitability of their own [derivative](../d/derivative.md) trades.
 
2. **Perception of Stability**: During the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) of 2007-2008, banks submitted falsely low rates to create an illusion of [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and stability. Reporting lower borrowing costs suggested that these institutions were more creditworthy than they actually were, thus maintaining [customer](../c/customer.md) confidence and avoiding panic in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

### Key Players Involved

Several major global financial institutions were implicated in the scandal, including:

- **Barclays**: One of the first banks to be charged, Barclays was fined $450 million by U.S. and U.K. regulators in 2012 after admitting to wrongdoing.
- **[UBS](../u/ubs.md)**: The Swiss [bank](../b/bank.md) [UBS](../u/ubs.md) faced penalties exceeding $1.5 billion and admitted to charges including [wire fraud](../w/wire_fraud.md).
- **Royal [Bank](../b/bank.md) of Scotland (RBS)**: RBS paid fines of around $610 million to settle charges.
- **Other Banks**: Institutions like Deutsche [Bank](../b/bank.md), JPMorgan Chase, and Citigroup were also implicated and faced massive fines and penalties.

## Investigations and Consequences

### Regulatory Response

The uncovering of the LIBOR scandal sparked a series of investigations by [multiple](../m/multiple.md) financial regulatory authorities around the world, including the U.S. [Commodity Futures](../c/commodity_futures.md) Trading [Commission](../c/commission.md) (CFTC), the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and the European [Commission](../c/commission.md). These investigations led to the identification of widespread malpractices and [collusion](../c/collusion.md) among traders and banks.

### Fines and Settlements

The repercussions of the LIBOR scandal were severe. Banks were collectively fined billions of dollars. For instance, Deutsche [Bank](../b/bank.md) faced a record $2.5 billion fine in 2015, while Barclays' settlement in 2012 included a penalty of Â£290 million.

### Criminal Charges and Reforms

In addition to financial penalties, the scandal resulted in criminal charges against individual traders and brokers. Several were prosecuted, facing trial and receiving prison sentences for their role in manipulating the rates. Notably, Tom Hayes, a former [trader](../t/trader.md) at [UBS](../u/ubs.md) and Citigroup, was sentenced to 14 years in prison in 2015, later reduced to 11 years on appeal.

The scandal also prompted significant reforms in how financial [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) rates are determined. Regulatory authorities introduced new policies to increase [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and accuracy, including more [robust](../r/robust.md) oversight and compliance measures.

### Replacement of LIBOR

One of the most impactful outcomes of the scandal has been the decision to gradually phase out LIBOR entirely. Recognizing the intrinsic issues related to the self-reporting mechanism, regulators globally agreed to transition to alternative reference rates. For instance:

- **SOFR (Secured Overnight [Financing](../f/financing.md) Rate)**: The preferred alternative in the U.S. for USD LIBOR.
- **SONIA (Sterling Overnight [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) Average)**: The replacement for GBP LIBOR.
- **ESTER ([Euro](../e/euro.md) Short-Term Rate)**: Used to replace EUR LIBOR.

These new benchmarks are based on actual [transaction](../t/transaction.md) data rather than self-reported rates, aimed at preventing future manipulations and ensuring greater integrity in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

## Implications for Financial Markets

### Economic and Market Impact

The manipulation of LIBOR impacted a wide array of financial instruments. Trillions of dollars in loans, mortgages, and [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) were directly tied to LIBOR rates. The artificially altered rates led to distorted pricing, which benefitted some parties while disadvantaging others. For consumers, this meant paying different [interest](../i/interest.md) rates on loans and mortgages than they should have, effectively subsidizing the profits of the manipulating traders.

### Loss of Trust

The LIBOR scandal significantly eroded public [trust](../t/trust.md) in the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md). It revealed how pervasive unethical behavior and [collusion](../c/collusion.md) were among supposedly reputable financial institutions. The scandal highlighted the urgent need for better oversight and regulation to restore confidence.

### Regulatory and Industry Reforms

In response to the scandal, there has been a marked shift towards more stringent regulatory frameworks. Institutions have tightened their [internal controls](../i/internal_controls.md), compliance practices have been bolstered, and there is a greater emphasis on ethical behavior within the financial [industry](../i/industry.md). Regulatory bodies also increased their scrutiny of financial benchmarks, implementing reforms to make these benchmarks more [robust](../r/robust.md) and less susceptible to manipulation.

## Future Outlook

### Transition to Alternative Rates

The full transition away from LIBOR is expected to be complete by the end of 2021, with all legacy contracts required to transition to the new benchmarks by 2023. This monumental shift involves reworking contracts, adjusting financial systems, and educating stakeholders about the new rates. Despite the challenges, this move aims to create a more stable, transparent, and reliable [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) system.

### Continuing Vigilance

While the measures taken post-scandal are promising, continuous vigilance is necessary. The financial world is complex and fast-evolving, and new vulnerabilities constantly emerge. Regulators, financial institutions, and [market](../m/market.md) participants must remain proactive in identifying and mitigating potential risks to prevent a recurrence of similar scandals.

### Lessons Learned

The LIBOR scandal serves as a stark reminder of the importance of ethical behavior, [robust](../r/robust.md) regulation, and [transparency](../t/transparency.md) in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). It underscores the need for ongoing reforms to foster a culture of integrity and accountability, ensuring that financial benchmarks reflect true [market](../m/market.md) conditions and serve the interests of all participants fairly.

## Conclusion

The LIBOR scandal marks a defining moment in financial history, encapsulating how systemic vulnerabilities, coupled with unethical behavior, can severely distort global markets. It led to substantial fines, criminal charges, and a comprehensive overhaul of the financial [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) system. The transition to alternative rates represents a collective effort to build a more trustworthy and resilient financial [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md). Moving forward, the lessons from the LIBOR scandal [will](../w/will.md) continue to shape regulatory policies and [market](../m/market.md) practices, striving to [uphold](../u/uphold.md) the integrity and stability of the global [financial system](../f/financial_system.md).

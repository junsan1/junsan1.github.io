# Listed Security

A listed security is a financial instrument that is traded on a formally recognized stock exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Nasdaq, the London Stock Exchange (LSE), or any other exchange that maintains strict listing requirements. The process of listing a security involves meeting specific standards set by the exchange, which ensures that only companies of sufficient worth and transparency gain access to these trading platforms.

## What is a Listed Security?

Listed securities encompass a variety of financial instruments including stocks (common and preferred), bonds, and other types of assets. The listing process means that the issuing entity, often a corporation, adheres to the regulations and requirements prescribed by the stock exchange. As a result, being listed enhances the credibility and visibility of the security.

## Requirements for Listing

The specific requirements for listing can vary between exchanges but generally include:

1. **Financial Standards:** The company must have a certain amount of net tangible assets, market capitalization, and earnings.
2. **Corporate Governance:** Compliance with governance practices, including board structure and shareholder rights, is often mandated.
3. **Regulatory Compliance:** Compliance with relevant national and international regulations.

For example, the NYSE requires companies to have at least 1.1 million publicly traded shares with a collective market value of $100 million and at least $10 million in pre-tax earnings over the last three years. These strictures help ensure that listed companies are well-established and financially stable.

## Benefits of Having a Listed Security

1. **Visibility and Prestige:** Being listed on a major stock exchange like NASDAQ or NYSE enhances a company's visibility and establishes its market credibility.
2. **Liquidity:** Listed securities are generally more liquid, as they can easily be bought and sold on the open market.
3. **Access to Capital:** Companies gain greater access to capital through the ability to issue more shares or debt.
4. **Valuation:** The continual trading of listed securities provides a transparent and real-time valuation of the company.

## Regulatory Oversight

Regulatory bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States or the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK enforce regulations that oversee the trading of listed securities. They ensure the integrity of the markets and the protection of investors by mandating periodic disclosures of financial performance and maintaining fair trading practices.

## Types of Listed Securities

### Equities

- **Common Stock:** Represents ownership in a company and entitles shareholders to vote at shareholder meetings and receive dividends.
- **Preferred Stock:** Carries no voting rights but entitles the holder to dividends before common stockholders receive theirs.

### Debt Securities

- **Corporate Bonds:** These are debt securities issued by corporations to fund their operations and projects.
- **Convertible Bonds:** Bonds that can be converted into a predetermined number of the issuing company's shares.

### Derivative Securities

- **Options:** Contracts giving the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a security at a set price before a specific date.
- **Futures:** Standardized contracts obligating the buyer to purchase, and the seller to sell, a particular asset at a predetermined future date and price.

## Listing Process

1. **Pre-Submission:** The company ensures compliance with the exchange's listing requirements.
2. **Application:** Submission of a listing application, including all financial statements and disclosures.
3. **Review:** The exchange reviews the application and may request additional documentation.
4. **Approval:** Upon approval, the security is officially listed and given a ticker symbol.
5. **Ongoing Compliance:** The listed company must continue to meet the exchangeâ€™s standards, including periodic reporting and disclosures.

## Risks and Considerations

- **Market Volatility:** Listed securities can be subject to market volatility, affected by overall economic conditions, market sentiments, and geopolitical factors.
- **Regulatory Changes:** Changes in regulations can impact the attractiveness and operational capabilities of listed companies.
- **Cost:** Maintaining a listing involves costs such as listing fees, compliance costs, and potential legal fees.

## Conclusion

Listed securities play a critical role in the financial markets, providing companies with capital and investors with opportunities for ownership and income. The stringent listing requirements aim to ensure transparency, stability, and investor protection. However, the benefits come with responsibilities and risks, requiring companies and investors to be vigilant and well-informed.

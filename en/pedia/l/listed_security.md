# Listed Security

A [listed](../l/listed.md) [security](../s/security.md) is a [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) that is traded on a formally recognized stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md), such as the New York Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (NYSE), [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md), the London Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (LSE), or any other [exchange](../e/exchange.md) that maintains strict [listing requirements](../l/listing_requirements.md). The process of listing a [security](../s/security.md) involves meeting specific standards set by the [exchange](../e/exchange.md), which ensures that only companies of sufficient worth and [transparency](../t/transparency.md) [gain](../g/gain.md) access to these trading platforms.

## What is a Listed Security?

[Listed](../l/listed.md) securities encompass a variety of financial instruments including [stocks](../s/stock.md) (common and preferred), bonds, and other types of assets. The listing process means that the issuing entity, often a [corporation](../c/corporation.md), adheres to the regulations and requirements prescribed by the stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md). As a result, being [listed](../l/listed.md) enhances the credibility and [visibility](../v/visibility.md) of the [security](../s/security.md).

## Requirements for Listing

The specific requirements for listing can vary between exchanges but generally include:

1. **Financial Standards:** The company must have a certain amount of [net tangible assets](../n/net_tangible_assets.md), [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md), and [earnings](../e/earnings.md).
2. **[Corporate Governance](../c/corporate_governance.md):** Compliance with governance practices, including board structure and [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) rights, is often mandated.
3. **Regulatory Compliance:** Compliance with relevant national and international regulations.

For example, the NYSE requires companies to have at least 1.1 million publicly traded [shares](../s/shares.md) with a collective [market value](../m/market_value.md) of $100 million and at least $10 million in pre-tax [earnings](../e/earnings.md) over the last three years. These strictures help ensure that [listed](../l/listed.md) companies are well-established and financially stable.

## Benefits of Having a Listed Security

1. **[Visibility](../v/visibility.md) and Prestige:** Being [listed](../l/listed.md) on a major stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md) like [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md) or NYSE enhances a company's [visibility](../v/visibility.md) and establishes its [market](../m/market.md) credibility.
2. **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md):** [Listed](../l/listed.md) securities are generally more [liquid](../l/liquid.md), as they can easily be bought and sold on the [open market](../o/open_market.md).
3. **Access to [Capital](../c/capital.md):** Companies [gain](../g/gain.md) greater access to [capital](../c/capital.md) through the ability to [issue](../i/issue.md) more [shares](../s/shares.md) or [debt](../d/debt.md).
4. **[Valuation](../v/valuation.md):** The continual trading of [listed](../l/listed.md) securities provides a transparent and real-time [valuation](../v/valuation.md) of the company.

## Regulatory Oversight

Regulatory bodies such as the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) in the United States or the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK enforce regulations that oversee the trading of [listed](../l/listed.md) securities. They ensure the integrity of the markets and the protection of investors by mandating periodic disclosures of [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) and maintaining fair trading practices.

## Types of Listed Securities

### Equities

- **[Common Stock](../c/common_stock.md):** Represents ownership in a company and entitles shareholders to vote at [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) meetings and receive dividends.
- **[Preferred Stock](../p/preferred_stock.md):** Carries no voting rights but entitles the holder to dividends before common stockholders receive theirs.

### Debt Securities

- **Corporate Bonds:** These are [debt](../d/debt.md) securities issued by corporations to [fund](../f/fund.md) their operations and projects.
- **Convertible Bonds:** Bonds that can be converted into a predetermined number of the issuing company's [shares](../s/shares.md).

### Derivative Securities

- **[Options](../o/options.md):** Contracts giving the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a [security](../s/security.md) at a set price before a specific date.
- **[Futures](../f/futures.md):** Standardized contracts obligating the buyer to purchase, and the seller to sell, a particular [asset](../a/asset.md) at a predetermined future date and price.

## Listing Process

1. **Pre-Submission:** The company ensures compliance with the [exchange](../e/exchange.md)'s [listing requirements](../l/listing_requirements.md).
2. **Application:** Submission of a listing application, including all [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) and disclosures.
3. **Review:** The [exchange](../e/exchange.md) reviews the application and may request additional documentation.
4. **Approval:** Upon approval, the [security](../s/security.md) is officially [listed](../l/listed.md) and given a [ticker symbol](../t/ticker_symbol.md).
5. **Ongoing Compliance:** The [listed](../l/listed.md) company must continue to meet the [exchange](../e/exchange.md)â€™s standards, including periodic reporting and disclosures.

## Risks and Considerations

- **[Market](../m/market.md) [Volatility](../v/volatility.md):** [Listed](../l/listed.md) securities can be subject to [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md), affected by overall [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md), [market](../m/market.md) sentiments, and geopolitical factors.
- **Regulatory Changes:** Changes in regulations can impact the attractiveness and operational capabilities of [listed](../l/listed.md) companies.
- **Cost:** Maintaining a listing involves costs such as listing fees, compliance costs, and potential legal fees.

## Conclusion

[Listed](../l/listed.md) securities play a critical role in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), providing companies with [capital](../c/capital.md) and investors with opportunities for ownership and [income](../i/income.md). The stringent [listing requirements](../l/listing_requirements.md) aim to ensure [transparency](../t/transparency.md), stability, and [investor](../i/investor.md) protection. However, the benefits come with responsibilities and risks, requiring companies and investors to be vigilant and well-informed.

# London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR)

The London InterBank Offered Rate, commonly known as LIBOR, is a benchmark interest rate at which major global banks lend to one another in the international interbank market for short-term loans. LIBOR is determined and published by the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and serves as a globally accepted key benchmark interest rate that indicates borrowing costs between banks. It influences a wide array of financial products, including mortgages, loans, bonds, and derivatives.

## Structure of LIBOR

LIBOR rates are calculated for five currencies and seven borrowing periods, ranging from overnight to one year. The five currencies are:

- US Dollar (USD)
- Euro (EUR)
- British Pound (GBP)
- Japanese Yen (JPY)
- Swiss Franc (CHF)

The seven maturities, or borrowing periods, are:

1. Overnight
2. One week
3. One month
4. Two months
5. Three months
6. Six months
7. Twelve months

Each combination of currency and maturity results in a distinct rate; for instance, USD three-month LIBOR or GBP six-month LIBOR. In total, there are 35 different LIBOR rates published every business day.

## Calculation Methodology

LIBOR rates are calculated based on submissions from a panel of contributor banks. Each bank provides an estimate of the rate at which it can borrow unsecured funds in the interbank market for each maturity and currency combination. The rates submitted are meant to reflect credible transaction data when available, but they can also be judgement-based.

Once the submissions are gathered, the highest and lowest quartiles are excluded from the calculation to remove outliers. The remaining rates are then averaged to determine the day's LIBOR for each maturity and currency.

## Historical Context

LIBOR was first established in 1986 by the British Bankers' Association (BBA) to provide a standardized benchmark for the financial markets. Over the years, it has become one of the most important interest rates in the world, referenced in an estimated $350 trillion worth of financial contracts globally, including mortgages, student loans, and complex derivatives.

## The LIBOR Scandal

In 2012, a major scandal erupted when it was revealed that multiple banks had deliberately manipulated LIBOR submissions for profit or to appear more creditworthy. The manipulation was particularly damaging because of LIBOR's widespread use in global finance. Following investigations, several banks were fined billions of dollars, and regulatory reforms were instituted to overhaul the LIBOR setting process.

## Transition Away from LIBOR

Due to its vulnerabilities and the scandal, financial regulators have sought to transition away from LIBOR to more reliable, transaction-based benchmarks. For example, in the United States, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) selected the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as the preferred replacement for USD LIBOR. Similarly, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK has endorsed SONIA (Sterling Overnight Index Average) as an alternative to GBP LIBOR.

The transition away from LIBOR involves several steps, including:

1. Adoption of alternative reference rates like SOFR, SONIA, â‚¬STR (Euro Short-Term Rate), SARON (Swiss Average Rate Overnight), and TONA (Tokyo Overnight Average Rate).
2. Amendment of existing contracts to include fallback language, specifying how rates should be determined once LIBOR is phased out.
3. Education and outreach to market participants to facilitate a smooth transition.

## Key Players

Several organizations and regulatory bodies are playing critical roles in the LIBOR transition process:

- **Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)**: Responsible for the administration and publication of LIBOR.

- **Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)**: The UK regulator overseeing the phase-out of LIBOR and its replacement with alternative rates.

- **Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC)**: A group convened by the Federal Reserve to guide the transition from USD LIBOR to SOFR in the U.S.

- **International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA)**: Provides standard documentation and protocols to facilitate the LIBOR transition in the derivatives market.

## Implications for Financial Markets

The transition from LIBOR to alternative benchmark rates has significant implications for different segments of the financial market. Here is a detailed look at its impact:

### Loan Markets

LIBOR has been widely used as the base rate for both corporate and consumer loans, including syndicated loans, mortgages, and student loans. Moving to alternative rates entails renegotiating loan agreements to incorporate new benchmark rates, which can be complex and costly. Financial institutions may also incur substantial operational expenses to update systems and train staff.

### Derivatives Markets

The derivatives market, valued at hundreds of trillions of dollars, has a significant exposure to LIBOR-based contracts, including interest rate swaps, futures, and options. Transitioning to new reference rates like SOFR or SONIA requires market participants to adhere to new standards established by organizations like ISDA. The complexity arises in updating legacy contracts and ensuring consistency across global markets.

### Bond Markets

Bonds and other fixed-income securities often reference LIBOR for interest rate calculations. Issuers will need to amend existing documentation to reflect alternative rates, which may involve regulatory filings, investor consent, and legal challenges. The liquidity of new benchmark rate-based bonds may initially be lower as markets adjust to the transition.

### Consumer Finance

For consumers, the transition from LIBOR affects variable-rate products like adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) and student loans that are tied to LIBOR. Financial institutions must communicate changes effectively to consumers and offer transparency about how new rates will be determined. Consumer advocacy groups emphasize the need for clear disclosures to prevent financial distress due to rate fluctuations.

### Risk Management and Hedging

The move from LIBOR to new benchmark rates introduces basis risk, as the new rates may behave differently from LIBOR. Therefore, financial institutions need to reassess their hedging strategies, risk models, and valuation methods to account for differences between old and new rates. Comprehensive risk management practices must be developed to mitigate potential discrepancies.

## Conclusion

The London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) has been a cornerstone of global financial markets for decades, serving as a key benchmark interest rate for various financial products. However, due to past manipulation scandals and inherent vulnerabilities, a transition to more transparent, transaction-based reference rates is underway. Organizations, regulators, and market participants worldwide are actively working towards a more resilient and trustworthy financial benchmark system, ensuring stability and confidence in the financial markets.

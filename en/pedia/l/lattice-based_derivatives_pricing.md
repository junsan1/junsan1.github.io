# Lattice-Based Derivatives Pricing

Lattice-based [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) pricing is a numerical method used to evaluate the price of financial [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md). It relies on constructing a lattice, or a grid of possible future asset prices, and then traces the derivative's value backward through time from maturity to the present. Lattice models are particularly useful for pricing American options, which can be exercised at any time before expiration.

### Understanding Derivatives

Before delving into lattice-based pricing, it’s crucial to understand what [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) are. [Derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) are financial instruments whose value depends on the value of an underlying asset. These can be stocks, bonds, commodities, interest rates, or market indexes. The most common types of [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) include options, futures, forwards, and swaps.

### The Basis of Lattice Models

Lattice models, particularly binomial and trinomial trees, are discrete-time methods. They break down the time to maturity into several intervals, creating a tree of possible price paths the underlying asset might follow. The two primary lattice models are:

1. **Binomial Tree Model**: Proposed by Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein in 1979, this model assumes that, at each time step, the price of the underlying asset can either go up or down by specific factors.
2. **Trinomial Tree Model**: An extension of the binomial model, this method adds a third possible price move: the price remaining the same.

### Binomial Tree Model

#### Construction of the Binomial Tree

- **Step 1**: Define the parameters including the underlying asset's initial price (S), strike price (K), risk-free rate (r), volatility (σ), time to maturity (T), and the number of steps (N) in the binomial tree.
- **Step 2**: Calculate the up (u) and down (d) factors using the formulas:
  \[
  u = e^{\sigma \sqrt{\Delta t}}
  \]
  \[
  d = \frac{1}{u} = e^{-\sigma \sqrt{\Delta t}}
  \]
  where \(\Delta t = \frac{T}{N}\) is the length of one step.
- **Step 3**: Calculate the risk-neutral probabilities of an upward (\(p\)) and downward (\(1-p\)) movement using the formula:
  \[
  p = \frac{e^{r \Delta t} - d}{u - d}
  \]

#### Valuation Process

- **Step 4**: 
Construct the stock price tree starting from the initial price S. For each subsequent step, compute the stock prices using the up and down factors.
- **Step 5**: Calculate the payoff at each final node (at maturity) based on the type of option (e.g., for a European call option, the payoff is \(\max(S-K, 0)\)).
- **Step 6**: Use the risk-neutral probabilities to work backward through the tree. At each node, compute the expected option value, discounted at the risk-free rate. For American options, also compare this value to the immediate exercise value, choosing the maximum.

### Trinomial Tree Model

The trinomial tree model subdivides the price movements further to provide more accuracy and stability.

#### Construction of the Trinomial Tree

- **Step 1**: Define the same initial parameters as in the binomial model.
- **Step 2**: Calculate the up (\(u\)), down (\(d\)), and middle (m) factors:
  \[
  u = e^{\sigma \sqrt{2 \Delta t}}
  \]
  \[
  d = e^{-\sigma \sqrt{2 \Delta t}}
  \]
  \[
  m = 1
  \]

#### Valuation Process

- **Step 3**: Construct the stock price tree starting from the initial price and moving according to the up, down, and middle factors.
- **Step 4**: Calculate the probabilities of moving to each node. For a trinomial tree, probabilities \(p_u\), \(p_d\), and \(p_m\) (for up, down, and middle movements, respectively) often require a system of equations ensuring the tree is recombining correctly and that probabilities sum to one.

### Advantages and Limitations

#### Advantages:

1. **Flexibility**: Lattice models can handle a variety of [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), including [exotic options](../e/exotic_options.md) and those with path dependency.
2. **Intuitive Approach**: The step-by-step construction of price movements provides insights into the dynamics of option pricing.
3. **Application to American Options**: Unlike the [Black-Scholes model](../b/black-scholes_model.md), lattice models can efficiently price American options, which involve early exercise.

#### Limitations:

1. **Computationally Intensive**: As the number of steps increases, the complexity and computational resources required grow exponentially, especially in high-dimensional problems.
2. **Approximation**: Lattice models discretize continuous processes, which introduces approximation errors.
3. **Assumptions**: Rely on assumptions such as constant volatility and risk-free rate, which may not hold in real markets.

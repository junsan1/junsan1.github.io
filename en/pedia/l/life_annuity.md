# Life Annuity

A life annuity is a financial product primarily used for [retirement planning](../r/retirement_planning.md). It is a contract between an individual and an [insurance](../i/insurance.md) company where the individual agrees to make a [lump-sum payment](../l/lump-sum_payment.md) or a series of payments to the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) company. In [return](../r/return.md), the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) company agrees to provide the individual with regular payments for the rest of their life. These payments can be fixed or variable and often begin at a specified retirement age.

## Key Components of Life Annuities

### Premium Payment
The [premium](../p/premium.md) [payment](../p/payment.md) is the amount of [money](../m/money.md) the individual pays to the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) company to purchase the annuity. Premiums can be made as a single lump sum or as a series of periodic payments. The amount of the [premium](../p/premium.md) [will](../w/will.md) influence the size of the annuity payments.

### Income Payments
[Income](../i/income.md) payments are the regular disbursements made to the [annuitant](../a/annuitant.md) (the individual who purchased the annuity). These payments can be structured to continue for the lifetime of the [annuitant](../a/annuitant.md) or for a specified period, depending on the annuity's terms.

### Immediate vs. Deferred Annuities
Life annuities can be immediate or deferred:
- **Immediate Annuities**: Payments begin almost immediately after the investment is made.
- **Deferred Annuities**: Payments begin at a future date, often after the individual has retired. Deferred annuities have an [accumulation phase](../a/accumulation_phase.md) and a [distribution](../d/distribution.md) phase.

### Fixed vs. Variable Annuities
- **Fixed Annuities**: Provide guaranteed payouts. The [insurance](../i/insurance.md) company assumes the investment [risk](../r/risk.md).
- **Variable Annuities**: Payouts can vary based on the performance of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) investments selected by the [annuitant](../a/annuitant.md). The [annuitant](../a/annuitant.md) bears the investment [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Mortality Credits
Mortality credits are the extra [interest](../i/interest.md) earned by those who live longer than expected, sourced from the premiums paid by those who pass away earlier than anticipated. This concept is fundamental to the pooling of [risk](../r/risk.md) in life annuities.

## Types of Life Annuities

### Single Life Annuity
This type of annuity makes payments for the [duration](../d/duration.md) of one individual's life. Payments cease upon their death.

### Joint and Survivor Annuity
Payments are made until both annuitants (usually spouses) have passed away. Payments can be the same throughout both lives or adjustable upon the death of the first [annuitant](../a/annuitant.md).

### Life with Period Certain Annuity
Guarantees payments for life but also ensures that if the [annuitant](../a/annuitant.md) dies within a specified period, payments continue to a [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md) for the remainder of the period.

### Inflated-Indexed Annuity
Payments increase based on a specified [inflation](../i/inflation.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md) to protect the [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) of the [annuitant](../a/annuitant.md)’s [income](../i/income.md).

## Benefits of Life Annuities

### Longevity Risk Mitigation
Life annuities provide a [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against outliving one’s savings, ensuring a steady [income](../i/income.md) stream for life.

### Tax Deferral
Deferred annuities allow investment gains to grow [tax-deferred](../t/tax_deferred.md) until withdrawals are made, potentially minimizing tax liabilities during peak earning years.

### Customization Options
Annuities [offer](../o/offer.md) flexibility in terms of [payment](../p/payment.md) [options](../o/options.md), start dates, and additional riders (like long-term care riders) that can be added for more comprehensive coverage.

## Considerations and Risks

### Illiquidity
Once [premium](../p/premium.md) payments are made, accessing the sum can be difficult or involve significant penalties, making annuities relatively illiquid.

### Fees and Expenses
Annuities can come with high fees, including administrative fees, [investment management](../i/investment_management.md) fees, and charges for additional riders.

### Interest Rate Risk
In fixed annuities, the [rate of return](../r/rate_of_return.md) can be impacted by prevailing [interest](../i/interest.md) rates at the time of purchase, which can affect long-term [income](../i/income.md) potential.

### Inflation Risk
Unless specifically indexed for [inflation](../i/inflation.md), [fixed annuity](../f/fixed_annuity.md) payments might lose [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) over time due to [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

## Regulatory Environment and Financial Strength

### Regulatory Oversight
Annuities are regulated by state [insurance](../i/insurance.md) regulators in the U.S., with oversight ensuring financial stability and ethical [business](../b/business.md) practices within [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies. Organizations such as the National Association of [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) Commissioners (NAIC) play a key role in guiding these regulations.

### Financial Strength of Insurers
The financial viability of an [insurance](../i/insurance.md) company is crucial, as it needs to honor [income](../i/income.md) payments for potentially decades. Ratings from agencies like Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s, and A.M. Best provide insights into insurers' [financial health](../f/financial_health.md).

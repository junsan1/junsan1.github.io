# Leveraged ETFs

#### Overview

Leveraged [Exchange](../e/exchange.md)-Traded Funds (ETFs) are a type of [investment fund](../i/investment_fund.md) that seek to deliver multiples of the performance of the [index](../i/index.md) or [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) they track. For instance, a 2x [leveraged ETF](../l/leveraged_etf.md) aims to deliver twice the daily performance of its [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [index](../i/index.md). In contrast, a -2x [leveraged ETF](../l/leveraged_etf.md) aims to deliver twice the inverse of the daily performance of its [index](../i/index.md). These financial instruments are ideal for [short-term trading](../s/short-term_trading.md) strategies and are popular among those who implement [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) (algotrading) methodologies to exploit short-term trends and [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

#### Structure

Leveraged ETFs use a combination of [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), including swaps, [options](../o/options.md), and [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md), to achieve their targeting [leverage](../l/leverage.md). The [underlying](../u/underlying.md) portfolio of these ETFs is usually composed of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) securities plus [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) to achieve the leveraged exposure. The [fund](../f/fund.md)'s daily [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) mechanism ensures it maintains the specified [leverage ratio](../l/leverage_ratio.md) for the next trading day.

#### Daily Rebalancing and Compounding Effect

One of the critical characteristics of leveraged ETFs is their daily [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md). This means that these ETFs are designed to achieve their target [multiple](../m/multiple.md) returns on a daily [basis](../b/basis.md), not over longer periods. The daily [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md), coupled with [compounding](../c/compounding.md) effects, means that the long-term performance of leveraged ETFs can deviate significantly from their intended [leverage](../l/leverage.md) [multiple](../m/multiple.md) of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [index](../i/index.md). This effect is particularly pronounced in volatile markets.

#### Example of Compounding Effect

Consider a 2x [leveraged ETF](../l/leveraged_etf.md) that tracks an [index](../i/index.md). On Day 1, if the [index](../i/index.md) rises by 1%, the ETF would be expected to rise by 2%. However, if on Day 2, the [index](../i/index.md) falls by 1%, the ETF would fall by 2%. Over [multiple](../m/multiple.md) days, where the [index](../i/index.md) has ups and downs, the [leveraged ETF](../l/leveraged_etf.md)'s performance can diverge significantly due to the effects of daily [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) and [compounding](../c/compounding.md).

#### Types of Leveraged ETFs

Leveraged ETFs come in various flavors, including:

- **2x or 3x [Bull](../b/bull.md) ETFs**: Seek to achieve twice or three times the daily performance of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [index](../i/index.md).
- **-2x or -3x Bear ETFs**: Seek to achieve twice or three times the inverse of the daily performance of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [index](../i/index.md).
  
#### Uses in Algorithmic Trading

Algorithmic traders frequently use leveraged ETFs for [short-term trading](../s/short-term_trading.md) strategies due to their ability to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) quickly on [market](../m/market.md) movements. [High-frequency trading algorithms](../h/high-frequency_trading_algorithms.md) can exploit the [leverage](../l/leverage.md) and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) of these funds to achieve superior returns on smaller movements in the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [index](../i/index.md).

Some common [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) strategies involving leveraged ETFs include:

- **[Mean Reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md)**: [Trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) that take advantage of short-term price deviations from the mean.
- **[Momentum Trading](../m/momentum_trading.md)**: Strategies designed to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on the [momentum](../m/momentum.md) of rising or falling prices.
- **[Market](../m/market.md) Making**: Algorithms that provide [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) by simultaneously buying and selling leveraged ETFs to earn a small spread.

#### Risks and Considerations

While leveraged ETFs can be alluring due to the potential for amplified returns, they come with significant risks, particularly:

- **[Volatility Risk](../v/volatility_risk.md)**: Leveraged ETFs can be extremely volatile due to their nature of amplifying daily movements.
- **Decay in [Value](../v/value.md)**: Over longer periods, the daily [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) can lead to a significant decay in [value](../v/value.md).
- **[Risk](../r/risk.md) of Large Losses**: Leveraged ETFs can lead to large losses if the [market](../m/market.md) moves against the position of the ETF dramatically.

#### Regulatory Landscape

The Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) in the United States monitors and regulates leveraged ETFs to ensure adequate [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and full [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) to investors. Many leveraged ETFs are also subject to strict [margin](../m/margin.md) requirements and operational guidelines to prevent excessive [risk](../r/risk.md)-taking.

#### Popular Leveraged ETFs

Some of the well-known leveraged ETFs include:

- **ProShares UltraPro QQQ (TQQQ)**: A 3x [leveraged ETF](../l/leveraged_etf.md) that aims to deliver three times the daily performance of the [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md)-100 [Index](../i/index.md).
- **Direxion Daily Financial [Bull](../b/bull.md) 3X [Shares](../s/shares.md) (FAS)**: A 3x [leveraged ETF](../l/leveraged_etf.md) that aims to achieve three times the daily performance of the Russell 1000 Financial Services [Index](../i/index.md).
- **ProShares UltraShort S&P500 (SDS)**: A -2x [leveraged ETF](../l/leveraged_etf.md) that seeks to deliver twice the inverse daily performance of the S&P 500 [Index](../i/index.md).

#### Key Players in Leveraged ETF Space

The [leveraged ETF](../l/leveraged_etf.md) [market](../m/market.md) is dominated by a few key players, including:

- **ProShares**: [ProShares](https://www.proshares.com), a leading provider of leveraged ETFs, [offering](../o/offering.md) a wide [range](../r/range.md) of products across various [asset](../a/asset.md) classes.
- **Direxion**: [Direxion](https://www.direxion.com), another major provider known for its diverse [leveraged ETF](../l/leveraged_etf.md) offerings.
- **VelocityShares**: [VelocityShares](https://www.velocityshares.com), specializing in leveraged and inverse [volatility](../v/volatility.md) ETFs.

#### Conclusion

Leveraged ETFs [offer](../o/offer.md) an exciting terrain for sophisticated investors and algorithmic traders due to their ability to magnify daily returns and provide exposure to dynamic [market](../m/market.md) movements. However, they require a deep understanding of their structure, [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) mechanism, and inherent risks. When used appropriately, they can be a powerful tool in achieving [short-term trading](../s/short-term_trading.md) objectives, but their long-term use necessitates caution due to the potential for [value](../v/value.md) erosion and increased [volatility](../v/volatility.md). Investors and traders should conduct thorough [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md) and be prepared for the complexities associated with these financial instruments.

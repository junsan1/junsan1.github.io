# Long Calendar Spread

A Long Calendar Spread is an [options](../o/options.md) [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) that aims to [profit](../p/profit.md) from the passage of time and the differences in the implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md) of [options](../o/options.md) with the same [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) but different expiration dates. This strategy is often utilized in a [market](../m/market.md) with low [volatility](../v/volatility.md), and it generally benefits from the phenomenon known as [time decay](../t/time_decay.md).

## Components of a Long Calendar Spread

1. **[Options](../o/options.md) Purchasing:**
    - **Long Option (Far-term):** Buy a longer-term option contract.
    - **Short Option (Near-term):** Sell a shorter-term option contract with the same [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).
2. **[Strike Price](../s/strike_price.md):**
    - Both [options](../o/options.md) share the same [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).
3. **Expiration Dates:**
    - The two [options](../o/options.md) have different expiration dates, with the short-term option expiring before the long-term option.

## Objectives of a Long Calendar Spread

- **[Time Decay](../t/time_decay.md) Differentials:** The primary objective is to [profit](../p/profit.md) from the faster [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) ([theta](../t/theta.md)) of the short-term option compared to the slower [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) of the long-term option.
- **[Volatility](../v/volatility.md) Changes:** The strategy can benefit from changes in implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md) if the longer-term option experiences an increase in implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md) close to the short-term option's expiration.

## Execution Steps

1. **Select the [Underlying Asset](../u/underlying_asset.md):** Choose a stock or [index](../i/index.md) that you believe [will](../w/will.md) have low [volatility](../v/volatility.md).
2. **Select [Strike Price](../s/strike_price.md) and Expiry:** Determine the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) and select two [options](../o/options.md) with different expiration dates.
3. **Buy and Sell [Options](../o/options.md):** Place trades to buy the longer-term option and sell the shorter-term option.

## Example of Long Calendar Spread

- **[Underlying Asset](../u/underlying_asset.md):** Consider a stock currently trading at $100.
- **[Strike Price](../s/strike_price.md):** Both [options](../o/options.md) selected have a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $100.
- **Expiration Dates:**
  - **Buy:** Long-term [call option](../c/call_option.md) with a six-month expiration.
  - **Sell:** Short-term [call option](../c/call_option.md) with a one-month expiration.

In this scenario, you benefit if the stock price remains around the $100 mark, knowing that the short-term option [will](../w/will.md) decay faster than the long-term option.

## Risk and Reward Profile

- **Maximum [Profit](../p/profit.md):** The maximum [profit](../p/profit.md) typically occurs near the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) as the short-term option expires.
- **Maximum Loss:** The maximum loss is the net [debit](../d/debit.md) (initial cost of the [trade](../t/trade.md)).
- **Breakeven Points:** There are typically two breakeven points, which can be calculated by adding and subtracting the [net premium](../n/net_premium.md) paid from the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).

## Market Conditions Suitability

- **Low [Volatility](../v/volatility.md):** This strategy is most effective in low-[volatility](../v/volatility.md) environments, where the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) doesn't have large price swings.
- **Stable [Asset](../a/asset.md) Price:** Suitability increases if the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) price remains stable over the [holding period](../h/holding_period.md).

## Adjustments and Expiration

- **Close the Spread:** Before the short-term option expires, close both positions by buying back the short-term option and selling the long-term option.
- **[Roll Forward](../r/roll_forward.md):** Extend the [trade](../t/trade.md) by selling another short-term option with a new [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md), creating a new calendar spread.
- **Let it Expire:** If the short-term option is out-of-the-[money](../m/money.md), let it expire worthless and you are left with a long position in the original long-term option.

## Advantages

- **[Time Decay](../t/time_decay.md) ([Theta](../t/theta.md)) Benefit:** Profits from the difference in [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) between the two [options](../o/options.md).
- **[Volatility](../v/volatility.md) Play:** Can be advantageous if the longer-term option experiences increased implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md).
- **Controlled [Risk](../r/risk.md):** Maximum loss is limited to the initial [premium](../p/premium.md) paid.

## Disadvantages

- **Limited [Profit](../p/profit.md) Potential:** The maximum [profit](../p/profit.md) is limited and typically only achieved if the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) price remains near the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).
- **Directional Bias:** If the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) moves significantly away from the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md), the strategy can incur losses.
- **Time Sensitivity:** Requires monitoring and potential adjustments, especially close to short-term option expiration.

## Real-World Applications

Many professional traders and institutions use Long Calendar [Spreads](../s/spreads.md) as a part of a diversified [options](../o/options.md) [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md). Firms such as [TastyWorks](https://tastyworks.com), [E*TRADE](https://www.etrade.com) provide platforms and tools to execute these strategies efficiently.

## Conclusion

Long Calendar [Spreads](../s/spreads.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) an intriguing approach to [options](../o/options.md) trading, leveraging the differences in [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) and implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md) between [options](../o/options.md) of different expirations. By carefully selecting the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), strike prices, and expiration dates, traders can construct [spreads](../s/spreads.md) that maximize [profit](../p/profit.md) potential while controlling [risk](../r/risk.md). This strategy is particularly suited to markets characterized by low [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and stable [asset](../a/asset.md) prices.

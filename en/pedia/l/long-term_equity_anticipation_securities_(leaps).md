# Long-Term Equity Anticipation Securities (LEAPS)

Long-Term [Equity](../e/equity.md) Anticipation Securities, commonly known as LEAPS, are long-term [options](../o/options.md) contracts that allow investors to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on the future movements of a stock or an [index](../i/index_instrument.md). These financial instruments are similar to standard [options](../o/options.md) but have expiration dates that are significantly further into the future, typically ranging from nine months to three years. LEAPS are available in the form of both calls and puts, allowing investors to [leverage](../l/leverage.md) their positions in anticipation of upward or downward [market](../m/market.md) movements.

## What are LEAPS?

LEAPS provide investors with the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a [security](../s/security.md) at a predetermined price, known as the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md), on or before a specified [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md). Due to their extended [duration](../d/duration.md), LEAPS [offer](../o/offer.md) several advantages over traditional short-term [options](../o/options.md), including the ability to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) [long-term investments](../l/long-term_investments.md), manage portfolio [risk](../r/risk.md), and amplify potential returns.

### Components of LEAPS

1. **[Strike Price](../s/strike_price.md):** The price at which the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) can be bought or sold.
2. **[Expiration Date](../e/expiration_date.md):** The date on which the option contract expires, which can be as long as three years from the date of issuance.
3. **[Premium](../p/premium.md):** The price paid for purchasing the LEAPS contract. This tends to be higher than that of short-term [options](../o/options.md) due to the extended [time horizon](../t/time_horizon.md).
4. **[Underlying Asset](../u/underlying_asset.md):** The stock or [index](../i/index_instrument.md) that the LEAPS contract is based on.

### Types of LEAPS

1. **LEAPS Calls:** These give the holder the right to buy the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) before the option expires.
2. **LEAPS Puts:** These give the holder the right to sell the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) before the option expires.

## Advantages of LEAPS

### Long Time Horizon
One of the primary advantages of LEAPS is their long expiration period. Traditional [options](../o/options.md) typically have expiration periods that [range](../r/range.md) from a few weeks to a few months, while LEAPS can have expirations of up to three years. This extended period allows investors to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on longer-term [market](../m/market.md) trends without the need for constant monitoring and trading.

### Hedging and Insurance
LEAPS are often used as a hedging tool to protect [long-term investments](../l/long-term_investments.md). For example, an [investor](../i/investor.md) holding a significant position in a stock can purchase LEAPS puts to safeguard against potential losses. This acts as a form of [portfolio insurance](../p/portfolio_insurance.md), providing protection from downturns over an extended period.

### Leverage
Like standard [options](../o/options.md), LEAPS provide [leverage](../l/leverage.md). Investors can control a larger amount of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) with a relatively small investment in the [options](../o/options.md) [premium](../p/premium.md). This can amplify returns if the [asset](../a/asset.md) moves in the anticipated direction. However, it's important to [note](../n/note.md) that [leverage](../l/leverage.md) also increases [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Lower Theta Decay
[Theta](../t/theta.md) decay refers to the decline in the [value](../v/value.md) of an option as it approaches its [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md). LEAPS, due to their extended [duration](../d/duration.md), exhibit lower [theta](../t/theta.md) decay compared to short-term [options](../o/options.md). This means the [time value](../t/time_value.md) erodes more slowly, which can be beneficial for long-term strategies.

## Disadvantages of LEAPS

### Higher Premiums
Due to their extended time frame, LEAPS generally have higher premiums compared to short-term [options](../o/options.md). This can make them more expensive to purchase, which might not be suitable for all investors.

### Lower Liquidity
LEAPS tend to have lower trading volumes compared to short-term [options](../o/options.md). This can result in wider [bid](../b/bid.md)-ask [spreads](../s/spreads.md), making it more costly to enter or exit positions. Lower [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) can also make it challenging to execute large trades without impacting the [market price](../m/market_price.md).

### Time Erosion
While LEAPS have a longer [time horizon](../t/time_horizon.md), they are still subject to [time decay](../t/time_decay.md), albeit at a slower rate. Investors need to be mindful of this aspect as it could erode the [value](../v/value.md) of their position over time.

## Strategies Involving LEAPS

### LEAPS Calls as Stock Replacement
Instead of purchasing [shares](../s/shares.md) of a stock outright, an [investor](../i/investor.md) might buy LEAPS calls to [gain](../g/gain.md) exposure to the stock's upward movement. This requires less [capital](../c/capital.md) and offers leveraged profits if the stock performs well. However, this strategy also comes with the [risk](../r/risk.md) of losing the [premium](../p/premium.md) paid if the stock does not move as anticipated.

### Protective Puts
Investors holding a long position in a stock can purchase LEAPS puts as a long-term [hedge](../h/hedge.md). This strategy provides downside protection for the stock, as the puts increase in [value](../v/value.md) if the stock price declines. It's akin to buying [insurance](../i/insurance.md) against a potential drop in the stock's [value](../v/value.md).

### Covered Call Writing with LEAPS
An [investor](../i/investor.md) holding LEAPS calls can write (sell) short-term call [options](../o/options.md) against them. This strategy generates [income](../i/income.md) from the premiums received for writing the short-term calls. While this [income](../i/income.md) can [offset](../o/offset.md) the cost of the LEAPS, it also limits the potential [upside](../u/upside.md) if the stock's price increases significantly.

### Calendar Spreads
Involves buying and selling LEAPS with different expiration dates or strike prices. For example, an [investor](../i/investor.md) might purchase a LEAPS call with a longer-term expiration while simultaneously selling a call with a shorter-term expiration on the same stock. This strategy seeks to exploit differences in [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) and [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

## Risks Associated with LEAPS

### Market Risk
Like all [options](../o/options.md), LEAPS are subject to [market risk](../m/market_risk.md). If the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) does not move in the anticipated direction, the [investor](../i/investor.md) could lose the entire [premium](../p/premium.md) paid for the LEAPS contract.

### Volatility Risk
Changes in [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) can affect the price of LEAPS. For instance, an unexpected decrease in [volatility](../v/volatility.md) can reduce the [value](../v/value.md) of both LEAPS calls and puts. 

### Interest Rate Risk
[Interest](../i/interest.md) rates can influence the price of LEAPS, particularly those with longer durations. Rising [interest](../i/interest.md) rates tend to decrease the [value](../v/value.md) of call [options](../o/options.md) and increase the [value](../v/value.md) of [put options](../p/put_options.md).

### Early Assignment Risk
Though less common with LEAPS compared to traditional [options](../o/options.md), there is still a [risk](../r/risk.md) of early [assignment](../a/assignment.md) for American-style LEAPS contracts. This could force an [investor](../i/investor.md) to buy or sell the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) before the intended date.

## Conclusion

Long-Term [Equity](../e/equity.md) Anticipation Securities (LEAPS) [offer](../o/offer.md) a versatile tool for investors looking to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on long-term [market](../m/market.md) trends, manage [risk](../r/risk.md), and amplify returns. While they present numerous advantages, including an extended [time horizon](../t/time_horizon.md), lower [theta](../t/theta.md) decay, and [leverage](../l/leverage.md), they also come with risks such as higher premiums, lower [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), and [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md). 

Given their complexity and the potential risks involved, LEAPS are generally better suited for seasoned investors with a thorough understanding of [options](../o/options.md) trading. Proper research, [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), and strategy are crucial for successful [investing](../i/investing.md) in LEAPS.

Understanding and efficiently leveraging LEAPS can be a powerful component of an [investor](../i/investor.md)'s trading arsenal, providing the potential for substantial returns and effective [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) over extended periods.

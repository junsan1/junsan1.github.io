# Low Volatility Anomaly

The Low [Volatility](../v/volatility.md) [Anomaly](../a/anomaly.md) is a fascinating and counterintuitive phenomenon observed in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), where securities with lower [risk](../r/risk.md) (or [volatility](../v/volatility.md)) tend to [outperform](../o/outperform.md) those with higher [risk](../r/risk.md) over the long term. This observation contradicts the traditional [finance](../f/finance.md) theory, particularly the [Capital Asset](../c/capital_asset.md) Pricing Model (CAPM), which posits a direct relationship between [risk](../r/risk.md) and [expected return](../e/expected_return.md)—higher [risk](../r/risk.md) should theoretically be compensated by higher returns. The Low [Volatility](../v/volatility.md) [Anomaly](../a/anomaly.md) has generated considerable [interest](../i/interest.md) among researchers, academics, and practitioners, leading to the development of various investment strategies aiming to exploit this [anomaly](../a/anomaly.md).

## Understanding Volatility and Risk

### Definitions

- **[Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: [Volatility](../v/volatility.md) refers to the degree of variation of an [asset](../a/asset.md)'s returns over time, which is commonly measured by the [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) or variance of returns. High [volatility](../v/volatility.md) indicates large price swings, whereas low [volatility](../v/volatility.md) signifies more stable prices.
- **[Risk](../r/risk.md)**: In the context of investment, [risk](../r/risk.md) often refers to the [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) regarding the returns an investment might produce. [Risk](../r/risk.md) is typically quantified by measures like [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md), variance, [Value](../v/value.md) at [Risk](../r/risk.md) (VaR), and [beta](../b/beta.md) (a measure of a stock's [volatility](../v/volatility.md) relative to the [market](../m/market.md)).

### Traditional Finance Theory

In traditional [finance](../f/finance.md) theory rooted in the CAPM, [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md) are linearly related. The model suggests that investors should expect higher returns as compensation for taking on higher [risk](../r/risk.md). According to the CAPM:

\[ \text{[Expected Return](../e/expected_return.md)} = R_f + \[beta](../b/beta.md) ( R_m - R_f ) \]

Where:
- \( R_f \) is the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate,
- \( R_m \) is the expected [market](../m/market.md) [return](../r/return.md),
- \( \[beta](../b/beta.md) \) is the measure of a stock’s [volatility](../v/volatility.md) in relation to the [market](../m/market.md).

### The Anomaly

Contrary to the CAPM, empirical evidence shows that portfolios of low-[volatility](../v/volatility.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) have historically delivered higher [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted returns than portfolios of high-[volatility](../v/volatility.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md). This is surprising because it implies that investors can achieve superior returns without taking on higher [risk](../r/risk.md).

## Historical Evidence

### Early Research

The Low [Volatility](../v/volatility.md) [Anomaly](../a/anomaly.md) was first documented by Robert Haugen and James Heins in the 1970s. They found that low-[volatility](../v/volatility.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) had higher average returns and lower [risk](../r/risk.md) compared to high-[volatility](../v/volatility.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md), challenging the prevailing [market efficiency](../m/market_efficiency.md) hypothesis.

### Subsequent Studies

Numerous studies have since confirmed and expanded upon these findings. For instance:
- **Baker, Bradley, and Wurgler (2011)** found that low-[volatility](../v/volatility.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) outperformed high-[volatility](../v/volatility.md) ones across 33 developed and emerging markets.
- **Ang, Hodrick, Xing, and Zhang (2006)** examined U.S. stock returns and discovered that low-[volatility](../v/volatility.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) consistently generated higher [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted returns than their high-[volatility](../v/volatility.md) counterparts.

### Global Perspective

The Low [Volatility](../v/volatility.md) [Anomaly](../a/anomaly.md) is not confined to any single [market](../m/market.md); it has been observed globally across different [asset](../a/asset.md) classes, including equities, bonds, and commodities.

## Explanations for the Anomaly

### Behavioral Finance

Several [behavioral finance](../b/behavioral_finance.md) theories have been proposed to explain the Low [Volatility](../v/volatility.md) [Anomaly](../a/anomaly.md):
- **Lottery Preferences**: Investors may overpay for high-[volatility](../v/volatility.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) with lottery-like payoff characteristics, expecting large gains despite their low probability. This leads to an overvaluation of high-[volatility](../v/volatility.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) and undervaluation of low-[volatility](../v/volatility.md) ones.
- **Overconfidence**: Overconfident investors may prefer volatile [stocks](../s/stock.md), believing they can time the [market](../m/market.md) or select outperforming [stocks](../s/stock.md), thereby pushing up prices of high-[volatility](../v/volatility.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md).
- **Benchmarking and Career Concerns**: [Fund](../f/fund.md) managers often [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) their performance against [market](../m/market.md) indices. To avoid underperformance relative to the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md), they might [overweight](../o/overweight.md) high-[volatility](../v/volatility.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md), which can move more sharply and quickly, hoping to match or exceed [market](../m/market.md) returns. This inflates the prices of high-[volatility](../v/volatility.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) and depresses the prices of low-[volatility](../v/volatility.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md).

### Market Structure

[Market](../m/market.md) structure-related reasons also contribute to the Low [Volatility](../v/volatility.md) [Anomaly](../a/anomaly.md):
- **[Leverage](../l/leverage.md) Constraints**: Many institutional investors face constraints on the use of [leverage](../l/leverage.md). Since low-[volatility](../v/volatility.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) naturally [offer](../o/offer.md) lower returns, these investors may avoid them in favor of riskier, higher-[return](../r/return.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md). This preference drives up the prices of high-[volatility](../v/volatility.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) and suppresses those of low-[volatility](../v/volatility.md) ones.
- **Institutional Mandates**: Investment mandates and guidelines might prevent certain investors from fully exploiting low-[volatility](../v/volatility.md) opportunities. For instance, many funds are mandated to stay fully invested, limiting their ability to tilt heavily toward low-[volatility](../v/volatility.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md).

## Investment Strategies

### Low Volatility Strategies

Investment strategies based on the Low [Volatility](../v/volatility.md) [Anomaly](../a/anomaly.md) typically involve constructing portfolios of low-[volatility](../v/volatility.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) with the expectation of achieving higher [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted returns. Some common approaches include:

- **Minimum [Volatility](../v/volatility.md) Portfolios**: These portfolios are constructed to minimize total portfolio [volatility](../v/volatility.md). This approach may involve using mathematical [optimization](../o/optimization.md) techniques to select a combination of [stocks](../s/stock.md) that produce the lowest possible [volatility](../v/volatility.md) for a given [return](../r/return.md) level.
- **[Risk Parity](../r/risk_parity.md)**: This strategy divides investment [capital](../c/capital.md) among [asset](../a/asset.md) classes such that each contributes equally to the overall portfolio [risk](../r/risk.md). It often results in a significant allocation to low-[volatility](../v/volatility.md) assets.
- **Low-[Volatility](../v/volatility.md) [Factor Investing](../f/factor_investing.md)**: This approach involves selecting [stocks](../s/stock.md) based on their [volatility](../v/volatility.md) characteristics, often using factors like [historical volatility](../h/historical_volatility.md) or [beta](../b/beta.md) to identify low-[volatility](../v/volatility.md) candidates.

### ETF and Fund Offerings

Many financial institutions [offer](../o/offer.md) products designed to exploit the Low [Volatility](../v/volatility.md) [Anomaly](../a/anomaly.md), including [Exchange](../e/exchange.md)-Traded Funds (ETFs) and mutual funds. Some notable examples include:

- **[iShares](../i/ishares.md) Edge MSCI Minimum [Volatility](../v/volatility.md) USA ETF (USMV)**: This ETF aims to provide exposure to U.S. [stocks](../s/stock.md) with lower [volatility](../v/volatility.md) characteristics.
- **Invesco S&P 500 Low [Volatility](../v/volatility.md) ETF (SPLV)**: This ETF focuses on the 100 least volatile [stocks](../s/stock.md) in the S&P 500 [Index](../i/index_instrument.md).
- **PowerShares S&P International Developed Low [Volatility](../v/volatility.md) Portfolio (IDLV)**: This ETF targets low-[volatility](../v/volatility.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) in developed markets outside the U.S.

### Performance and Drawbacks

#### Performance

Low-[volatility](../v/volatility.md) strategies have generally performed well, particularly during periods of [market](../m/market.md) stress or downturns. They tend to exhibit less [drawdown](../d/drawdown.md) and provide a smoother [return](../r/return.md) profile compared to high-[volatility](../v/volatility.md) strategies.

#### Drawbacks

Despite their advantages, low-[volatility](../v/volatility.md) strategies are not without drawbacks:
- **Underperformance in [Bull](../b/bull.md) Markets**: In strongly rising markets, low-[volatility](../v/volatility.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) may [underperform](../u/underperform.md) their high-[volatility](../v/volatility.md) counterparts as [risk](../r/risk.md) appetite increases and investors chase higher returns.
- **Sector Concentration**: Low-[volatility](../v/volatility.md) portfolios may become concentrated in certain sectors, such as utilities or [consumer staples](../c/consumer_staples.md), which typically exhibit lower [volatility](../v/volatility.md).
- **Limited [Upside](../u/upside.md)**: While low-[volatility](../v/volatility.md) strategies aim to provide better [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted returns, they may [offer](../o/offer.md) limited [upside potential](../u/upside_potential_in_trading.md) during rapid [market](../m/market.md) upswings.

## Future Prospects

The enduring nature of the Low [Volatility](../v/volatility.md) [Anomaly](../a/anomaly.md) suggests it is likely to persist, but ongoing research is essential for better understanding its [underlying](../u/underlying.md) causes and for refining investment strategies. Furthermore, as more investors become aware of and seek to exploit the [anomaly](../a/anomaly.md), its efficacy could diminish over time due to increased competition and [market efficiency](../m/market_efficiency.md).

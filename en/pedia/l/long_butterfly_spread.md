# Long Butterfly Spread

The Long [Butterfly Spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md) is a sophisticated [options](../o/options.md) [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) used by experienced traders to benefit from low [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and the stability of an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price. The strategy aims to achieve a [profit](../p/profit.md) by correctly predicting that the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) [will](../w/will.md) remain close to a specific target price at expiration. This method is particularly useful in scenarios where the [trader](../t/trader.md) anticipates minimal movement in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

## Structure of a Long Butterfly Spread

A Long [Butterfly Spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md) involves three different strike prices and uses a combination of both calls or both puts. The structure comprises:

1. **Buying one lower strike option (long position)**
2. **Selling two middle strike [options](../o/options.md) (short position)**
3. **Buying one higher strike option (long position)**

This forms a "butterfly" shape in terms of the [profit](../p/profit.md)/loss diagram, with the maximum [profit](../p/profit.md) achieved at the middle [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) and bounded [risk](../r/risk.md) defined by the outer strike prices.

### Call Option Butterfly

Assume we have an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) currently priced at $100. To create a Call Long [Butterfly Spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md), a [trader](../t/trader.md) could:

- **Buy 1 Call with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $90** (lower strike)
- **Sell 2 Calls with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $100** (middle strike)
- **Buy 1 Call with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $110** (higher strike)

### Put Option Butterfly

Alternatively, with the same [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) priced at $100, a [trader](../t/trader.md) could also set up a Put Long [Butterfly Spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md):

- **Buy 1 Put with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $90** (lower strike)
- **Sell 2 Puts with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $100** (middle strike)
- **Buy 1 Put with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $110** (higher strike)

## Profit and Loss Potential

The maximum [profit](../p/profit.md), maximum loss, and breakeven points can be predetermined, which makes the [butterfly spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md) an attractive strategy for traders seeking defined outcomes.

### Maximum Profit

The maximum [profit](../p/profit.md) is achieved if the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price is exactly at the middle [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) at expiration. This can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Max Profit} = \text{Middle [Strike Price](../s/strike_price.md)} - \text{Lower [Strike Price](../s/strike_price.md)} - \text{[Net Premium](../n/net_premium.md) Paid} \]

### Maximum Loss

The maximum loss occurs if the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price is either below the lower [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) or above the higher [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) at expiration. This is limited to the [net premium](../n/net_premium.md) paid for the strategy.

\[ \text{Max Loss} = \text{[Net Premium](../n/net_premium.md) Paid} \]

### Breakeven Points

There are two breakeven points for a Long [Butterfly Spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md):

1. **Lower [Breakeven Point](../b/breakeven_point.md):**
   \[ \text{Lower [Strike Price](../s/strike_price.md)} + \text{[Net Premium](../n/net_premium.md) Paid} \]

2. **Higher [Breakeven Point](../b/breakeven_point.md):**
   \[ \text{Higher [Strike Price](../s/strike_price.md)} - \text{[Net Premium](../n/net_premium.md) Paid} \]

## Advantages of Long Butterfly Spread

1. **Limited [Risk](../r/risk.md):** The potential loss is limited to the [net premium](../n/net_premium.md) paid.
2. **Defined [Profit](../p/profit.md):** The maximum [profit](../p/profit.md), although limited, is clearly defined.
3. **[Neutral](../n/neutral.md) to Low [Volatility](../v/volatility.md):** Suitable for markets expected to have low [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

## Disadvantages of Long Butterfly Spread

1. **Limited [Profit](../p/profit.md) [Range](../r/range.md):** The strategy offers limited [profit](../p/profit.md) potential compared to other strategies.
2. **Commissions:** [Multiple](../m/multiple.md) legs in the strategy may result in higher [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md).
3. **Complexity:** The structure is more complex than simple option strategies, requiring more expertise and management.

## Conclusion

The Long [Butterfly Spread](../b/butterfly_spread.md) strategy is an advanced [options](../o/options.md) trading method designed for scenarios of low [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and stable [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) prices. By carefully structuring the spread and understanding the [profit](../p/profit.md)/loss dynamics, traders can efficiently use this strategy to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on predicted [market](../m/market.md) conditions while keeping risks manageable and predefined.

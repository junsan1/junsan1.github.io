# Linear Models

In the context of financial markets and [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), linear models are a cornerstone for predicting prices, modeling risks, and optimizing [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). Linear models refer to a broad category of approaches that can be summarized by the concept that the best-fitting relationship between a dependent variable (e.g., the price of a stock) and one or more independent variables (predictors, such as time, various [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md), or other stock prices) is a linear function. This discussion will encompass the primary types of linear models used in trading, their practical applications, and the inherent benefits and limitations they present.

## Linear Regression

**[Linear regression](../l/linear_regression.md)** is the most fundamental approach to modeling the relationship between variables. In the context of trading, [linear regression](../l/linear_regression.md) can be used for forecasting future prices based on historical price data and external factors. The general form of a simple [linear regression](../l/linear_regression.md) model is

\[ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon \]

where:
- \( y \) is the dependent variable (e.g., stock price),
- \( x \) is the independent variable (e.g., time, volume of traded shares),
- \( \beta_0 \) is the intercept,
- \( \beta_1 \) is the slope of the line (which indicates the change in \( y \) for a unit change in \( x \)),
- \( \epsilon \) is the error term.

### Application in Trading

In practical trading, [linear regression](../l/linear_regression.md) can be used for:
1. **Price Prediction**: By using historical prices (as \( x \)) to predict future prices (as \( y \)).
2. **[Pairs Trading](../p/pairs_trading.md)**: Involves comparing two correlated assets. A [linear regression](../l/linear_regression.md) between the prices of two stocks can identify divergences to exploit.
3. **[Factor Models](../f/factor_models.md)**: [Linear regression](../l/linear_regression.md) can help disentangle the impact of various factors (interest rates, [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md)) on asset prices.

**Example**:
Let's assume a trader wishes to predict the price of a stock \( y \) based on its past prices. By fitting a linear model:

\[ \text{Price\_Today} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{Price\_Yesterday} + \epsilon \]

The trader can estimate the coefficients \( \beta_0 \) and \( \beta_1 \) through historical data and use them to predict future stock prices.

## Multiple Linear Regression

**Multiple [linear regression](../l/linear_regression.md)** extends simple [linear regression](../l/linear_regression.md) by incorporating multiple independent variables. This model is useful for understanding how various factors, in combination, impact a stock's price. The general form of a multiple [linear regression](../l/linear_regression.md) model is:

\[ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + ... + \beta_n x_n + \epsilon \]

where \( x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \) are the multiple predictors.

### Application in Trading

Multiple [linear regression](../l/linear_regression.md) is beneficial in:
1. **[Factor Investing](../f/factor_investing.md)**: Incorporating multiple [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md) and company fundamentals to predict stock returns.
2. **Market Risk Models (CAPM, Fama-French)**: Using factors like market return, size, and value to explain asset returns.
3. **[Portfolio Optimization](../p/portfolio_optimization.md)**: Assessing the impact of various factors on portfolio returns and optimizing [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md).

**Example**:
A trader might use multiple factors such as GDP growth rates, interest rates, and industry-specific indices to predict stock returns:

\[ \text{Price\_Tomorrow} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{GDP\_Growth} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{Interest\_Rate} + \beta_3 \cdot \text{Industry\_Index} + \epsilon \]

## Autoregressive Models (AR)

**Autoregressive (AR) models** are a type of linear model where the current value of a time series is explained by its previous values. In AR models, future values of a time-series are expressed linearly based on its past values, often under the assumption that past trends can forecast future values.

The general form of an AR model of order \( p \) (AR(p)) is:

\[ y_t = \phi_1 y_{t-1} + \phi_2 y_{t-2} + ... + \phi_p y_{t-p} + \epsilon_t \]

where:
- \( y_t \) is the value of the series at time \( t \),
- \( \phi_1, \phi_2, ..., \phi_p \) are the parameters (coefficients),
- \( \epsilon_t \) is white noise error term,
- \( p \) is the order of the autoregressive model.

### Application in Trading

AR models are used in:
1. **[Time Series Forecasting](../t/time_series_forecasting.md)**: [Trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md) use [historical price patterns](../h/historical_price_patterns.md) to predict future movements.
2. **[Technical Analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md)**: Identifying patterns and trends for trading decisions.

**Example**:
For [day trading](../d/day_trading.md), predicting today's closing price \( y_t \) using the prices from the previous two days:

\[ y_t = \phi_1 \cdot y_{t-1} + \phi_2 \cdot y_{t-2} + \epsilon_t \]

## Vector Autoregressive Models (VAR)

**Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models** generalize the univariate AR model to capture the linear interdependencies among multiple time series. In VAR models, each variable is a linear function of the past values of itself and all the other variables in the system.

The general form of a VAR model of order \( p \) (VAR(p)) for \( k \) time series variables \( y_{1,t}, y_{2,t}, ... , y_{k,t} \) is:

\[ y_t = c + A_1 y_{t-1} + A_2 y_{t-2} + ... + A_p y_{t-p} + \epsilon_t \]

where:
- \( y_t \) is a vector of the k variables at time t.
- \( c \) is a vector of constants (intercepts),
- \( A_1, A_2, ..., A_p \) are matrices of coefficients,
- \( \epsilon_t \) is a vector of error terms.

### Application in Trading

VAR models are used in:
1. **Interrelated Markets Analysis**: Studying relationships and interactions between different markets (e.g., stock and bond markets).
2. **Macroeconomic Factor Impact**: Understanding how macroeconomic variables jointly impact asset prices.

**Example**:
Analyzing the relationship between stock prices \( x_t \) and another economic indicator \( z_t \):

\[ 
\begin{bmatrix}
x_t \\
z_t
\end{bmatrix}
=
c + A_1 
\begin{bmatrix}
x_{t-1} \\
z_{t-1}
\end{bmatrix}
+ \epsilon_t 
\]

## Ridge Regression

**Ridge regression** or **Tikhonov regularization** is a technique used to address multicollinearity in [linear regression](../l/linear_regression.md). It introduces a penalty term to the loss function used to estimate the regression coefficients, preventing overfitting by shrinking coefficients towards zero.

The ridge regression modifies the loss function in [linear regression](../l/linear_regression.md) to:

\[ L(\beta) = \sum (y_i - \hat{y_i})^2 + \lambda \sum \beta_j^2 \]

where:
- \( L(\beta) \) is the loss function,
- \( \lambda \) is the regularization parameter, determining the penalty,
- \( \beta_j \) are the model coefficients.

### Application in Trading

Ridge regression is useful when:
1. **Handling Multicollinearity**: When independent variables are highly correlated, ridge regression stabilizes the estimates.
2. **High-dimensional Data**: When the number of predictors is large.

**Example**:
To predict stock returns by incorporating a large set of [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md):

\[ \text{Return} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{GDP\_Growth} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{Interest\_Rate} + \beta_3 \cdot \text{Index1} + ... + \lambda \sum \beta_j^2 \]

## Lasso Regression

**Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression** is another approach to regularization. It includes an L1 penalty, which leads to sparse solutions where some coefficients are exactly zero, thus performing variable selection.

The lasso loss function is:

\[ L(\beta) = \sum (y_i - \hat{y_i})^2 + \lambda \sum |\beta_j| \]

### Application in Trading

Lasso regression is used in:
1. **Feature Selection**: Selection of relevant predictors among a large set by shrinking insignificant ones to zero.
2. **Sparse Modeling**: Simplifying models by eliminating less important features.

**Example**:
Identifying the most relevant indicators for stock price predictions among numerous potential factors:

\[ \text{Return} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{GDP\_Growth} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{Interest\_Rate} + \beta_3 \cdot \text{Index1} + ... + \lambda \sum |\beta_j| \]

## Elastic Net

**Elastic Net** combines the penalties of ridge regression and lasso regression. 

It addresses limitations when the number of predictors exceeds the number of samples or when predictors are highly correlated.

The elastic net loss function is:

\[ L(\beta) = \sum (y_i - \hat{y_i})^2 + \lambda_1 \sum |\beta_j| + \lambda_2 \sum \beta_j^2 \]

### Application in Trading

Elastic Net is optimal when:
1. **High-dimensional Data**: Managing datasets with a large number of predictors.
2. **Handling Correlated Predictors**: Combining the strengths of lasso and ridge regression to handle multicollinearity and select variables.

**Example**:
[Predictive modeling](../p/predictive_modeling.md) for stocks with numerous [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md), combining the strengths of ridge and lasso:

\[ \text{Return} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{GDP\_Growth} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{Interest\_Rate} + \beta_3 \cdot \text{Index1} + ... + \lambda_1 \sum |\beta_j| + \lambda_2 \sum \beta_j^2 \]

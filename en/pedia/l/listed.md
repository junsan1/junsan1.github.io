# Listed

## Definition
**Listed** refers to a company's [shares](../s/shares.md) being officially admitted to [trade](../t/trade.md) on a recognized stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md). When a company's [shares](../s/shares.md) are listed, they are available for purchase and [sale](../s/sale.md) by the general public on that [exchange](../e/exchange.md).

## Key Components
1. **Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md)**: A marketplace where securities, including [stocks](../s/stock.md) and bonds, are bought and sold. Examples include the New York Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (NYSE), [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md), London Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (LSE), and Tokyo Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (TSE).
2. **Public Trading**: Listed [shares](../s/shares.md) are available for trading by the general public, allowing investors to buy and sell [shares](../s/shares.md) of the company.
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Companies must meet specific regulatory requirements and adhere to ongoing [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md) to maintain their listed status.

## Importance
1. **[Capital](../c/capital.md) Raising**: Listing provides companies with access to a broad pool of investors, facilitating [capital](../c/capital.md) raising through the [sale](../s/sale.md) of [shares](../s/shares.md).
2. **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)**: Listed [shares](../s/shares.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), allowing shareholders to buy and sell their [shares](../s/shares.md) easily in the public [market](../m/market.md).
3. **[Visibility](../v/visibility.md) and Credibility**: Being listed on a major stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md) enhances a company's [visibility](../v/visibility.md), credibility, and reputation among investors and stakeholders.

## Example Scenarios
1. **Initial Public [Offering](../o/offering.md) (IPO)**: A [private company](../p/private_company.md) decides to go public by [offering](../o/offering.md) its [shares](../s/shares.md) to the public for the first time on a stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md).
2. **Secondary Listing**: A company already listed on one stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md) seeks a secondary listing on another [exchange](../e/exchange.md) to access a broader [investor](../i/investor.md) base.
3. **Compliance**: A listed company regularly files financial reports and disclosures with the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) to comply with regulatory requirements.

## Listing Requirements
1. **Financial Standards**: Companies must meet minimum financial criteria, such as [revenue](../r/revenue.md), [profit](../p/profit.md), and [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) thresholds.
2. **[Corporate Governance](../c/corporate_governance.md)**: Companies must adhere to specific [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) standards, including having an independent board of directors and transparent management practices.
3. **[Disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) [Obligations](../o/obligation.md)**: Companies are required to provide regular [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md), annual reports, and other material disclosures to the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) and the public.

## Types of Listings
1. **Primary Listing**: The main stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md) where a company's [shares](../s/shares.md) are initially listed and traded.
2. **Secondary Listing**: An additional listing on another stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md) to increase the company's exposure to international investors.
3. **[Dual Listing](../d/dual_listing.md)**: A company is listed on two stock exchanges simultaneously, often in different countries.

## Challenges
1. **Regulatory Compliance**: Maintaining compliance with the stringent regulatory requirements of stock exchanges can be challenging and costly.
2. **[Market](../m/market.md) [Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: Listed companies are subject to [market](../m/market.md) fluctuations, which can impact their share price and [valuation](../v/valuation.md).
3. **Public Scrutiny**: Listed companies face increased scrutiny from investors, analysts, and regulators, requiring high levels of [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and accountability.

## Best Practices
1. **Strong Governance**: Implement [robust](../r/robust.md) [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) practices to ensure [transparency](../t/transparency.md), accountability, and compliance with regulatory standards.
2. **Regular Communication**: Maintain clear and consistent communication with shareholders and the public to build [trust](../t/trust.md) and confidence.
3. **Financial Management**: Ensure accurate and timely financial reporting to meet [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md) and support informed decision-making by investors.
4. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Develop and implement [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) strategies to mitigate the impact of [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and regulatory changes.

## Conclusion
Being listed on a stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md) signifies that a company's [shares](../s/shares.md) are available for public trading and that the company meets the regulatory and financial standards of the [exchange](../e/exchange.md). Listing provides numerous benefits, including access to [capital](../c/capital.md), [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) for shareholders, and enhanced [visibility](../v/visibility.md). However, it also comes with challenges such as regulatory compliance and public scrutiny. Understanding the key components, types, challenges, and [best practices](../b/best_practices.md) associated with being listed can help companies and investors navigate the public [market](../m/market.md) effectively.

# Leading Economic Index (LEI)

The Leading Economic [Index](../i/index.md) (LEI) is a composite [index](../i/index.md) published monthly by the Conference Board, an independent research association. It is designed to anticipate changes in the [economic cycle](../e/economic_cycle.md) and forecast future economic activity. As a crucial tool in economic analysis, it aggregates [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md) that historically have moved before changes in the overall [economy](../e/economy.md), hence the term “leading.”

### Components of LEI

As of the latest methodology update, the LEI comprises ten components:

1. **Average weekly hours, [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md):** This gives insight into [labor market](../l/labor_market.md) conditions. An increase usually indicates that employers are [gearing](../g/gearing.md) up for higher [demand](../d/demand.md).
2. **Average weekly initial claims for [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) [insurance](../i/insurance.md):** This is a measure of layoffs. A rise usually suggests weakening economic activity, while a fall implies an improvement.
3. **Manufacturers' new orders, [consumer goods](../c/consumer_goods.md) and materials:** Increased new orders can indicate higher production levels in the future.
4. **ISM [Index](../i/index.md) of New Orders:** The Institute for [Supply](../s/supply.md) Management’s [index](../i/index.md) provides insights into [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) sector activities and future production.
5. **Manufacturers' new orders, non-defense [capital goods](../c/capital_goods.md) excluding aircraft:** This often signals future [business](../b/business.md) investment.
6. **Building permits, new private housing units:** Housing sector activity is a major economic driver; more permits suggest future construction activity.
7. **Stock prices, 500 common [stocks](../s/stock.md):** [Stock market](../s/stock_market.md) performance can reflect [investor](../i/investor.md) sentiment and future economic expectations.
8. **Leading [Credit](../c/credit.md) [Index](../i/index.md):** Comprised of six financial indicators, it provides information on the state of the [credit](../c/credit.md) markets.
9. **[Interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) spread, 10-year Treasury bonds less [federal funds](../f/federal_funds.md):** A larger spread generally indicates more [robust](../r/robust.md) future economic activity.
10. **Average consumer expectations for [business](../b/business.md) conditions:** This leverages components of consumer confidence surveys.

### Purpose and Use

The LEI's primary purpose is to predict economic activity over the next 3 to 12 months by providing a broad view that combines various [leading indicators](../l/leading_indicators.md). It is particularly useful for identifying turning points in the [economy](../e/economy.md), such as troughs and peaks. Economists, businesses, and policymakers use the LEI for purposes such as:

- **[Economic Forecasting](../e/economic_forecasting.md):** Analysts integrate LEI data into economic models to enhance their forecasts.
- **[Business](../b/business.md) Planning:** Corporations and businesses utilize the LEI to strategize investments, production, staffing, and other planning efforts.
- **Policy Formulation:** Policymakers, including central banks and government agencies, monitor the LEI to gauge the need for adjustments in economic policies or interventions.

### Methodology

The Conference Board periodically reviews and updates the methodology of the LEI to ensure it captures the most relevant [leading indicators](../l/leading_indicators.md). The methodology involves several steps:

1. **Selection of Components:** Indicators are selected based on economic theory, empirical results, and statistical robustness.
2. **Normalization and Smoothing:** Data are normalized to account for different magnitudes and smoothed to reduce [volatility](../v/volatility.md).
3. **Weight [Assignment](../a/assignment.md):** Each component is assigned a weight, typically based on its historical [correlation](../c/correlation.md) with future economic activity.
4. **Composite Construction:** The final composite [index](../i/index.md) is calculated as a [weighted average](../w/weighted_average.md) of the normalized, smoothed components.

### Historical Performance

Historically, the LEI has been a reliable predictive tool for identifying economic phases. For example, it successfully signaled the onset of several recessions, including the global [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) of 2007-2008. However, it is important to [note](../n/note.md) that while the LEI is a useful tool, it is not infallible and occasionally produces [false signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md).

### Inflation and LEI

One of the critical interactions is between the LEI and [inflation](../i/inflation.md) trends. Generally, an improving LEI suggests rising economic activity, which can put upward pressure on prices. Conversely, declining LEI figures could signal weaker [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) and potential disinflationary trends. Central banks closely monitor these dynamics to balance growth and [inflation](../i/inflation.md) targets.

### Recent Trends

As of the most recent reports, the LEI in the United States has shown mixed signals post the COVID-19 pandemic recovery. While some indicators such as stock prices and new orders have rebounded strongly, others like building permits and average weekly hours have been more volatile, reflecting ongoing uncertainties in global [supply](../s/supply.md) chains and labor markets.

### Global Variants

While the Conference Board’s LEI for the United States is the most widely known, there are similar indices for other economies which also serve as [leading indicators](../l/leading_indicators.md) for their respective [economic cycles](../e/economic_cycles.md). Examples include:
- **UK LEI:** Similar to its US counterpart, it includes components like [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) orders, housing permits, and [financial market indicators](../f/financial_market_indicators.md).
- **[Euro](../e/euro.md) Area LEI:** Covers major economies within the [Eurozone](../e/eurozone.md) and includes a blend of industrial, financial, and [business](../b/business.md) confidence indicators.
- **China LEI:** Focuses on elements such as [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) activity, [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) output, and consumer expectations.

### Criticisms and Limitations

Despite its widespread use, the LEI is not without criticisms:
- **Lag Effect:** Some argue that the publication lag reduces its effectiveness in real-time decision-making.
- **Component Changes:** Frequent revisions to component methodologies can introduce inconsistencies over time.
- **Data Revisions:** Updates and revisions to [underlying](../u/underlying.md) data can result in retrospective changes to the LEI, complicating [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) and historical analysis.

### Conclusion

The Leading Economic [Index](../i/index.md) is an invaluable tool for predicting economic activity, [offering](../o/offering.md) a synthesis of various leading [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md) into a single, cohesive measure. Its broad application across [economic forecasting](../e/economic_forecasting.md), [business](../b/business.md) planning, and policy formulation underscores its significance. However, users must be cautious of its limitations and use it in conjunction with other analytical tools for the best results.

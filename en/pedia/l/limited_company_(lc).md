# Limited Company (LC)

A Limited Company (LC) is a form of business structure that provides its owners, or shareholders, with limited liability. This means that the shareholders' personal assets are protected in case the company incurs debt or faces legal action. A limited company is considered a separate legal entity from its owners, which means it can enter into contracts, own property, and be sued in its own name.

## Types of Limited Companies

Limited companies can be classified into various types based on ownership, liability, and regulatory requirements. The primary types of limited companies include:

1. **Private Company Limited by Shares (Ltd or Pvt Ltd)**: The most common type, where shareholders' liability is limited to the amount unpaid on their shares.
2. **Public Limited Company (PLC)**: A company that can sell shares to the public and is typically listed on a stock exchange.
3. **Company Limited by Guarantee (CLG)**: Often used by non-profit organizations, where members' liability is limited to the amount they guarantee to contribute if the company is wound up.
4. **Limited Liability Company (LLC)**: A blend of a corporation and a partnership, commonly used in the United States.

# Limited Company (LC)

A Limited Company (LC) is a form of [business](../b/business.md) structure that provides its owners, or shareholders, with [limited liability](../l/limited_liability.md). This means that the shareholders' personal assets are protected in case the company incurs [debt](../d/debt.md) or faces legal action. A limited company is considered a separate legal entity from its owners, which means it can enter into contracts, own property, and be sued in its own name.

## Types of Limited Companies

Limited companies can be classified into various types based on ownership, [liability](../l/liability.md), and regulatory requirements. The primary types of limited companies include:

1. **[Private Company](../p/private_company.md) Limited by [Shares](../s/shares.md) (Ltd or Pvt Ltd)**: The most common type, where shareholders' [liability](../l/liability.md) is limited to the amount unpaid on their [shares](../s/shares.md).
2. **Public Limited Company (PLC)**: A company that can sell [shares](../s/shares.md) to the public and is typically [listed](../l/listed.md) on a stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md).

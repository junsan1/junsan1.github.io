# Larry Ellison

Lawrence Joseph “Larry” Ellison is an American [entrepreneur](../e/entrepreneur.md), billionaire, and philanthropist known primarily for his role as co-founder, former CEO, and current Chairman of Oracle [Corporation](../c/corporation.md), a globally renowned technology company. Born on August 17, 1944, in New York City, Ellison's journey from a modest childhood to becoming one of the wealthiest and most influential figures in technology is nothing short of remarkable. This comprehensive overview examines his early life, career, and contributions to technology and society.

## Early Life and Education

Larry Ellison was born to an unwed Jewish mother. His biological father was an Italian-American U.S. Air Force pilot. Soon after his birth, he was given to his aunt and uncle for adoption and was raised in a middle-class Jewish family in Chicago’s South Shore neighborhood. Ellison's adoptive father, Louis Ellison, was a modestly successful [accountant](../a/accountant.md). Despite his achievements, Ellison described his father as distant and less than supportive.

Ellison attended South Shore High School and then enrolled at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. However, he did not graduate. After a second unsuccessful attempt at college at the University of Chicago, Ellison moved to California in the early 1960s.

## Career Beginnings

Upon moving to California, Ellison initially held several odd jobs, generally in the field of technology. He worked for companies like Ampex [Corporation](../c/corporation.md), where he learned about computer programming. His experience here laid the groundwork for his future ventures.

## Founding and Growth of Oracle Corporation

In 1977, Ellison co-founded Software Development Laboratories (SDL) with two partners, Robert Miner and Ed Oates, [investing](../i/investing.md) $1,200 of their own [money](../m/money.md). In 1979, the company was renamed Relational Software Inc. (RSI), and finally in 1982, it adopted the name Oracle [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) after their flagship product, the Oracle Database.

Oracle was the first database software to use SQL (Structured Query Language), a revolutionary feature that helped catapult it into commercial success.

### Technological Innovations

Oracle became known for its constant innovation in relational database management systems (RDBMS). They pioneered several cutting-edge technologies, such as multi-version read consistency, clustering, and in-database analytics. These advancements cemented Oracle’s reputation as an [industry](../i/industry.md) leader.

These acquisitions helped Oracle adapt to changing [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md) and maintain its competitive edge.

## Departure as CEO and Continued Influence

In 2014, Ellison stepped down as CEO, passing the torch to co-CEOs Safra Catz and Mark Hurd.

# Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a classification and [dimensionality reduction](../d/dimensionality_reduction_in_trading.md) technique that finds a linear combination of features to separate two or more classes of objects or events. It is used extensively in statistics, [pattern recognition](../p/pattern_recognition.md), and machine learning. In the context of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), LDA can be utilized for developing [predictive models](../p/predictive_models_in_trading.md) that can accurately classify [financial time series](../f/financial_time_series.md) data, detect market regimes, or identify profitable [trading signals](../t/trading_signals.md).

## Overview of LDA

LDA aims to achieve three main objectives:
1. **Deterministic Separation**: LDA determines a hyperplane that best separates two or more classes.
2. **[Dimensionality Reduction](../d/dimensionality_reduction_in_trading.md)**: It reduces the dimensionality of the dataset by projecting it into a lower-dimensional space.
3. **Maximizing Class Separability**: By creating a new axis, LDA maximizes the distance between means of different classes while minimizing the variance within each class.

## Mathematical Foundation

LDA assumes that the input data follows a [Gaussian distribution](../g/gaussian_distribution.md) and that the classes have similar covariance matrices. Given a dataset with multiple features, \(\mathbf{X}\), and corresponding class labels, \(\mathbf{y}\), the steps for LDA are as follows:

1. **Compute the Mean Vectors**: Compute the mean vector for each class.
   \[
   \mathbf{m}_k = \frac{1}{N_k} \sum_{i=1}^{N_k} \mathbf{x}_i \quad \text{for each class} \ k
   \]

2. **Compute the Scatter Matrices**:
   - Within-class scatter matrix, \(S_W\):
     \[
     S_W = \sum_{k=1}^{c} \sum_{\mathbf{x}_i \in \mathcal{C}_k} (\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{m}_k)(\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{m}_k)^T
     \]
   - Between-class scatter matrix, \(S_B\):
     \[
     S_B = \sum_{k=1}^{c} N_k (\mathbf{m}_k - \mathbf{m})(\mathbf{m}_k - \mathbf{m})^T
     \]

3. **Compute the Linear Discriminants**: Solve the generalized eigenvalue problem to find the transformation vector, \(\mathbf{w}\):
   \[
   \mathbf{w} = \arg \max_{\mathbf{w}} \frac{\mathbf{w}^T S_B \mathbf{w}}{\mathbf{w}^T S_W \mathbf{w}}
   \]

4. **Transform the Dataset**: Project the dataset onto the new space to create the discriminant component(s).

## Application in Algorithmic Trading

### Stock Price Prediction

One of the critical applications of LDA in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) is predicting stock price movements. LDA can be employed to classify future returns (e.g., up or down) based on historical data. To develop a predictive model using LDA:
1. **Feature Engineering**: Create features from historical data such as prices, volumes, [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) (moving averages, RSI, MACD, etc.).
2. **Define Classes**: Define the classes based on future returns, labeling them as "up" or "down" depending on whether the return meets a particular threshold.
3. **Train LDA Model**: Train the LDA model using the historical features and the defined classes.
4. **Prediction and Signals**: Use the trained LDA model to predict the direction of future returns and generate [trading signals](../t/trading_signals.md).

### Market Regime Detection

Markets often exhibit different regimes characterized by varying levels of volatility, trends, and other market behaviors. Detecting these regimes can be crucial for developing adaptive [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). LDA can be used for regime classification:
1. **Identify Features**: Develop features that capture the essence of different market regimes such as volatility measures, [trend indicators](../t/trend_indicators.md), and economic factors.
2. **Define Regimes**: Label the historical periods into different regimes, such as "high volatility," "low volatility," "bull market," "bear market."
3. **Train LDA**: Train the LDA model to classify historical periods into the defined regimes based on the selected features.
4. **Regime Classification**: Use the LDA model to classify current and future market conditions into the detected regimes.

### Portfolio Management

LDA can also be applied in [portfolio management](../p/portfolio_management.md) for the purpose of asset classification and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md):
1. **Feature Extraction**: Extract features representing the financial characteristics of assets such as returns, risks, correlations, etc.
2. **Define Classes**: Categorize assets into different classes based on their risk profiles, e.g., "high risk," "medium risk," "low risk."
3. **Train the Model**: Use LDA to train a model on the historical features and risk classifications.
4. **Asset Classification**: Using the trained LDA model, classify new or existing assets into the defined risk categories, aiding in portfolio formation and rebalancing decisions.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages
- **Simplicity**: LDA is straightforward to implement and interpret.
- **Efficiency**: It is computationally efficient, making it suitable for large datasets.
- **[Dimensionality Reduction](../d/dimensionality_reduction_in_trading.md)**: LDA reduces the computational complexity by lowering the feature space.

### Disadvantages
- **Assumption of Normality**: LDA assumes that the data is normally distributed and classes have similar covariance matrices, which may not hold in all financial datasets.
- **Linear Boundaries**: The method assumes a linear separation of classes, limiting its effectiveness in complex, non-linear relationships typical in financial markets.

## Case Study: Applying LDA to S&P 500 Data

As a practical example, let's consider applying LDA to classify the direction of daily returns of the S&P 500 index. The steps involved are:
1. **Data Collection**: Collect historical daily prices for the S&P 500 index.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create features such as log returns, moving averages, volume changes, volatility measures, and [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md).
3. **Class Labeling**: Define two classes based on the future daily return; "up" if the return is positive, and "down" if the return is negative.
4. **Model Training**: Split the data into training and test sets. Train the LDA model using the training set.
5. **Prediction and Evaluation**: Apply the model to the test set to classify the returns. Evaluate the performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.discriminant_analysis import LinearDiscriminantAnalysis
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix

# Load the historical daily prices (assumed pre-loaded into a DataFrame `df`)
# df = pd.read_csv('sp500.csv')
df['Return'] = df['Close'].pct_change()
df['LogReturn'] = np.log(df['Close'] / df['Close'].shift(1))
df['SMA50'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
df['SMA200'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()
df = df.dropna()

# Define features and class labels
features = df[['LogReturn', 'SMA50', 'SMA200']]
labels = np.where(df['Return'] > 0, 1, 0)  # 1 for "up", 0 for "down"

# Split the data into training and test sets
train_size = int(0.8 * len(df))
X_train, X_test = features[:train_size], features[train_size:]
y_train, y_test = labels[:train_size], labels[train_size:]

# Train the LDA model
lda = LinearDiscriminantAnalysis()
lda.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = lda.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
print("Confusion Matrix:\n", cm)
```

In the above code, historical prices are loaded and features are engineered. The LDA model is trained on the training set and then tested on the test set. The accuracy and confusion matrix give insights into the model's performance.

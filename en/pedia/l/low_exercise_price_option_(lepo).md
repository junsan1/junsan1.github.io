# Low Exercise Price Option (LEPO)

A Low [Exercise Price](../e/excersise_price.md) Option (LEPO) is a special type of option contract that originated in Australia. Unlike standard option contracts that typically have strike prices near the current [market price](../m/market_price.md) of the [underlying security](../u/underlying_security.md), LEPOs are designed with an extremely low [exercise price](../e/excersise_price.md), often just a few cents. This structure makes the writing of LEPOs tantamount to taking on a position almost identical to owning the [underlying security](../u/underlying_security.md) itself. LEPOs are generally used in the context of [equity](../e/equity.md) markets, and they [offer](../o/offer.md) unique advantages and considerations for investors, particularly for those engaging in hedging or sophisticated [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

## Key Characteristics of LEPOs

### Low Exercise Price
The most defining characteristic of a LEPO is its [exercise price](../e/excersise_price.md), which is set at a very low level relative to the current [market value](../m/market_value.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). This effectively means that the [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) of a LEPO is nearly equal to the price of the [underlying security](../u/underlying_security.md) less this [nominal](../n/nominal.md) [exercise price](../e/excersise_price.md). 

### High Delta
Due to their low [exercise price](../e/excersise_price.md), LEPOs have a [delta](../d/delta.md) very close to 1. [Delta](../d/delta.md) is a measure of how much the price of an option changes with respect to the change in the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). A [delta](../d/delta.md) of nearly 1 means that the LEPO [will](../w/will.md) almost exactly replicate the movements of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

### No Time Value
Unlike regular [options](../o/options.md), LEPOs have minimal to no [time value](../t/time_value.md) component because the [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) dominates their pricing. This makes them attractive to investors looking for an instrument that closely mirrors the price movement of the [underlying security](../u/underlying_security.md) without the complexities introduced by [time decay](../t/time_decay.md).

### Margin Requirements
Due to their structure, trading LEPOs often requires lower [margin](../m/margin.md) compared to holding the actual stock, making it a cost-effective alternative for holding long [equity](../e/equity.md) positions.

### Settlement
LEPOs are typically European-style contracts, meaning they can only be exercised at expiration. They often settle in cash, and the settlement [value](../v/value.md) is based on the difference between the [market value](../m/market_value.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) and the low [exercise price](../e/excersise_price.md).

## Advantages of LEPOs

- **[Leverage](../l/leverage.md)**: LEPOs provide a form of [leverage](../l/leverage.md) without the need for borrowing, enabling investors to [gain](../g/gain.md) high exposure to the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) with a relatively small initial outlay.
  
- **Cost [Efficiency](../e/efficiency.md)**: Since LEPOs require lower [margin](../m/margin.md) compared to traditional stock purchases, they [offer](../o/offer.md) a more cost-effective means to [gain](../g/gain.md) exposure to [shares](../s/shares.md).

- **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Investors can use LEPOs to manage [risk](../r/risk.md), as these instruments can act as a [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against other positions in a portfolio.

- **Flexibility**: Provides almost the same benefit of holding the stock but with the added flexibility of [options trading strategies](../o/options_trading_strategies.md).

## Disadvantages of LEPOs

- **Complexity**: The unique structure of LEPOs can make them complicated to understand and use effectively for beginner investors.

- **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)**: Not all markets have high [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) for LEPOs, which can make buying and selling these instruments more difficult compared to standard [options](../o/options.md) or [stocks](../s/stock.md).

- **Narrow [Market](../m/market.md)**: LEPOs are primarily offered in specific markets, such as Australia, and may not be available or be less common in other regions.

## Practical Application

### Hedging
LEPOs can be an effective hedging tool. For instance, a [portfolio manager](../p/portfolio_manager.md) could buy LEPOs on a stock to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against short positions or to lock in gains without actually purchasing the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [shares](../s/shares.md). 

### Leveraged Bets
Due to the low [margin](../m/margin.md) requirement, traders can use LEPOs to make leveraged bets on the price movements of an [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock. If the stock price rises, the [value](../v/value.md) of the LEPO [will](../w/will.md) rise nearly equivalently, providing substantial returns on the [initial margin](../i/initial_margin.md).

### Portfolio Management
Portfolio managers and institutional investors may use LEPOs to rebalance portfolios more cost-effectively, taking advantage of the [leverage](../l/leverage.md) and low [capital](../c/capital.md) outlay required.

## Example of a LEPO

Let's consider an example to illustrate the use of a Low [Exercise Price](../e/excersise_price.md) Option:

- **Current Stock Price**: $100
- **LEPO [Exercise Price](../e/excersise_price.md)**: $0.01 (1 cent)
- **LEPO Price**: $99.99

In this scenario, purchasing a LEPO is nearly equivalent to buying the stock directly. If the stock price goes up to $110, the price of the LEPO would also increase to approximately $109.99. Therefore, the investment closely follows the performance of owning the stock itself.

## Regulatory Considerations

In different markets, LEPOs are subject to various regulatory standards. For example, in Australia, LEPOs were first introduced on the Australian Securities [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (ASX). They are regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments [Commission](../c/commission.md) (ASIC), which imposes specific rules regarding [margin](../m/margin.md), trading practices, and [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) requirements.

## Conclusion

LEPOs are a powerful [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md), providing investors with unique [leverage](../l/leverage.md), cost efficiencies, and hedging opportunities that are closely aligned with owning the [underlying security](../u/underlying_security.md). However, understanding the characteristics, benefits, and risks associated with LEPOs is crucial for those looking to incorporate them into their trading or investment strategies. Like any [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md), LEPOs should be used judiciously and in accordance with one's [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) and investment goals.

For more information on LEPOs and how to [trade](../t/trade.md) them, you can refer to the resources provided by financial exchanges and regulatory bodies. For example, the Australian Securities [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (ASX) offers comprehensive guides and updates on trading LEPOs: [ASX LEPO Guide](https://www.asx.com.au).

# Lapping Scheme

A lapping scheme is a form of [accounting](../a/accounting.md) [fraud](../f/fraud.md) typically implemented by an employee with access to both the accounts [receivable](../r/receivable.md) and the daily cash [receipts](../r/receipt.md) of a company. This scheme involves the deliberate misallocation of funds meant to cover outstanding receivables, with the goal of concealing an existing [shortfall](../s/shortfall.md) due to theft or error. The scheme’s primary intention is to cover up the theft of cash received from one [customer](../c/customer.md) by applying the [payment](../p/payment.md) made by another [customer](../c/customer.md) to the outstanding [receivable](../r/receivable.md) balance of the first.

## Mechanics of a Lapping Scheme

### Initial Setup
An employee responsible for handling accounts [receivable](../r/receivable.md) or cash [receipts](../r/receipt.md) begins by stealing a [payment](../p/payment.md) intended to settle a [customer](../c/customer.md) account. For example, if [Customer](../c/customer.md) A sends a [payment](../p/payment.md) of $1,000, the employee diverts that amount for personal use.

### Covering the Shortfall
To cover up the missing funds from [Customer](../c/customer.md) A’s account, the employee then takes a subsequent [payment](../p/payment.md) from [Customer](../c/customer.md) B and records it as a [payment](../p/payment.md) for [Customer](../c/customer.md) A’s account. This leaves [Customer](../c/customer.md) B’s [payment](../p/payment.md) unaccounted for.

### Continuing the Cycle
The employee must continue the pattern by taking a [payment](../p/payment.md) from [Customer](../c/customer.md) C to cover for [Customer](../c/customer.md) B, and so forth. This cycle continues indefinitely, as the employee needs to constantly shuffle funds around to prevent detection. This shell game can go on for a considerable time if not detected, especially in organizations with weak [internal controls](../i/internal_controls.md).

## Detection Methods

Detecting a lapping scheme can be challenging, but several methods can raise red flags:

### Discrepancies in Accounts Receivable
Consistent discrepancies between recorded payments and [bank deposits](../b/bank_deposits.md), or unusual delays in the [payment](../p/payment.md) application process, can indicate lapping. [Accounts receivable aging](../a/accounts_receivable_aging.md) reports may show accounts being settled irregularly or later than usual.

### Analytical Reviews
Regular analytical reviews, such as comparing the total daily deposits to the payments recorded in the accounts [receivable](../r/receivable.md) ledger, can help identify irregularities. A mismatch could signify that funds are being improperly applied or diverted.

### Segregation of Duties
A [robust](../r/robust.md) internal control system would segregate various responsibilities among different employees, ensuring that no single employee has control over [multiple](../m/multiple.md) stages of a financial [transaction](../t/transaction.md), such as receiving payments, recording transactions, and reconciling accounts.

### Surprise Audits
Frequent and unexpected audits can also help uncover lapping schemes. By reviewing and matching invoices, account statements, and payments unannounced, auditors can detect inconsistencies that may highlight lapping.

### Customer Confirmations
[Customer](../c/customer.md) confirmations involve directly contacting customers to verify the amounts they have paid and the balances recorded on their accounts. Discrepancies uncovered through these confirmations can help identify lapping.

## Example Scenario

Consider a scenario where an employee, Jane, handles both accounts [receivable](../r/receivable.md) and cash [receipts](../r/receipt.md) for a small company. Jane accepts a $500 [payment](../p/payment.md) from [Customer](../c/customer.md) A but uses the [money](../m/money.md) for herself. When [Customer](../c/customer.md) B sends a $600 [payment](../p/payment.md), Jane records $500 of it to [Customer](../c/customer.md) A's account and uses the remaining $100 for herself. As a result, [Customer](../c/customer.md) B’s balance remains unpaid. Jane must continually redirect funds to cover the [shortfall](../s/shortfall.md), creating an ongoing cycle.

## Implications of Lapping Scheme

The implications of a lapping scheme can be far-reaching and damaging:

### Financial Losses
Direct financial losses occur from the theft of cash. Additionally, the company might incur costs related to investigating and resolving the [fraud](../f/fraud.md).

### Reputational Damage
The company's reputation can be severely affected, leading to lost customers, [business](../b/business.md) partners, and [market](../m/market.md) [trust](../t/trust.md). Rebuilding [trust](../t/trust.md) can be a long and arduous process.

### Legal Consequences
The employee committing the [fraud](../f/fraud.md) faces legal repercussions, including potential criminal charges and civil liabilities.

### Operational Disruption
Detecting and addressing a lapping scheme can divert significant resources and attention from regular [business](../b/business.md) operations.

## Preventative Measures

Organizations can implement several measures to prevent lapping schemes:

### Robust Internal Controls
Effective [internal controls](../i/internal_controls.md), such as segregating duties, limiting access to financial systems, and requiring regular reconciliations, can prevent opportunities for lapping.

### Staff Training
Regular training sessions on ethical behavior and [fraud](../f/fraud.md) detection can educate employees on the consequences and signs of lapping, promoting a culture of integrity.

### Regular Audits
Regular internal and external audits can help identify irregularities early and act as a deterrent.

### Use of Technology
Deploying advanced [accounting](../a/accounting.md) software with built-in [fraud](../f/fraud.md) detection mechanisms can provide an additional layer of protection.

## Real-World Case Studies

### ZZZZ Best, Inc.
[ZZZZ Best](../z/zzzz_best.md), a historical example of a massive financial [fraud](../f/fraud.md), involved a complex lapping scheme. The company’s founder, Barry Minkow, diverted funds meant for various [customer](../c/customer.md) accounts, ultimately leading to its collapse and Minkow’s imprisonment.

### Washington Inventory Service
Employees at Washington [Inventory](../i/inventory.md) Service used lapping to cover up cash thefts for years. The [fraud](../f/fraud.md) was eventually discovered through rigorous audit procedures, highlighting the importance of consistent and thorough verification processes.

## Conclusion

A lapping scheme, while deceptively simple, can cause significant financial and reputational damage if not detected and addressed promptly. Organizations must employ [robust](../r/robust.md) [internal controls](../i/internal_controls.md), conduct regular audits, and foster a culture of integrity to mitigate the risks associated with such fraudulent activities. By remaining vigilant and transparent, businesses can protect themselves from the potentially devastating effects of a lapping scheme.

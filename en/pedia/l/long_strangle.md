# Long Strangle

In the realm of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), a "Long [Strangle](../s/strangle.md)" is a versatile [options](../o/options.md) strategy employed by traders to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on significant price movements in an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), without the need to predict the direction of the movement. This strategy involves purchasing both a [call option](../c/call_option.md) and a [put option](../p/put.md) with different strike prices, but with the same [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md). The essential goal of the Long [Strangle](../s/strangle.md) strategy is to [profit](../p/profit.md) from [volatility](../v/volatility.md) rather than the price direction of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

## How Long Strangle Works

To create a Long [Strangle](../s/strangle.md), a [trader](../t/trader.md) buys one out-of-the-[money](../m/money.md) (OTM) [call option](../c/call_option.md) and one out-of-the-[money](../m/money.md) [put option](../p/put.md). These [options](../o/options.md) contracts are about the same [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) and have the same [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md) but different strike prices. Here's a breakdown of how each component works:

1. **[Call Option](../c/call_option.md)**: A [call option](../c/call_option.md) gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) before the option expires. In a Long [Strangle](../s/strangle.md), the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of the [call option](../c/call_option.md) is higher than the current trading price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

2. **[Put Option](../p/put.md)**: A [put option](../p/put.md) provides the holder with the right, but not the obligation, to sell the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) before expiration. In a Long [Strangle](../s/strangle.md), the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of the [put option](../p/put.md) is lower than the current trading price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

### Example

Assume a [trader](../t/trader.md) is looking at a stock currently trading at $100. To implement a Long [Strangle](../s/strangle.md), the [trader](../t/trader.md) could:

- Purchase a [call option](../c/call_option.md) with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $110.
- Purchase a [put option](../p/put.md) with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $90.

Both [options](../o/options.md) have the same [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md). The [premium](../p/premium.md) paid for these [options](../o/options.md) represents the [trader](../t/trader.md)'s total investment in the Long [Strangle](../s/strangle.md) strategy.

## Payoff Structure

The payoff structure of a Long [Strangle](../s/strangle.md) is distinctive and directly linked to the [volatility](../v/volatility.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md):

- **If the price increases** significantly above the [call option](../c/call_option.md)'s [strike price](../s/strike_price.md), the [trader](../t/trader.md) can [exercise](../e/exercise.md) the [call option](../c/call_option.md) to buy the [asset](../a/asset.md) at the lower [strike price](../s/strike_price.md), then sell it at the current [market price](../m/market_price.md), capitalizing on the difference.
- **If the price decreases** significantly below the [put option](../p/put.md)'s [strike price](../s/strike_price.md), the [trader](../t/trader.md) can [exercise](../e/exercise.md) the [put option](../p/put.md) to sell the [asset](../a/asset.md) at the higher [strike price](../s/strike_price.md), then repurchase it at the current [market price](../m/market_price.md), again profiting from the discrepancy.
- **If the price remains stable** and does not move significantly, both [options](../o/options.md) expire worthless, leading to a loss limited to the total [premium](../p/premium.md) paid for buying the [options](../o/options.md).

### Breakeven Points

1. **Upper [Breakeven Point](../b/breakeven_point.md)**: [Strike Price](../s/strike_price.md) of [Call Option](../c/call_option.md) + Total [Premium](../p/premium.md) Paid.
2. **Lower [Breakeven Point](../b/breakeven_point.md)**: [Strike Price](../s/strike_price.md) of [Put Option](../p/put.md) - Total [Premium](../p/premium.md) Paid.

Therefore, for the [trade](../t/trade.md) to be profitable at expiration, the stock price must move beyond either the upper or lower breakeven points.

## Advantages

1. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Maximum loss is limited to the [premium](../p/premium.md) paid, making [risk](../r/risk.md) more manageable.
2. **Potential for Unlimited [Profit](../p/profit.md)**: The strategy offers unlimited [profit](../p/profit.md) potential on the [upside](../u/upside.md) (if the price rises significantly) and substantial [profit](../p/profit.md) potential on the downside (if the price drops significantly).
3. **No Need to Predict Direction**: Traders benefit from significant price movements in either direction.

## Disadvantages

1. **Cost**: Buying two [options](../o/options.md) requires a higher initial investment ([premium](../p/premium.md) cost) compared to a single [options](../o/options.md) [trade](../t/trade.md), which can be substantial depending on the [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and expiration period.
2. **[Theta](../t/theta.md) Decay**: [Time decay](../t/time_decay.md) works against the [trader](../t/trader.md), as the [value](../v/value.md) of both [options](../o/options.md) diminishes as time progresses towards expiry, especially if the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price does not move significantly.
3. **Mismanagement of Expiration**: If not managed properly, both [options](../o/options.md) could expire worthless, leading to a total loss of the [premium](../p/premium.md) paid.

## Practical Application in Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) can significantly enhance the effectiveness of the Long [Strangle](../s/strangle.md) strategy by using algorithms to determine optimal entry and exit points, manage [risk](../r/risk.md), and calibrate the timing of trades. Here are several ways algotrading enhances the Long [Strangle](../s/strangle.md) strategy:

1. **Automated Executions**: Algorithms can automatically execute trades when specific [market](../m/market.md) conditions are met, bypassing human latency and ensuring timely [order](../o/order.md) placement.
2. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Algotrading systems can automate [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) protocols, ensuring that the [trader](../t/trader.md) does not exceed preset [risk](../r/risk.md) thresholds. This includes setting stop-loss and take-[profit](../p/profit.md) levels automatically.
3. **[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md)**: Traders can backtest the Long [Strangle](../s/strangle.md) strategy against historical data to fine-tune the criteria that trigger trades, thereby improving the chances of a successful strategy.
4. **[Market](../m/market.md) Scanning**: Algorithms can continuously scan [multiple](../m/multiple.md) assets and markets to identify the most promising opportunities for deploying a Long [Strangle](../s/strangle.md) based on real-time data.

## Real-World Applications

### Retail Traders
Retail traders often use the Long [Strangle](../s/strangle.md) strategy as a cost-effective way to bet on [volatility](../v/volatility.md). With the rise of online trading platforms like [Robinhood](https://www.robinhood.com/) and [E*TRADE](https://us.etrade.com/), retail traders have easy access to option trading and can implement this strategy without high [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md).

### Institutional Traders
Institutional traders employ more sophisticated versions of the Long [Strangle](../s/strangle.md) strategy, often enhanced with [proprietary algorithms](../p/proprietary_algorithms.md) developed [in-house](../i/in-house.md) or outsourced from specialized firms like [Kensho](https://www.kensho.com/) or [QuantConnect](https://www.quantconnect.com/). These systems are designed to exploit tiny inefficiencies in the [market](../m/market.md) and [leverage](../l/leverage.md) sizable [capital](../c/capital.md) to capture substantial profits.

### Hedge Funds
[Hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds like [Two Sigma](https://www.twosigma.com/) and [Renaissance Technologies](https://www.rentec.com/) are known for using complex algorithmic strategies, including Long Strangles. By effectively managing [risk](../r/risk.md) and leveraging high-frequency trading techniques, these organizations achieve high returns.

## Conclusion

The Long [Strangle](../s/strangle.md) strategy is a powerful tool for traders looking to benefit from significant price fluctuations in an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). While it does come with the inherent risks of [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) and higher initial cost, the potential for substantial [profit](../p/profit.md) in highly volatile markets makes it an attractive strategy for both retail and institutional traders. When combined with [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), the Long [Strangle](../s/strangle.md) strategy can be refined and optimized to achieve consistent and [lucrative](../l/lucrative.md) outcomes.

By leveraging technology and algorithms, traders can minimize human error, optimize [trade](../t/trade.md) [execution](../e/execution.md), and implement advanced [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices, enhancing the overall efficacy of the Long [Strangle](../s/strangle.md) strategy in various [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

# Long Strangle

In the realm of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), a "Long Strangle" is a versatile options strategy employed by traders to capitalize on significant price movements in an underlying asset, without the need to predict the direction of the movement. This strategy involves purchasing both a call option and a put option with different strike prices, but with the same expiration date. The essential goal of the Long Strangle strategy is to profit from volatility rather than the price direction of the underlying asset.

## How Long Strangle Works

To create a Long Strangle, a trader buys one out-of-the-money (OTM) call option and one out-of-the-money put option. These options contracts are about the same underlying asset and have the same expiration date but different strike prices. Here's a breakdown of how each component works:

1. **Call Option**: A call option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying asset at the strike price before the option expires. In a Long Strangle, the strike price of the call option is higher than the current trading price of the underlying asset.

2. **Put Option**: A put option provides the holder with the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying asset at the strike price before expiration. In a Long Strangle, the strike price of the put option is lower than the current trading price of the underlying asset.

### Example

Assume a trader is looking at a stock currently trading at $100. To implement a Long Strangle, the trader could:

- Purchase a call option with a strike price of $110.
- Purchase a put option with a strike price of $90.

Both options have the same expiration date. The premium paid for these options represents the trader's total investment in the Long Strangle strategy.

## Payoff Structure

The payoff structure of a Long Strangle is distinctive and directly linked to the volatility of the underlying asset:

- **If the price increases** significantly above the call option's strike price, the trader can exercise the call option to buy the asset at the lower strike price, then sell it at the current market price, capitalizing on the difference.
- **If the price decreases** significantly below the put option's strike price, the trader can exercise the put option to sell the asset at the higher strike price, then repurchase it at the current market price, again profiting from the discrepancy.
- **If the price remains stable** and does not move significantly, both options expire worthless, leading to a loss limited to the total premium paid for buying the options.

### Breakeven Points

1. **Upper Breakeven Point**: Strike Price of Call Option + Total Premium Paid.
2. **Lower Breakeven Point**: Strike Price of Put Option - Total Premium Paid.

Therefore, for the trade to be profitable at expiration, the stock price must move beyond either the upper or lower breakeven points.

## Advantages

1. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Maximum loss is limited to the premium paid, making risk more manageable.
2. **Potential for Unlimited Profit**: The strategy offers unlimited profit potential on the upside (if the price rises significantly) and substantial profit potential on the downside (if the price drops significantly).
3. **No Need to Predict Direction**: Traders benefit from significant price movements in either direction.

## Disadvantages

1. **Cost**: Buying two options requires a higher initial investment (premium cost) compared to a single options trade, which can be substantial depending on the volatility and expiration period.
2. **Theta Decay**: Time decay works against the trader, as the value of both options diminishes as time progresses towards expiry, especially if the underlying asset's price does not move significantly.
3. **Mismanagement of Expiration**: If not managed properly, both options could expire worthless, leading to a total loss of the premium paid.

## Practical Application in Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) can significantly enhance the effectiveness of the Long Strangle strategy by using algorithms to determine optimal entry and exit points, manage risk, and calibrate the timing of trades. Here are several ways algotrading enhances the Long Strangle strategy:

1. **Automated Executions**: Algorithms can automatically execute trades when specific market conditions are met, bypassing human latency and ensuring timely order placement.
2. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Algotrading systems can automate [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) protocols, ensuring that the trader does not exceed preset risk thresholds. This includes setting stop-loss and take-profit levels automatically.
3. **[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md)**: Traders can backtest the Long Strangle strategy against historical data to fine-tune the criteria that trigger trades, thereby improving the chances of a successful strategy.
4. **Market Scanning**: Algorithms can continuously scan multiple assets and markets to identify the most promising opportunities for deploying a Long Strangle based on real-time data.

## Real-World Applications

### Retail Traders
Retail traders often use the Long Strangle strategy as a cost-effective way to bet on volatility. With the rise of online trading platforms like [Robinhood](https://www.robinhood.com/) and [E*TRADE](https://us.etrade.com/), retail traders have easy access to option trading and can implement this strategy without high transaction costs.

### Institutional Traders
Institutional traders employ more sophisticated versions of the Long Strangle strategy, often enhanced with [proprietary algorithms](../p/proprietary_algorithms.md) developed in-house or outsourced from specialized firms like [Kensho](https://www.kensho.com/) or [QuantConnect](https://www.quantconnect.com/). These systems are designed to exploit tiny inefficiencies in the market and leverage sizable capital to capture substantial profits.

### Hedge Funds
Hedge funds like [Two Sigma](https://www.twosigma.com/) and [Renaissance Technologies](https://www.rentec.com/) are known for using complex algorithmic strategies, including Long Strangles. By effectively managing risk and leveraging high-frequency trading techniques, these organizations achieve high returns.

## Conclusion

The Long Strangle strategy is a powerful tool for traders looking to benefit from significant price fluctuations in an underlying asset. While it does come with the inherent risks of time decay and higher initial cost, the potential for substantial profit in highly volatile markets makes it an attractive strategy for both retail and institutional traders. When combined with [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), the Long Strangle strategy can be refined and optimized to achieve consistent and lucrative outcomes.

By leveraging technology and algorithms, traders can minimize human error, optimize trade execution, and implement advanced [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices, enhancing the overall efficacy of the Long Strangle strategy in various market conditions.

# Vertical Equity

Vertical [equity](../e/equity.md) is a principle in economic policy and [taxation](../t/taxation.md) that holds that individuals who have a greater ability to pay [taxes](../t/taxes.md) should contribute more to the tax system. This principle is designed to ensure that wealthier individuals and entities shoulder a higher tax burden, thereby fostering a fairer [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of resources and promoting social [equity](../e/equity.md). The concept is central to progressive [taxation](../t/taxation.md) systems and plays a crucial role in discussions about [economic justice](../e/economic_justice.md), social policy, and government [revenue](../r/revenue.md) generation.

## Conceptual Framework

Vertical [equity](../e/equity.md) is based on the idea that people's contributions to [financing](../f/financing.md) public goods and services should correspond to their ability to pay. This principle is opposed to [horizontal equity](../h/horizontal_equity.md), which argues that individuals with similar financial capabilities should be treated equally by the tax system. Together, both forms of [equity](../e/equity.md) aim to create a tax system that is not only fair but also efficient and effective in meeting the societal needs.

### Ability to Pay Principle

The "ability to pay" principle underpins vertical [equity](../e/equity.md). It suggests that [taxes](../t/taxes.md) should be levied based on an individual's or entity's economic capacity. In this context, economic capacity is often measured through [income](../i/income.md), [wealth](../w/wealth.md), or consumption levels. Vertical [equity](../e/equity.md) acknowledges that those with higher incomes or greater [wealth](../w/wealth.md) have a higher capacity to contribute to state revenues without compromising their [standard of living](../s/standard_of_living.md).

### Progressive Taxation

Progressive [taxation](../t/taxation.md) is a common application of vertical [equity](../e/equity.md). In a [progressive tax](../p/progressive_tax.md) system, the [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md) increases as [income](../i/income.md) or [wealth](../w/wealth.md) increases. This means that higher-[income](../i/income.md) earners pay a larger percentage of their [earnings](../e/earnings.md) in [taxes](../t/taxes.md) compared to lower-[income](../i/income.md) earners. The rationale is to distribute the tax burden more equitably and to reduce economic inequality by redistributing [wealth](../w/wealth.md).

For example, in the United States, the [federal income](../f/federal_income.md) tax system is designed to be progressive, with [tax brackets](../t/tax_brackets.md) that escalate with [income](../i/income.md) levels. 

## Applications of Vertical Equity

Vertical [equity](../e/equity.md) is not confined to [income](../i/income.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) alone. It can be applied in various forms of [taxation](../t/taxation.md) and public policy:

1. **[Wealth](../w/wealth.md) [Taxes](../t/taxes.md):** These [taxes](../t/taxes.md) are levied on the [value](../v/value.md) of owned assets, such as property, [stocks](../s/stock.md), and bonds. [Wealth](../w/wealth.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) aim to target the wealthiest individuals who may have lower [income](../i/income.md) but significant [asset](../a/asset.md) [holdings](../h/holdings.md).
  
2. **[Estate](../e/estate.md) [Taxes](../t/taxes.md):** These are [taxes](../t/taxes.md) on the net [value](../v/value.md) of an [estate](../e/estate.md) of a deceased person before [distribution](../d/distribution.md) to the heirs. [Estate](../e/estate.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) often target large inheritances to prevent accumulation and perpetuation of [wealth](../w/wealth.md) inequality across generations.

3. **Consumption [Taxes](../t/taxes.md):** Though often considered regressive, consumption [taxes](../t/taxes.md) can be tailored to fit principles of vertical [equity](../e/equity.md) through luxury [taxes](../t/taxes.md) on non-essential, high-end goods.

4. **[Capital](../c/capital.md) Gains [Taxes](../t/taxes.md):** Higher rates of tax on realized gains from investments also embody principles of vertical [equity](../e/equity.md) by taxing [investment income](../i/investment_income.md), which generally accrues to wealthier individuals.

## Evaluating Vertical Equity

Assessing vertical [equity](../e/equity.md) in a tax system involves examining both the fairness and the [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) of the tax policies:

1. **Fairness:** A vertically equitable tax system is perceived as fair if it aligns tax [obligations](../o/obligation.md) with an individual's ability to pay. This approach helps to mitigate [income](../i/income.md) and [wealth](../w/wealth.md) inequality, ensuring that the affluent contribute proportionally more.

2. **[Efficiency](../e/efficiency.md):** [Economic efficiency](../e/economic_efficiency.md) involves the optimal allocation of resources where they are most productive. An efficient tax system does not distort economic behavior excessively. Critics of high progressive [taxes](../t/taxes.md) argue that they can reduce incentives to work or invest, thereby impacting [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md).

## Challenges and Criticisms

While vertical [equity](../e/equity.md) aims to create a fairer tax system, it faces several challenges and criticisms:

1. **Economic Behavior Impact:** High progressive [taxes](../t/taxes.md) might impact labor [supply](../s/supply.md), savings, and investment behaviors, potentially hindering [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md).

2. **[Tax Evasion](../t/tax_evasion.md) and Avoidance:** Wealthier individuals and corporations often have more resources and incentives to engage in [tax evasion](../t/tax_evasion.md) and avoidance, thereby undermining the [equity](../e/equity.md) and effectiveness of the tax system.

3. **Administrative Complexity:** Implementing [progressive tax](../p/progressive_tax.md) rates can be complex and costly. Monitoring and ensuring compliance requires substantial administrative resources.

4. **Perceptions of [Equity](../e/equity.md):** What constitutes an "equitable" tax system is subjective and can vary across different societies and political ideologies.

## Policy Examples

Several countries have applied the principles of vertical [equity](../e/equity.md) in their tax policies. Here are a few examples:

1. **United States:** The U.S. has a [federal income](../f/federal_income.md) tax system with [progressive tax](../p/progressive_tax.md) brackets. The highest [income](../i/income.md) earners fall into the highest tax bracket, which has seen various changes over the years. [Estate](../e/estate.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) and [capital](../c/capital.md) gains [taxes](../t/taxes.md) also reflect principles of vertical [equity](../e/equity.md).

2. **Sweden:** Known for its high [taxation](../t/taxation.md) rates, Sweden implements progressive [income](../i/income.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) along with substantial [wealth](../w/wealth.md) and inheritance [taxes](../t/taxes.md). These policies support a comprehensive [welfare state](../w/welfare_state.md) aimed at reducing inequality.

3. **United Kingdom:** The UK operates under a progressive [income tax](../i/income_tax.md) regime, with higher rates for higher earners. Additionally, the [inheritance tax](../i/inheritance_tax.md) aims to capture [wealth](../w/wealth.md) passed across generations.

## FinTech and Vertical Equity

In the evolving financial landscape, FinTech companies can play a role in advancing vertical [equity](../e/equity.md):

1. **TaxTech Solutions:** FinTech companies are developing innovative TaxTech solutions that facilitate compliance and reduce evasion through technology. These solutions can ensure that wealthier individuals and corporations pay their fair share.

2. **[Data Analytics](../d/data_analytics.md):** Advanced [data analytics](../d/data_analytics.md) and AI can help tax authorities identify potential loopholes and high-[risk](../r/risk.md) areas for [tax evasion](../t/tax_evasion.md). Enhanced [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and data sharing can lead to a more equitable tax system.

3. **Investment Platforms:** FinTech platforms [offering](../o/offering.md) fractional [shares](../s/shares.md) and robo-advisors can democratize access to [wealth](../w/wealth.md)-building tools, indirectly promoting economic [equity](../e/equity.md).

## Conclusion

Vertical [equity](../e/equity.md) remains a vital principle in designing fair [taxation](../t/taxation.md) and economic policies. By requiring higher contributions from those with greater financial means, vertical [equity](../e/equity.md) seeks to balance the scales of [economic justice](../e/economic_justice.md) and ensure that the tax system supports societal well-being and reduces disparities. Despite the challenges and criticisms, the continuous evolution of tax policies and technological advancements [offer](../o/offer.md) pathways to achieving greater vertical [equity](../e/equity.md) in modern economies.

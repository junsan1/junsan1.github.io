# Vice Fund

The Vice [Fund](../f/fund.md) (VICEX) is a [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md) that invests in companies primarily involved in industries considered to be morally or socially controversial. These sectors typically include alcohol, tobacco, gambling, defense, and aerospace. By focusing on these so-called "sin [stocks](../s/stock.md)," the Vice [Fund](../f/fund.md) aims to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on the often resilient [demand](../d/demand.md) in these industries, irrespective of broader [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md).

## Overview and History

The Vice [Fund](../f/fund.md) was created to take advantage of the [robust](../r/robust.md) [earnings](../e/earnings.md) potential associated with sectors traditionally seen as [recession](../r/recession.md)-resistant. It was launched by Mutual Advisors, LLC, a company that specializes in identifying unique investment opportunities.

The [fund](../f/fund.md)'s [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) is predicated on the idea that companies in vice-related industries are less affected by economic downturns. For example, people may continue to smoke, drink, and gamble even during tough economic times. Defense spending and aerospace industries also typically maintain steady government contracts irrespective of [economic cycles](../e/economic_cycles.md).

## Investment Strategy

### Sector Focus

1. **Alcohol**: Companies involved in the production, [distribution](../d/distribution.md), and retailing of alcoholic beverages.
2. **Tobacco**: Producers and distributors of cigarettes, cigars, and other tobacco products.
3. **Gambling**: Casinos, online gambling sites, and operators of betting facilities.
4. **Defense and Aerospace**: Companies that manufacture weapons, military technology, and aerospace components.

### Stock Selection Criteria

[Stocks](../s/stock.md) are chosen based on [financial health](../f/financial_health.md), strong management teams, and potential for long-term growth. The [fund](../f/fund.md)'s managers conduct rigorous [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md) and stay updated on [industry](../i/industry.md) trends to identify the best opportunities.

### Ethical Considerations

The [fund](../f/fund.md) explicitly disregards [ethical investing](../e/ethical_investing.md) constraints. Instead, it prioritizes financial returns, assuming that these industries' controversial nature ironically shields them from certain [market](../m/market.md) forces, providing stable and potentially high returns.

## Performance Metrics

The Vice [Fund](../f/fund.md)'s [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md) are in line with other [equity](../e/equity.md) funds but often showcase less [volatility](../v/volatility.md). Its historical performance is evaluated via conventional metrics including:

- **Net [Asset](../a/asset.md) [Value](../v/value.md) (NAV)**: Daily [value](../v/value.md) of a unit of the [fund](../f/fund.md) based on the closing prices of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md).
- **[Expense Ratio](../e/expense_ratio.md)**: Costs associated with managing the [fund](../f/fund.md). As of the last update, the Vice [Fund](../f/fund.md) had an [expense ratio](../e/expense_ratio.md) of approximately 2.0%.
- **[Yield](../y/yield.md)**: This metric is particularly relevant to investors focusing on [income](../i/income.md) generation.
  
### Benchmarks

The [fund](../f/fund.md) uses various benchmarks to evaluate its performance, generally pitting itself against indices like the S&P 500 for broader [market](../m/market.md) comparisons.

## Regulatory Environment

The companies in the Vice [Fund](../f/fund.md) are subject to stringent regulatory environments due to the nature of their activities. Here's a concise view of the key regulatory frameworks:

### Alcohol

- **Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and [Trade](../t/trade.md) Bureau (TTB)**: Governs the production, [distribution](../d/distribution.md), and importation of alcohol in the USA.
- **State Regulations**: Different states have varying rules governing alcohol sales and [distribution](../d/distribution.md).

### Tobacco

- **Food and Drug Administration (FDA)**: Oversees the [marketing](../m/marketing.md), production, and labeling of tobacco products.
- **Public Health Laws**: Restrictions on advertising, consumption age, and smoking zones.

### Gambling

- **State Gambling Commissions**: Each state has its regulatory authority that oversees gambling licenses, audits, and enforcement of rules.
- **Federal Legislation**: Laws like the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) impact online gambling companies.

### Defense and Aerospace

- **Defense Contracts**: Governed by the Department of Defense and other governmental bodies, ensuring compliance with strict ethical, performance, and national [security](../s/security.md) standards.
- **[Export](../e/export.md) Controls**: International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and [Export](../e/export.md) Administration Regulations (EAR) govern the [export](../e/export.md) of defense and aerospace technologies.

## Risks Involved

### Market Risk

Like any [equity fund](../e/equity_fund.md), the Vice [Fund](../f/fund.md) is subject to [market](../m/market.md) risks. Prices of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) can fluctuate due to [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md), economic changes, and global events.

### Regulatory Risk

Stringent regulations can affect [business](../b/business.md) operations, leading to potential financial instability or significant costs. Changes in legislation can adversely impact these companies' [revenue](../r/revenue.md) streams.

### Social Stigma

Public perception can sometimes exert pressure on companies in these sectors, potentially harming their stock prices. For instance, increasing anti-smoking campaigns can reduce tobacco sales over time.

### Ethical Risks

Investors must consider the ethical implications of [investing](../i/investing.md) in companies that contribute to contentious areas like gambling addiction, alcohol dependence, or defense [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md).

## Advantages of the Vice Fund

The core idea behind the Vice [Fund](../f/fund.md) is [investing](../i/investing.md) in industries that tend to perform well regardless of [economic cycles](../e/economic_cycles.md).

### Diversification

### Potential for Higher Returns

Given the high [demand](../d/demand.md) and established [customer](../c/customer.md) bases for these products and services, there's a potential for [lucrative](../l/lucrative.md) returns.

## Disadvantages of the Vice Fund

### Ethical Concerns

### Regulatory Pressures

# Vice Fund

The Vice Fund (VICEX) is a mutual fund that invests in companies primarily involved in industries considered to be morally or socially controversial. These sectors typically include alcohol, tobacco, gambling, defense, and aerospace. By focusing on these so-called "sin stocks," the Vice Fund aims to capitalize on the often resilient demand in these industries, irrespective of broader economic conditions.

## Overview and History

The Vice Fund was created to take advantage of the robust earnings potential associated with sectors traditionally seen as recession-resistant. It was launched by Mutual Advisors, LLC, a company that specializes in identifying unique investment opportunities.

The fund's investment strategy is predicated on the idea that companies in vice-related industries are less affected by economic downturns. For example, people may continue to smoke, drink, and gamble even during tough economic times. Defense spending and aerospace industries also typically maintain steady government contracts irrespective of economic cycles.

## Investment Strategy

### Sector Focus

1. **Alcohol**: Companies involved in the production, distribution, and retailing of alcoholic beverages.
2. **Tobacco**: Producers and distributors of cigarettes, cigars, and other tobacco products.
3. **Gambling**: Casinos, online gambling sites, and operators of betting facilities.
4. **Defense and Aerospace**: Companies that manufacture weapons, military technology, and aerospace components.

### Stock Selection Criteria

Stocks are chosen based on financial health, strong management teams, and potential for long-term growth. The fund's managers conduct rigorous financial analysis and stay updated on industry trends to identify the best opportunities.

### Ethical Considerations

The fund explicitly disregards ethical investing constraints. Instead, it prioritizes financial returns, assuming that these industries' controversial nature ironically shields them from certain market forces, providing stable and potentially high returns.

## Performance Metrics

The Vice Fund's performance metrics are in line with other equity funds but often showcase less volatility. Its historical performance is evaluated via conventional metrics including:

- **Net Asset Value (NAV)**: Daily value of a unit of the fund based on the closing prices of the underlying stocks.
- **Expense Ratio**: Costs associated with managing the fund. As of the last update, the Vice Fund had an expense ratio of approximately 2.0%.
- **Yield**: This metric is particularly relevant to investors focusing on income generation.
  
### Benchmarks

The fund uses various benchmarks to evaluate its performance, generally pitting itself against indices like the S&P 500 for broader market comparisons.

## Regulatory Environment

The companies in the Vice Fund are subject to stringent regulatory environments due to the nature of their activities. Here's a concise view of the key regulatory frameworks:

### Alcohol

- **State Regulations**: Different states have varying rules governing alcohol sales and distribution.

### Tobacco

- **Food and Drug Administration (FDA)**: Oversees the marketing, production, and labeling of tobacco products.
- **Public Health Laws**: Restrictions on advertising, consumption age, and smoking zones.

### Gambling

- **State Gambling Commissions**: Each state has its regulatory authority that oversees gambling licenses, audits, and enforcement of rules.
- **Federal Legislation**: Laws like the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) impact online gambling companies.

### Defense and Aerospace

- **Defense Contracts**: Governed by the Department of Defense and other governmental bodies, ensuring compliance with strict ethical, performance, and national security standards.
- **Export Controls**: International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and Export Administration Regulations (EAR) govern the export of defense and aerospace technologies.

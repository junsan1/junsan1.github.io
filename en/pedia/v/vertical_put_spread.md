# Vertical Put Spread

## Introduction
A Vertical Put Spread is a popular [options](../o/options.md) [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) involving the simultaneous buying and selling of [put options](../p/put_options.md) on the same [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) with the same [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md) but at different strike prices. This strategy is primarily utilized by traders to express a bearish outlook on the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) with limited [risk](../r/risk.md) and reward profiles.

## Understanding the Mechanics
A Vertical Put Spread typically involves two key actions:

1. **Buying a [Put Option](../p/put.md)**: This gives the [trader](../t/trader.md) the right to sell the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md). It is the primary position and dictates the direction of the [trade](../t/trade.md) (bearish).

2. **Selling a [Put Option](../p/put.md)**: This is done at a lower [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) than the bought put. This action helps to [offset](../o/offset.md) some of the cost of the bought put and defines the maximum potential loss and [gain](../g/gain.md) for the [trade](../t/trade.md).

The result is a spread because the [trader](../t/trader.md) is dealing with two different strike prices.

## Key Terminology
- **[Strike Price](../s/strike_price.md)**: The price at which the [put options](../p/put_options.md) [will](../w/will.md) be executed.
- **[Expiration Date](../e/expiration_date.md)**: The date on which the [options](../o/options.md) [will](../w/will.md) expire.
- **[Debit](../d/debit.md) Spread**: When the cost to enter the spread (the price paid for the bought put minus the price received for the sold put) is an upfront [debit](../d/debit.md).
- **[Credit Spread](../c/credit_spread.md)**: When the strategy is structured to take in net [credit](../c/credit.md), though less common in vertical put [spreads](../s/spreads.md) compared to vertical call [spreads](../s/spreads.md).

## Example of Vertical Put Spread

Consider the following hypothetical case:
- An [investor](../i/investor.md) buys a [put option](../p/put.md) on Stock XYZ with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $100, expiring in 1 month, for a [premium](../p/premium.md) of $5.
- Simultaneously, the [investor](../i/investor.md) sells a [put option](../p/put.md) on Stock XYZ with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $90, expiring in 1 month, for a [premium](../p/premium.md) of $2.

The net cost (or [debit](../d/debit.md)) for this vertical put spread would be (5 - 2) = $3.

### Potential Outcomes

1. **Stock XYZ Falls Below $90**: 
   - The [investor](../i/investor.md)'s [profit](../p/profit.md) [will](../w/will.md) be the difference between the strike prices minus the [net premium](../n/net_premium.md) paid.
   - Maximum [profit](../p/profit.md) = ($100 - $90) - $3 = $7 per share.

2. **Stock XYZ Ends Between $90 and $100**: 
   - The [long put](../l/long_put.md) expires with [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md), and the [short put](../s/short_put.md) expires worthless.
   - The [investor](../i/investor.md)'s loss is mitigated partially by the [value](../v/value.md) of the long [put option](../p/put.md).

3. **Stock XYZ Ends Above $100**:
   - Both [put options](../p/put_options.md) expire worthless, and the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s maximum loss is the [net premium](../n/net_premium.md) paid.
   - Maximum loss = $3.

## Strategy Profile
### Risk Profile
Vertical Put [Spreads](../s/spreads.md) entail limited [risk](../r/risk.md), capped at the [net premium](../n/net_premium.md) paid. This limited loss potential makes it a relatively safer strategy compared to outright buying of puts for bearish bets.

### Reward Profile
The potential reward is also capped and is calculated as the difference between the strike prices, less the [net premium](../n/net_premium.md) paid. This is because the [value](../v/value.md) of the spread can only widen to a certain extent.

## Uses of Vertical Put Spread
### Hedging
Investors may use vertical put [spreads](../s/spreads.md) to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) existing long positions in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). If the stock drops, the [gain](../g/gain.md) from the put spread can [offset](../o/offset.md) some or all of the losses in the stock position.

### Speculation
Traders with a moderately bearish outlook may use this strategy to speculate on a decline in the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) with a predetermined [risk](../r/risk.md)-reward profile. It allows for betting on bearish moves without large [capital](../c/capital.md) outlays.

### Income Generation
In some [market](../m/market.md) conditions, vertical put [spreads](../s/spreads.md) can be part of a broader strategy to generate [income](../i/income.md) through [premium](../p/premium.md) collection by utilizing the sell side of the spread.

## Advanced Considerations
### Implied Volatility
Implied [Volatility](../v/volatility.md) (IV) plays a significant role in the pricing of [options](../o/options.md) and hence in the profitability of a vertical put spread. Higher IV generally increases the premiums of the [options](../o/options.md). If a [trader](../t/trader.md) expects a decline in IV, entering a put spread when IV is high could be beneficial.

### Time Decay
[Time decay](../t/time_decay.md) ([Theta](../t/theta.md)) works in favor of the vertical put spread [trader](../t/trader.md) when both [options](../o/options.md) are out-of-the-[money](../m/money.md). However, it can adversely affect the position if the stock moves towards the bought put's [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).

### Selecting Strike Prices
The choice of strike prices for the bought and sold puts can be optimized based on:
- **[Risk Tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md)**: Wider [spreads](../s/spreads.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) higher potential profits but come with higher costs.
- **[Profit](../p/profit.md) Targets**: Narrower [spreads](../s/spreads.md) are cheaper but [offer](../o/offer.md) lower potential profits.
- **[Market](../m/market.md) Outlook**: More bearish outlooks may justify buying puts closer to the current stock price and selling puts at lower strikes.

## Comparison with Other Strategies
### Vertical Call Spread
Similar in structure but used for bullish outlooks. A vertical call spread involves buying and selling call [options](../o/options.md) instead.

### Calendar Spread
Involves buying and selling [options](../o/options.md) with different expiration dates but the same [strike price](../s/strike_price.md). Aimed at capitalizing on [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) differences.

### Iron Condor
A more complex strategy that combines a vertical put spread with a vertical call spread to [profit](../p/profit.md) from low [volatility](../v/volatility.md) markets.

# Vertical Put Spread

## Introduction
A Vertical Put Spread is a popular options trading strategy involving the simultaneous buying and selling of [put options](../p/put_options.md) on the same underlying asset with the same expiration date but at different strike prices. This strategy is primarily utilized by traders to express a bearish outlook on the underlying asset with limited risk and reward profiles.

## Understanding the Mechanics
A Vertical Put Spread typically involves two key actions:

1. **Buying a Put Option**: This gives the trader the right to sell the underlying asset at the strike price. It is the primary position and dictates the direction of the trade (bearish).

2. **Selling a Put Option**: This is done at a lower strike price than the bought put. This action helps to offset some of the cost of the bought put and defines the maximum potential loss and gain for the trade.

The result is a spread because the trader is dealing with two different strike prices.

## Key Terminology
- **Strike Price**: The price at which the [put options](../p/put_options.md) will be executed.
- **Expiration Date**: The date on which the options will expire.
- **Debit Spread**: When the cost to enter the spread (the price paid for the bought put minus the price received for the sold put) is an upfront debit.
- **Credit Spread**: When the strategy is structured to take in net credit, though less common in vertical put spreads compared to vertical call spreads.

## Example of Vertical Put Spread

Consider the following hypothetical case:
- An investor buys a put option on Stock XYZ with a strike price of $100, expiring in 1 month, for a premium of $5.
- Simultaneously, the investor sells a put option on Stock XYZ with a strike price of $90, expiring in 1 month, for a premium of $2.

The net cost (or debit) for this vertical put spread would be (5 - 2) = $3.

### Potential Outcomes

1. **Stock XYZ Falls Below $90**: 
   - The investor's profit will be the difference between the strike prices minus the net premium paid.
   - Maximum profit = ($100 - $90) - $3 = $7 per share.

2. **Stock XYZ Ends Between $90 and $100**: 
   - The long put expires with intrinsic value, and the short put expires worthless.
   - The investor's loss is mitigated partially by the value of the long put option.

3. **Stock XYZ Ends Above $100**:
   - Both [put options](../p/put_options.md) expire worthless, and the investor's maximum loss is the net premium paid.
   - Maximum loss = $3.

## Strategy Profile
### Risk Profile
Vertical Put Spreads entail limited risk, capped at the net premium paid. This limited loss potential makes it a relatively safer strategy compared to outright buying of puts for bearish bets.

### Reward Profile
The potential reward is also capped and is calculated as the difference between the strike prices, less the net premium paid. This is because the value of the spread can only widen to a certain extent.

## Uses of Vertical Put Spread
### Hedging
Investors may use vertical put spreads to hedge existing long positions in the underlying asset. If the stock drops, the gain from the put spread can offset some or all of the losses in the stock position.

### Speculation
Traders with a moderately bearish outlook may use this strategy to speculate on a decline in the price of the underlying asset with a predetermined risk-reward profile. It allows for betting on bearish moves without large capital outlays.

### Income Generation
In some market conditions, vertical put spreads can be part of a broader strategy to generate income through premium collection by utilizing the sell side of the spread.

## Advanced Considerations
### Implied Volatility
Implied Volatility (IV) plays a significant role in the pricing of options and hence in the profitability of a vertical put spread. Higher IV generally increases the premiums of the options. If a trader expects a decline in IV, entering a put spread when IV is high could be beneficial.

### Time Decay
Time decay (Theta) works in favor of the vertical put spread trader when both options are out-of-the-money. However, it can adversely affect the position if the stock moves towards the bought put's strike price.

### Selecting Strike Prices
The choice of strike prices for the bought and sold puts can be optimized based on:
- **Risk Tolerance**: Wider spreads offer higher potential profits but come with higher costs.
- **Profit Targets**: Narrower spreads are cheaper but offer lower potential profits.
- **Market Outlook**: More bearish outlooks may justify buying puts closer to the current stock price and selling puts at lower strikes.

## Comparison with Other Strategies
### Vertical Call Spread
Similar in structure but used for bullish outlooks. A vertical call spread involves buying and selling call options instead.

### Calendar Spread
Involves buying and selling options with different expiration dates but the same strike price. Aimed at capitalizing on time decay differences.

### Iron Condor
A more complex strategy that combines a vertical put spread with a vertical call spread to profit from low volatility markets.

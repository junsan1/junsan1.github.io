# VeChain

VeChain is an enterprise-focused [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) platform that aims to streamline [business](../b/business.md) processes and [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md) management. By leveraging [distributed ledger technology](../d/distributed_ledger_technology.md) (DLT), VeChain enhances [transparency](../t/transparency.md), traceability, and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) across various industries. Initially established in 2015, VeChain has evolved from a [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md)-oriented DLT project to a versatile enterprise-grade application platform. 

## Founding and Background

VeChain was founded by Sunny Lu, a former CIO of Louis Vuitton China, who recognized the potential for [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology to revolutionize [supply](../s/supply.md) chains. The VeChainThor [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md), launched in 2018, is the backbone of the VeChain ecosystem. VeChain’s [parent company](../p/parent_company.md), VeChain Foundation, is headquartered in Singapore, assisting operational development and providing governance for the network.

## Core Technology

### VeChainThor Blockchain

The VeChainThor [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) is a dual-token system comprising VeChain Tokens (VET) and VeThor Tokens (VTHO). VET is primarily used as a [store of value](../s/store_of_value.md) and for staking, while VTHO is used to pay for [transaction fees](../t/transaction_fees.md) and smart contract [execution](../e/execution.md).

#### Proof of Authority (PoA) Consensus

VeChainThor utilizes a Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism, where nodes are pre-approved by the VeChain Foundation. This method provides fast transactions and scalable network management while ensuring sustainability. Unlike Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS), PoA is less energy-intensive, making it an eco-friendly solution.

### Dual-Token System

- **VeChain Token (VET):** VET serves as a medium of [value](../v/value.md) transfer within the VeChain ecosystem. It can be staked to generate VTHO.

- **VeThor Token (VTHO):** VTHO is used to pay for [transaction fees](../t/transaction_fees.md) and [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md). The amount generated depends on the quantity of VET held.

## Applications and Use Cases

VeChain's versatility allows it to cater to a wide [range](../r/range.md) of industries. Some of its notable applications include:

### Supply Chain and Logistics

VeChain is particularly well-suited for [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md) management. It enhances [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and traceability by providing immutable records of product provenance. By scanning a product's QR code, stakeholders can access detailed information about its [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) process, transportation, and ownership history.

### Anti-Counterfeiting

VeChain’s [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) can authenticate products and combat counterfeiting, especially in high-[value](../v/value.md) industries like luxury goods, pharmaceuticals, and electronics. Each product is assigned a unique identifier, affixed as a QR code or NFC tag. [Blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) records ensure that the product is genuine and traceable back to its origin.

### Food Safety

In the food [industry](../i/industry.md), VeChain ensures that food products are sourced, processed, and transported following stringent safety protocols. By recording each step on the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md), consumers can verify the quality and safety of their food, ensuring compliance with health regulations.

### Healthcare

VeChain assists in managing patient records, pharmaceutical [supply](../s/supply.md) chains, and medical devices. [Blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology ensures data integrity, medication authenticity, and secure sharing of health records among authorized entities.

### Carbon Credits

VeChain partners with entities to create digital carbon ecosystems that track and manage carbon credits. This initiative supports [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and environmental sustainability, providing accurate datasets for carbon footprint analysis.

## Partners and Ecosystem

VeChain collaborates with a [range](../r/range.md) of high-profile partners to drive adoption and innovation. Some key partnerships include:

### DNV GL

DNV GL, a global quality [assurance](../a/assurance.md) and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) company, utilizes VeChain’s [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) for various [assurance services](../a/assurance_services.md), including data management and certification processes.

### PwC (PriceWaterhouseCoopers)

PwC is a strategic partner, aiding VeChain in delivering [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) solutions to its extensive network of clients. This collaboration enhances VeChain's credibility and global reach.

### BMW

In partnership with BMW, VeChain is developing the VerifyCar application, a digital passport for vehicles. This application records vehicle data, including maintenance history, mileage, and ownership, providing [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and preventing [fraud](../f/fraud.md).

### Walmart China

Walmart China collaborates with VeChain to enhance food traceability through the Walmart China [Blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) Traceability Platform. This platform ensures product safety and quality by tracking and verifying [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md) data.

## VeChain ToolChain™

VeChain ToolChain™ is an integrated [business](../b/business.md) ecosystem of services and products. Businesses can [leverage](../l/leverage.md) VeChain's [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology without needing deep technical knowledge. ToolChain™ assists in deploying [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md)-based solutions, including [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md) tracking, data auditing, and process management.

## Technical Innovations

### VeChain Sync

VeChain Sync is a secure browser extension used to interact with decentralized applications (dApps) on the VeChainThor [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md). It supports various functionalities, including [asset management](../a/asset_management.md), [transaction](../t/transaction.md) signing, and dApp access.

### VeChainThor Wallet

The VeChainThor Wallet is a mobile application designed for secure management of VET and VTHO. It offers features such as multi-address management, node staking, and X Node transfer services.

### VeChain Explorer

VeChain Explorer is a [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) explorer tool that allows users to search and verify transactions, blocks, and other [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) activities. It provides [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and accessibility within the network.

## Governance and Economic Model

### Steering Committee

VeChain operates with a decentralized governance structure led by a Steering Committee. The committee oversees key decisions, including network upgrades and ecosystem development, ensuring community participation and [transparency](../t/transparency.md).

### Economic Model

VeChain’s economic model is designed to balance token [supply](../s/supply.md) with [demand](../d/demand.md). VET holders generate VTHO over time, and [transaction fees](../t/transaction_fees.md) paid in VTHO are burned, maintaining an [equilibrium](../e/equilibrium.md) between token generation and consumption.

## Future Prospects

VeChain continues to explore and expand its technology to address [emerging industry](../e/emerging_industry.md) challenges. Its focus on [business](../b/business.md) adoption, sustainability, and innovation positions it as a leading platform in the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) space.

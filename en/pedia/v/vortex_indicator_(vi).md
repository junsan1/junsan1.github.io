# Vortex Indicator (VI)

The Vortex [Indicator](../i/indicator.md) (VI) is a [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) tool used in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), particularly in trading, to identify the start of new trends and to confirm the direction of existing trends. It was developed by Etienne Botes and Douglas Siepman and introduced in a 2010 edition of the *[Technical Analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) of [Stocks](../s/stock.md) & Commodities* magazine. This [indicator](../i/indicator.md) is based on the concept of vortex motion, as seen in water and other natural phenomena, applied to price movements in the [market](../m/market.md). The Vortex [Indicator](../i/indicator.md) is made up of two lines: the positive vortex line (VI+) and the negative vortex line (VI-). These lines oscillate around a centerline, helping traders to spot [trend](../t/trend.md) formations and potential [reversal](../r/reversal.md) points.

## Key Components

### Positive Vortex Line (VI+)

The positive vortex line (VI+) captures upward price movement by identifying significant upward price differences over a given period. It is calculated using the current high and the previous low prices. When VI+ crosses above VI-, it signals a potential bullish [trend](../t/trend.md).

### Negative Vortex Line (VI-)

The negative vortex line (VI-) measures downward price movement, capturing significant downward price differences over a specified period. This is calculated using the current low and the previous high prices. When VI- crosses above VI+, it indicates a potential bearish [trend](../t/trend.md).

## Calculation of the Vortex Indicator

The Vortex [Indicator](../i/indicator.md) is calculated using the following steps:

1. **Compute the True [Range](../r/range.md) (TR):**
   The True [Range](../r/range.md) is the greatest of the following:

   - Current high minus the current low
   - Absolute [value](../v/value.md) of the current high minus the previous close
   - Absolute [value](../v/value.md) of the current low minus the previous close

   \[
   TR_t = \max [(High_t - Low_t), |High_t - Close_{t-1}|, |Low_t - Close_{t-1}|]
   \]

2. **Compute Upward Movement (VM+):**
   The upward movement for the period is the absolute [value](../v/value.md) of the current high minus the previous low.

   \[
   VM^+_t = |High_t - Low_{t-1}|
   \]

3. **Compute Downward Movement (VM-):**
   The downward movement for the period is the absolute [value](../v/value.md) of the current low minus the previous high.

   \[
   VM^-_t = |Low_t - High_{t-1}|
   \]

4. **Sum these values over a specific period (n):**
   Sum the True [Range](../r/range.md), the Upward Movement, and the Downward Movement over 'n' periods.

   \[
   TR_n = \sum_{i=1}^n TR_i
   \]
   \[
   VM^+_n = \sum_{i=1}^n VM^+_i
   \]
   \[
   VM^-_n = \sum_{i=1}^n VM^-_i
   \]

5. **Calculate VI+ and VI-:**
   Divide the summed values of VM+ and VM- by the sum of the True [Range](../r/range.md) over the chosen period.

   \[
   VI^+_n = \frac{VM^+_n}{TR_n}
   \]
   \[
   VI^-_n = \frac{VM^-_n}{TR_n}
   \]

## Interpretation and Use in Trading

### Bullish and Bearish Signals

- **Bullish Signal:** When VI+ crosses above VI-, it indicates that upward price movement is stronger than downward movement, signaling a potential bullish [trend](../t/trend.md).
- **Bearish Signal:** When VI- crosses above VI+, it implies that downward price movement is stronger, suggesting a potential bearish [trend](../t/trend.md).

### Trend Confirmation

The Vortex [Indicator](../i/indicator.md) is particularly useful in confirming the direction of a [trend](../t/trend.md). For instance, if VI+ continues rising above VI-, it reaffirms the strength of the bullish [trend](../t/trend.md). Conversely, if VI- stays above VI+, it validates the strength of the bearish [trend](../t/trend.md).

### Divergence Analysis

Traders can also use the Vortex [Indicator](../i/indicator.md) to identify [divergence](../d/divergence.md). [Divergence](../d/divergence.md) occurs when the price moves in one direction and the [indicator](../i/indicator.md) moves in the opposite direction, signaling a potential [trend reversal](../t/trend_reversal.md). For example:
- **[Bullish Divergence](../b/bullish_divergence.md):** If the price is making lower lows while VI+ is making higher lows.
- **[Bearish Divergence](../b/bearish_divergence.md):** If the price is making higher highs while VI- is making lower highs.

## Limitations

Despite its effectiveness, the Vortex [Indicator](../i/indicator.md) has some limitations:

- **Lag:** The Vortex [Indicator](../i/indicator.md), like many [trend](../t/trend.md)-following indicators, can lag due to its reliance on past price data.
- **[False Signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md):** In sideways or choppy markets, the Vortex [Indicator](../i/indicator.md) may generate [false signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md) as VI+ and VI- frequently cross each other without establishing a clear [trend](../t/trend.md).
- **Parameter Sensitivity:** The choice of period (n) can significantly impact the [indicator](../i/indicator.md)’s performance. Shorter periods make the [indicator](../i/indicator.md) more sensitive to price changes but may increase [false signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md), while longer periods smooth out price movements but reduce sensitivity.

## Practical Application

### Stock Markets

The Vortex [Indicator](../i/indicator.md) is frequently used in stock trading to identify potential entry and exit points. For example, a [trader](../t/trader.md) might enter a long position when VI+ crosses above VI- and exit when VI- crosses above VI+.

### Forex and Commodities

In Forex and [commodity](../c/commodity.md) markets, the Vortex [Indicator](../i/indicator.md) can be particularly effective in identifying [trend](../t/trend.md) reversals and confirming the strength of ongoing trends. It's often used in conjunction with other [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicator.md) to filter out [false signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md) and improve the accuracy of trading decisions.

### Algorithmic Trading

The Vortex [Indicator](../i/indicator.md) can be integrated into [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) systems due to its clear formula and straightforward logic. Algorithms can be programmed to automatically execute trades based on the crossing points of VI+ and VI-, thereby eliminating emotional decision-making from trading.

### Customization and Integration

Traders can customize the Vortex [Indicator](../i/indicator.md) by adjusting the period (n) for different trading styles and [market](../m/market.md) conditions. It is also compatible with numerous trading platforms and software, including MetaTrader, [TradingView](../t/tradingview.md), and others, allowing for seamless integration into various [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

## Comparing Vortex Indicator with Other Indicators

### Vortex Indicator vs. Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)

Both VI and MACD are used to identify trends and potential reversals, but they do so in different ways:
- **VI** focuses on up and down movements relative to each other.
- **MACD** considers the relationship between two moving averages of prices.

### Vortex Indicator vs. Relative Strength Index (RSI)

While RSI measures the speed and change of price movements to identify [overbought](../o/overbought.md)/[oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions, VI simply tracks potential [trend](../t/trend.md) direction and strength without delving into [market](../m/market.md) conditions of extremes.

### Vortex Indicator vs. ADX (Average Directional Index)

The ADX measures [trend](../t/trend.md) strength without indicating direction, while the VI provides both [trend](../t/trend.md) direction and strength. Traders may use the VI to determine [trend](../t/trend.md) direction and the ADX to confirm [trend](../t/trend.md) strength.

## Conclusion

The Vortex [Indicator](../i/indicator.md) (VI) is a valuable tool in a [trader](../t/trader.md)’s arsenal for identifying and confirming trends in various [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). Despite its limitations, when used in conjunction with other indicators and analysis techniques, it can significantly enhance [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) by providing clear and actionable signals. A deep understanding of this [indicator](../i/indicator.md)'s mechanics and careful period selection can help traders optimize its use and improve their trading outcomes.

# Value Investing

[Value](../v/value.md) [investing](../i/investing.md) is a systematic approach to [investing](../i/investing.md) that involves buying securities that appear underpriced by some form of [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md). It is a strategy used by investors to seek out and purchase [stocks](../s/stock.md) that are believed to be trading for less than their intrinsic or [book value](../b/book_value.md). This strategy hinges on the idea that the [market](../m/market.md), while often efficient, can misprice assets temporarily, providing opportunities for investors to acquire good companies at bargain prices.

## Key Principles of Value Investing

### 1. Intrinsic Value
[Intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) is a core tenet of [value](../v/value.md) [investing](../i/investing.md). It refers to the actual worth of a company's stock, derived through quantitative measures such as [earnings](../e/earnings.md), dividends, [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md), and other fundamental processes. [Intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) can be distinguished from [market value](../m/market_value.md), which can be influenced by [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) and [speculation](../s/speculation.md).

### 2. Margin of Safety
The [margin of safety](../m/margin_of_safety.md) principle aims to mitigate [risk](../r/risk.md) by ensuring that the price paid for a [security](../s/security.md) is significantly below its [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md). This means that even if the company does not perform as well as expected, the [investor](../i/investor.md) has a lower likelihood of losing [money](../m/money.md).

### 3. Long-Term Investment Horizon
[Value](../v/value.md) investors typically focus on the long-term potential of their investments. This approach involves holding securities for several years to allow their [market](../m/market.md) prices to adjust to their intrinsic values. It counters the short-term [speculation](../s/speculation.md) that often drives stock price [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

### 4. Fundamental Analysis
[Fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md) is the examination of a company's [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md), including its [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md), [income statement](../i/income_statement.md), and [cash flow statement](../c/cash_flow_statement.md). [Value](../v/value.md) investors analyze these documents to gauge the company's [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and calculate its [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md).

### 5. Contrarian Thinking
[Value](../v/value.md) [investing](../i/investing.md) often involves a contrarian approach, where investors buy [stocks](../s/stock.md) that are currently unpopular or [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) instead of following prevailing [market](../m/market.md) trends. This approach requires a high level of discipline and independence of thought.

## Important Metrics in Value Investing

### 1. Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio
The P/E ratio is a widely used metric to determine if a stock is [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md). It is calculated by dividing the current [market price](../m/market_price.md) of a stock by its [earnings](../e/earnings.md) per share (EPS). A low P/E ratio may suggest that the stock is [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md).

### 2. Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio
The P/B ratio compares a company's [market price](../m/market_price.md) to its [book value](../b/book_value.md). It is calculated by dividing the stock's [market price](../m/market_price.md) by its [book value](../b/book_value.md) per share. A lower P/B ratio indicates that the stock might be [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md).

### 3. Dividend Yield
[Dividend yield](../d/dividend_yield.md) is another significant metric for [value](../v/value.md) investors. It measures how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative to its stock price. A high [dividend yield](../d/dividend_yield.md) can be an [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of an [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) stock.

### 4. Debt-to-Equity (D/E) Ratio
The D/E ratio measures a company's financial [leverage](../l/leverage.md) by dividing its [total liabilities](../t/total_liabilities.md) by shareholders' [equity](../e/equity.md). A lower D/E ratio typically signifies a company with less [risk](../r/risk.md) and can be an attractive quality for [value](../v/value.md) investors.

### 5. Free Cash Flow (FCF)
FCF is the cash that a company generates after [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for cash outflows to support operations and maintain its [capital](../c/capital.md) assets. A positive FCF indicates that the company has sufficient [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), making it attractive to [value](../v/value.md) investors.

# Value Investing

Value investing is a systematic approach to investing that involves buying securities that appear underpriced by some form of [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md). It is a strategy used by investors to seek out and purchase stocks that are believed to be trading for less than their intrinsic or book value. This strategy hinges on the idea that the market, while often efficient, can misprice assets temporarily, providing opportunities for investors to acquire good companies at bargain prices.

## Key Principles of Value Investing

### 1. Intrinsic Value
Intrinsic value is a core tenet of value investing. It refers to the actual worth of a company's stock, derived through quantitative measures such as earnings, dividends, cash flow, and other fundamental processes. Intrinsic value can be distinguished from market value, which can be influenced by market sentiment and speculation.

### 2. Margin of Safety
The margin of safety principle aims to mitigate risk by ensuring that the price paid for a security is significantly below its intrinsic value. This means that even if the company does not perform as well as expected, the investor has a lower likelihood of losing money.

### 3. Long-Term Investment Horizon
Value investors typically focus on the long-term potential of their investments. This approach involves holding securities for several years to allow their market prices to adjust to their intrinsic values. It counters the short-term speculation that often drives stock price volatility.

### 4. Fundamental Analysis
[Fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md) is the examination of a company's financial statements, including its balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement. Value investors analyze these documents to gauge the company's financial health and calculate its intrinsic value.

### 5. Contrarian Thinking
Value investing often involves a contrarian approach, where investors buy stocks that are currently unpopular or undervalued instead of following prevailing market trends. This approach requires a high level of discipline and independence of thought.

## Important Metrics in Value Investing

### 1. Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio
The P/E ratio is a widely used metric to determine if a stock is undervalued. It is calculated by dividing the current market price of a stock by its earnings per share (EPS). A low P/E ratio may suggest that the stock is undervalued.

### 2. Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio
The P/B ratio compares a company's market price to its book value. It is calculated by dividing the stock's market price by its book value per share. A lower P/B ratio indicates that the stock might be undervalued.

### 3. Dividend Yield
Dividend yield is another significant metric for value investors. It measures how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative to its stock price. A high dividend yield can be an indicator of an undervalued stock.

### 4. Debt-to-Equity (D/E) Ratio
The D/E ratio measures a company's financial leverage by dividing its total liabilities by shareholders' equity. A lower D/E ratio typically signifies a company with less risk and can be an attractive quality for value investors.

### 5. Free Cash Flow (FCF)
FCF is the cash that a company generates after accounting for cash outflows to support operations and maintain its capital assets. A positive FCF indicates that the company has sufficient liquidity, making it attractive to value investors.

# Voluntary Bankruptcy

Voluntary [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) is a legal process initiated by a debtor who seeks relief from [financial distress](../f/financial_distress.md) by filing a petition with a [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) court. This act of filing, known as petitioning for [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md), signifies that the debtor acknowledges their inability to pay outstanding debts and wishes to reorganize or [liquidate](../l/liquidate.md) their assets under the protection of the [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) laws. [Bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) laws vary by country, but the overall process generally follows similar principles.

## The Voluntary Bankruptcy Process

### Filing for Bankruptcy

The voluntary [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) process typically begins with the debtor, an individual, or a [corporation](../c/corporation.md), filing a petition in [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) court. The documentation required for filing includes:

- A detailed list of all assets and liabilities.
- A schedule of current [income](../i/income.md) and expenditures.
- Statements of financial affairs.
- Copies of recent tax returns.

### Types of Bankruptcy

There are several types of [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) that debtors can file for, with the most common types being:

- **Chapter 7 [Bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md)** ([Liquidation](../l/liquidation.md)): This type involves the [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md) of the debtor’s non-exempt assets by a [trustee](../t/trustee.md), with the proceeds distributed to creditors. It is typically suited for individuals or businesses that cannot feasibly continue operations.
  
- **[Chapter 11 Bankruptcy](../c/chapter_11_bankruptcy.md)** ([Reorganization](../r/reorganization.md)): More complex and commonly used by businesses, Chapter 11 allows the debtor to restructure their debts and operations. The [business](../b/business.md) can continue to operate while devising a plan to [return](../r/return.md) to profitability.

- **Chapter 13 [Bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md)** (Wage Earner’s Plan): This type is available to individuals with regular [income](../i/income.md) and involves creating a [repayment](../r/repayment.md) plan that lasts three to five years to pay off or settle debts.

### Role of Bankruptcy Trustee

Upon filing for [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md), a [trustee](../t/trustee.md) is appointed to oversee the case. The [trustee](../t/trustee.md)’s responsibilities include:

- Reviewing the petition and schedules.
- Ensuring that the debtor complies with all requirements.
- Liquidating non-exempt assets (in Chapter 7 cases).
- Overseeing the [reorganization](../r/reorganization.md) plan (in Chapter 11 cases).
- Distributing the proceeds to creditors.

### Automatic Stay

One of the significant protections offered by filing for [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) is the "automatic stay," which immediately goes into effect upon filing the petition. This stay halts most civil lawsuits against the debtor and stops all collection actions, including:

- Foreclosures.
- Repossessions.
- Evictions.
- Wage garnishments.
- [Utility](../u/utility.md) disconnections.

### Credit Counseling and Debtor Education

Before filing for [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md), debtors are generally required to complete [credit](../c/credit.md) counseling with an approved agency. Additionally, after filing, they must complete a debtor education course before receiving a discharge of their debts.

### Discharge of Debts

A discharge releases the debtor from personal [liability](../l/liability.md) for certain specified types of debts. This means that the debtor is no longer legally required to pay any debts that are discharged. However, not all types of debts can be discharged, including:

- Certain [taxes](../t/taxes.md).
- Child support and alimony.
- Student loans (under most circumstances).
- Debts for personal injury or death caused by the debtor's intoxicated driving.

## Voluntary Bankruptcy in Different Countries

### United States

In the United States, the process and laws governing voluntary [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) are codified under the U.S. [Bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) Code. The most common chapters under which debtors file are Chapter 7, Chapter 11, and Chapter 13, as previously mentioned.

### United Kingdom

In the UK, voluntary [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) is called "[bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md)" when initiated by an individual and "administration" or "[liquidation](../l/liquidation.md)" when initiated by a company. Individuals can petition the court for [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) or apply directly to an official receiver.

### Canada

In Canada, the process is governed by the [Bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) and [Insolvency](../i/insolvency.md) Act (BIA). Debtors can file a proposal or a [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md). A proposal involves negotiating new terms with creditors, while [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) involves the [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md) of assets to repay creditors.

# Veterans Administration

The Veterans Administration, commonly known as the VA, is a U.S. government agency that provides essential services to military veterans. Established in 1930, the VA is tasked with ensuring that veterans receive the healthcare, benefits, and support they require after serving in the armed forces. The VA's comprehensive suite of offerings includes medical care, educational benefits, home loans, life insurance, as well as various other forms of assistance designed to facilitate a veteran's transition back to civilian life.

## History and Evolution

The Veterans Administration was originally founded as the Veterans Bureau in 1921 but was reorganized into the Veterans Administration in 1930. This reformation aimed to consolidate the government's services for veterans under one umbrella, simplifying the bureaucratic processes and enhancing service delivery. In 1989, the Veterans Administration was elevated to a Cabinet-level agency and was renamed the Department of Veterans Affairs.

## Mission Statements and Core Values

The VA's mission is "to fulfill President Lincoln's promise 'To care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan' by serving and honoring the men and women who are America's veterans."

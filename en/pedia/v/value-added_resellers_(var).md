# Value-Added Resellers (VAR)

[Value](../v/value.md)-Added Resellers (VARs) [hold](../h/hold.md) a distinct position in the [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md) and [distribution](../d/distribution.md) networks across various industries, notably in technology and software. VARs purchase products from manufacturers, enhance them with additional features or services, and then resell those upgraded solutions to end-users. This model not only benefits the resellers through [margin](../m/margin.md) [expansion](../e/expansion.md) but also serves clients by providing more tailored and comprehensive solutions. 

## Historical Context

The concept of [Value](../v/value.md)-Added Resellers originated in the computer [industry](../i/industry.md) during the late 20th century. Initially, hardware and software companies sold their products directly to consumers or through broad-line distributors. However, as technology became more sophisticated, customers required additional services such as installation, customization, and ongoing support, which manufacturers were not equipped to provide. VARs emerged to bridge this gap, purchasing standard products, adding significant [value](../v/value.md), and [offering](../o/offering.md) the enhanced solutions to customers.

## Business Model

The core of a VAR's [business](../b/business.md) model lies in augmenting existing products with additional functionalities or services. This can take several forms:
- **Customization**: Tailoring software or hardware to meet specific [customer](../c/customer.md) requirements.
- **Integration**: Combining [multiple](../m/multiple.md) products to work seamlessly together.
- **Support Services**: Providing installation, training, maintenance, and technical support.
- **Consulting**: [Offering](../o/offering.md) expert advice on how best to use the products to achieve [business](../b/business.md) goals.

By doing so, VARs can justify a higher selling price and build stronger relationships with their customers, ultimately leading to [recurring revenue](../r/recurring_revenue.md) streams.

## Types of Value Addition

### Hardware Improvements

VARs can add [value](../v/value.md) to hardware in several ways. This might include pre-installing software, bundling hardware with necessary peripherals, or customizing systems to meet specific performance criteria. For instance, a VAR might buy basic servers and install specialized software, configure RAID setups, or enhance cooling systems to meet a particular client's requirements.

### Software Development

In the realm of software, VARs frequently develop custom modules or applications that [complement](../c/complement.md) existing software products. This can involve creating tailored reporting tools, integrating third-party applications, or developing mobile extensions for desktop software.

### Service Offerings

Another critical area of [value](../v/value.md) addition is services. VARs often provide end-to-end solutions that encompass everything from the initial [sale](../s/sale.md) to long-term support. For example, they may [offer](../o/offer.md) managed IT services, where they remotely manage a [customer](../c/customer.md)'s IT [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) and end-user systems on a proactive [basis](../b/basis.md).

## Benefits to Manufacturers

Manufacturers benefit significantly from working with VARs. Some key advantages include:
- **[Market](../m/market.md) Reach**: VARs can access markets and [customer](../c/customer.md) segments that the manufacturers might not be able to reach on their own.
- **Expertise**: VARs possess deep [industry](../i/industry.md)-specific knowledge and expertise, enabling them to position products more effectively and provide superior [customer service](../c/customer_service.md).
- **Focus**: By [outsourcing](../o/outsourcing.md) [value](../v/value.md)-added services to resellers, manufacturers can focus on their [core competencies](../c/core_competencies.md), such as product development and [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md).

## Benefits to End-Users

End-users also [gain](../g/gain.md) numerous advantages from working with VARs, including:
- **Tailored Solutions**: Customers receive products and services tailored to their specific needs, which can result in increased [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and effectiveness.
- **One-Stop-Shop**: VARs [offer](../o/offer.md) a single point of contact for a wide [range](../r/range.md) of services and support, simplifying vendor management and reducing administrative overhead.
- **Enhanced Support**: With a VAR, customers benefit from more responsive and personalized support, ensuring quick resolution of issues and minimal downtime.

## Challenges Faced by VARs

Despite their critical role in the [value chain](../v/value_chain.md), VARs face several challenges:
- **[Margin](../m/margin.md) Pressure**: As products and services become more commoditized, VARs often experience pressure on their margins.
- **Technological Changes**: Rapid technological advancements require continuous learning and adaptation, posing a resource challenge.
- **Competition**: The VAR [market](../m/market.md) is highly competitive, with many players vying for the same customers, making differentiation essential.

## Trends in the VAR Industry

### Cloud Computing

The shift towards [cloud computing](../c/cloud_computing_in_trading.md) has significantly impacted VARs. Traditional hardware and software sales are declining as businesses increasingly adopt cloud-based solutions. This has forced VARs to pivot, [offering](../o/offering.md) cloud services and transitioning to a subscription-based [business](../b/business.md) model.

### Managed Services

There is a growing [trend](../t/trend.md) towards managed services where VARs [offer](../o/offer.md) comprehensive IT management services for a recurring [fee](../f/fee.md). This model provides a stable [revenue](../r/revenue.md) stream and fosters long-term [customer](../c/customer.md) relationships.

### Cybersecurity

With the rising threat of cyber attacks, cybersecurity has become a critical area of focus for VARs. They are expanding their offerings to include advanced [security](../s/security.md) solutions, such as threat detection and response services.

## Case Study: Cisco Systems

Cisco Systems, a global leader in network and [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) solutions, works extensively with VARs. Cisco's partner program enables VARs to sell its products while [offering](../o/offering.md) additional services such as network design, installation, and support. Cisco provides training and certification programs for its VARs to ensure they possess the necessary expertise to deliver high-quality services.

## Conclusion

[Value](../v/value.md)-Added Resellers play an essential role in the modern [economy](../e/economy.md), [offering](../o/offering.md) enhanced solutions to customers while driving [value](../v/value.md) for manufacturers. As industries continue to evolve with technological advancements such as [cloud computing](../c/cloud_computing_in_trading.md) and cybersecurity, VARs must adapt to remain competitive. By staying ahead of trends and focusing on their strengths, VARs can continue to thrive and provide significant [value](../v/value.md) in the [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md).

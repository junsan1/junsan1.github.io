# Voting Shares

Voting [shares](../s/shares.md) represent a claim on part of a company's [capital](../c/capital.md) and come with voting rights attached. These [shares](../s/shares.md) are a type of [equity](../e/equity.md) stock and are often referred to as "common [shares](../s/shares.md)" or "ordinary [shares](../s/shares.md)" in different jurisdictions. While the primary advantage of owning voting [shares](../s/shares.md) is the ability to vote on corporate matters, they also allow shareholders to benefit financially from the company's performance through dividends and [capital](../c/capital.md) gains.

## Overview

Voting [shares](../s/shares.md) are fundamental instruments in the corporate world, providing shareholders with a voice in crucial [business](../b/business.md) decisions. This influence can be particularly significant during annual general meetings (AGMs) or extraordinary general meetings (EGMs), where shareholders vote on a variety of issues such as the election of the board of directors, mergers and acquisitions, and significant changes in corporate policies.

### Types of Shares

In the realm of [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md), there are different types of [shares](../s/shares.md):

1. **Voting [Shares](../s/shares.md) (Common or Ordinary [Shares](../s/shares.md)):**
    - Provide shareholders with the right to vote.
    - Typically, one vote per share.
    - Entitles shareholders to dividends, if declared, and residual claim over assets in the event of [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md).

2. **Non-Voting [Shares](../s/shares.md):**
    - Do not carry voting rights.
    - Often have higher [dividend](../d/dividend.md) rights or other financial benefits to compensate for the lack of voting power.

3. **Preferred [Shares](../s/shares.md):**
    - Generally, do not provide voting rights.
    - Have fixed dividends and priority over common [shares](../s/shares.md) in terms of [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payments and claim over assets upon [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md).

### Importance of Voting Shares

Voting [shares](../s/shares.md) are vital because they allow shareholders to influence the governance and strategic direction of the company. This democratic aspect ensures accountability and can lead to better decision-making within the company. Major [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) issues that voting shareholders typically decide include:

- **Election of Directors:** Shareholders elect the board of directors, who are responsible for overseeing the management of the company.
- **Approval of Major Transactions:** Voting [shares](../s/shares.md) allow shareholders to vote on mergers, acquisitions, and other significant corporate transactions.
- **Amendments to [Corporate Charter](../c/corporate_charter.md):** Any changes to the [corporate charter](../c/corporate_charter.md) or bylaws, which dictate the companyâ€™s internal rules, require [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) approval.
- **Executive Compensation:** Shareholders may vote on executive compensation plans, including [stock option](../s/stock_option.md) plans, bonuses, and salaries.

### Corporate Governance and Voting Shares

The mechanics of how voting [shares](../s/shares.md) influence [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) involve several layers, including:

- **[Proxy](../p/proxy.md) Voting:** Shareholders unable to attend meetings can vote by [proxy](../p/proxy.md), designating another person to vote on their behalf.
- **Cumulative Voting:** In some jurisdictions, cumulative voting is allowed, enabling shareholders to concentrate their votes on a specific candidate or [issue](../i/issue.md).
- **Dual-Class Structures:** Some companies [issue](../i/issue.md) [multiple](../m/multiple.md) classes of [shares](../s/shares.md) with different voting rights. Typically, one class of [shares](../s/shares.md) [will](../w/will.md) have enhanced voting rights, enabling founders or key stakeholders to maintain control.

## Examples of Companies with Voting Shares

## Implementation in Trading and Investing

When analyzing voting [shares](../s/shares.md) in the context of trading and [investing](../i/investing.md), a few points must be considered:

### Valuation and Market Perception

- **[Market](../m/market.md) [Premium](../p/premium.md):** Voting [shares](../s/shares.md) can sometimes [trade](../t/trade.md) at a [premium](../p/premium.md) compared to non-voting [shares](../s/shares.md) due to their governance influence.
- **[Investor](../i/investor.md) Sentiment:** The trading [volume](../v/volume.md) and [demand](../d/demand.md) for voting [shares](../s/shares.md) often reflect [investor](../i/investor.md) confidence in the company's governance.

### Strategies

- **Activist [Investing](../i/investing.md):** Investors, or groups of investors, accumulate significant voting [shares](../s/shares.md) to influence corporate policies or strategic direction.
- **[Arbitrage Opportunities](../a/arbitrage_opportunities.md):** Traders can exploit price discrepancies between voting and non-voting [shares](../s/shares.md).

### Risks

- **Concentration of Power:** Dual-class structures can result in a concentration of power among a few individuals, potentially leading to governance issues.
- **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) Concerns:** Voting [shares](../s/shares.md) may exhibit different [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) characteristics compared to non-voting [shares](../s/shares.md), affecting [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

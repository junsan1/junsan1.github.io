# Variable Life Insurance

Variable [Life Insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) (VLI) is a type of [permanent life insurance](../p/permanent_life_insurance.md) that combines the traditional protection of [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) with an investment component. This unique blend allows policyholders not only to provide a [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) to their beneficiaries but also to build cash [value](../v/value.md) through a variety of investment [options](../o/options.md).

## Key Features

### Death Benefit

The core function of any [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policy, including Variable [Life Insurance](../l/life_insurance.md), is to provide a [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) to the beneficiaries upon the death of the insured. The [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) in a VLI policy can be variable, meaning that it can increase or decrease based on the performance of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) investments.

### Cash Value Component

One of the distinguishing features of VLI is its cash [value](../v/value.md) component. As premiums are paid, a portion of the [money](../m/money.md) goes towards building cash [value](../v/value.md). This cash [value](../v/value.md) is invested in a [range](../r/range.md) of investment [options](../o/options.md), such as [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, and mutual funds. The policyholder has the ability to choose how the [money](../m/money.md) is invested, which can impact the growth rate of the cash [value](../v/value.md).

### Investment Options

Investment [options](../o/options.md) typically include a variety of sub-accounts that operate much like mutual funds. These sub-accounts can include investments in equities, [fixed income](../f/fixed_income.md), or even [money market](../m/money_market.md) instruments. The policyholder has the flexibility to allocate premiums among these various investment [options](../o/options.md) based on their [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) and financial goals.

### Policy Loans and Withdrawals

Policyholders can take loans or make withdrawals from the cash [value](../v/value.md) of a VLI policy. However, it's important to [note](../n/note.md) that loans must be repaid with [interest](../i/interest.md), and withdrawals may reduce the [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) and cash [value](../v/value.md).

## Benefits

### Potential for Higher Returns

Because the cash [value](../v/value.md) component can be invested in equities and other higher-yielding investments, there is potential for significant growth. This can lead to a higher [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) and more cash [value](../v/value.md) accumulation over time.

### Flexibility

Another advantage of Variable [Life Insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) is its flexibility. Policyholders have the option to adjust the [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) and the amount of premiums they pay. They can also choose how to allocate their investments, giving them control over their financial strategy.

### Tax Advantages

The cash [value](../v/value.md) growth in a VLI policy is [tax-deferred](../t/tax_deferred.md), meaning that policyholders don't pay [taxes](../t/taxes.md) on the gains until they withdraw the [money](../m/money.md). Additionally, the [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) is typically [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md) to beneficiaries.

## Risks

### Investment Risk

One of the primary downsides of VLI is the investment [risk](../r/risk.md). The cash [value](../v/value.md) is subject to [market](../m/market.md) fluctuations, and poor investment performance can lead to a decrease in the cash [value](../v/value.md) and even the [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md).

### Fees and Expenses

VLI policies often come with higher fees and expenses compared to other types of [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md). These can include management fees for the investment component, administrative fees, and mortality and [expense](../e/expense.md) charges. High fees can erode the cash [value](../v/value.md) and overall returns.

### Complex Structure

The complexity of VLI can be a drawback for some. The involvement of investment [options](../o/options.md), fees, and potential for variable death benefits can be confusing. It's crucial for policyholders to fully understand the policy terms and conditions before committing.

## Comparison with Other Life Insurance Types

### Term Life Insurance

Unlike Variable [Life Insurance](../l/life_insurance.md), [Term Life Insurance](../t/term_life_insurance.md) provides coverage for a specific period, such as 10, 20, or 30 years. It does not have an investment component, and there is no cash [value](../v/value.md). The premiums for term policies are generally lower than those for VLI.

### Whole Life Insurance

[Whole Life Insurance](../w/whole_life_insurance.md) also provides permanent coverage like VLI but with a [guaranteed death benefit](../g/guaranteed_death_benefit.md) and fixed premiums. It includes a cash [value](../v/value.md) component that grows at a guaranteed rate. Although [Whole Life Insurance](../w/whole_life_insurance.md) is less risky, it offers less potential for high returns compared to VLI.

### Universal Life Insurance

[Universal Life Insurance](../u/universal_life_insurance.md) offers flexible premiums and the ability to adjust the [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md), similar to VLI. However, its investment component is typically more conservative, often involving fixed [interest](../i/interest.md) or [market](../m/market.md)-indexed accounts instead of variable investments.

## Introduction to Vacation Home Investments

[Investing](../i/investing.md) in a vacation [home](../h/home.md) can be a [lucrative](../l/lucrative.md) venture, combining the perks of having a personal retreat with the possibility of generating rental [income](../i/income.md). However, there are numerous factors to consider before diving into this [market](../m/market.md), from the location and initial cost to the potential for rental [income](../i/income.md) and the expenses involved in maintaining the property.

## Understanding the Basics

### What is a Vacation Home?

A vacation [home](../h/home.md) is a property used primarily for recreational purposes and is often located in a desirable tourist destination.

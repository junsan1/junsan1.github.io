## Introduction to Vacation Home Investments

Investing in a vacation home can be a lucrative venture, combining the perks of having a personal retreat with the possibility of generating rental income. However, there are numerous factors to consider before diving into this market, from the location and initial cost to the potential for rental income and the expenses involved in maintaining the property.

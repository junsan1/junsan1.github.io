# Vertical Calendar Spread

The Vertical Calendar Spread is a sophisticated [options](../o/options.md) [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) designed to exploit differences in option premiums over different expiration dates. This strategy, commonly referred to as just a "Calendar Spread," combines buying and selling [options](../o/options.md) of the same type (calls or puts) at different expiration dates but at the same [strike price](../s/strike_price.md). It's often used to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) and [volatility](../v/volatility.md) in the [market](../m/market.md).

## Basic Concept

A Vertical Calendar Spread is typically constructed by purchasing a longer-term option and simultaneously selling a shorter-term option of the same type and [strike price](../s/strike_price.md). The strategy profits from the difference in [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) between the two [options](../o/options.md). Since [options](../o/options.md) lose their [extrinsic value](../e/extrinsic_value.md) as they approach expiration, the nearer-term option [will](../w/will.md) decay faster than the longer-term option, potentially allowing the [trader](../t/trader.md) to [profit](../p/profit.md) from this differential.

### Example

Assume you want to initiate a Calendar Spread on Stock XYZ, which is currently trading at $100. You might:
- Buy a three-month [call option](../c/call_option.md) with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $100 for $5.
- Sell a one-month [call option](../c/call_option.md) with the same [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $100 for $3.

In this example, your net cost (or [debit](../d/debit.md)) for entering the Calendar Spread is $2 ($5 paid for the long call minus $3 received from the [short call](../s/short_call.md)).

## Components of a Vertical Calendar Spread

### Bought Option (Long Leg)

This is the longer-term option that you purchase. It benefits from a slower rate of [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) and a potential increase in implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md). The goal is for this option to maintain more [value](../v/value.md) as time passes compared to the shorter-term option.

### Sold Option (Short Leg)

This is the shorter-term option that you sell. It benefits from quicker [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) and thus loses [value](../v/value.md) faster. The plan is to have this option expire worthless or at a much-reduced [value](../v/value.md), allowing the [trader](../t/trader.md) to buy it back cheaper or let it expire.

## Key Factors

### Time Decay (Theta)

[Theta](../t/theta.md) measures the rate at which an option's [value](../v/value.md) decreases as it approaches expiration. Calendar [Spreads](../s/spreads.md) rely heavily on the difference in [Theta](../t/theta.md) between the two [options](../o/options.md). The nearer-term option [will](../w/will.md) have a higher [Theta](../t/theta.md), meaning it [will](../w/will.md) lose [value](../v/value.md) faster as expiration approaches.

### Volatility (Vega)

[Vega](../v/vega.md) represents the sensitivity of an option's price to changes in implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md). Calendar [Spreads](../s/spreads.md) benefit from an increase in implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md), especially for the longer-term option. Higher [volatility](../v/volatility.md) increases the [option premium](../o/option_premium.md), potentially leading to greater profits.

### Strike Price Selection

Selecting the appropriate [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) is crucial for the success of a Calendar Spread. The [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) should be around the current price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). This ensures that the sold option decays faster while the bought option retains its [value](../v/value.md).

## Risk and Reward

### Limited Risk

The maximum loss for a Calendar Spread is limited to the net [debit](../d/debit.md) paid to enter the [trade](../t/trade.md). This predictable [risk](../r/risk.md) profile makes Calendar [Spreads](../s/spreads.md) appealing to traders managing their exposure.

### Profit Potential

The [profit](../p/profit.md) potential for a Calendar Spread is theoretically unlimited but is realistically confined by the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) and the price movement of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). The maximum [profit](../p/profit.md) typically occurs when the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price is at or near the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) at the expiration of the shorter-term option.

## Adjusting a Calendar Spread

### Rolling the Position

If the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price moves unfavorably, traders might "roll" the position. This involves closing the current Calendar Spread and opening a new one with different expiration dates or strike prices to better suit the new [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

### Adding Legs

Sometimes traders add more legs to a Calendar Spread to adjust the [risk](../r/risk.md)/reward profile. For example, creating a Double Calendar Spread by adding another Calendar Spread at a different [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).

## Use Cases

### Neutral Outlook

A classic Calendar Spread is a good choice when you expect little movement in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). The strategy profits from [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) and minimal price fluctuation.

### Volatility Play

Traders also use Calendar [Spreads](../s/spreads.md) to play [volatility](../v/volatility.md). For instance, entering a Calendar Spread before a significant event (like an [earnings report](../e/earnings_report.md)) and exiting afterward. The increase in implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md) can inflate the [option premium](../o/option_premium.md) of the longer-term option, leading to potential profits.

## Practical Considerations

### Liquidity

Ensure the [options](../o/options.md) you choose are [liquid](../l/liquid.md). High [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) means tighter [spreads](../s/spreads.md) between the [bid and ask](../b/bid_and_ask.md) prices, reducing [slippage](../s/slippage.md) and making it easier to enter and exit positions.

### Transaction Costs

Be mindful of [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md), as Calendar [Spreads](../s/spreads.md) involve [multiple](../m/multiple.md) legs. Some brokers charge lower fees for multi-[leg](../l/leg.md) strategies, so choose a [broker](../b/broker.md) accordingly.

### Example Brokers

- [Interactive Brokers](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/): Known for low-cost trading and advanced [options](../o/options.md) trading tools.
- [TD Ameritrade](https://www.tdameritrade.com/): Offers [robust](../r/robust.md) trading platforms and tools for [options](../o/options.md) traders.

## Conclusion

Vertical Calendar [Spreads](../s/spreads.md) are versatile and relatively low-[risk](../r/risk.md) [options](../o/options.md) strategies that can be profitable in various [market](../m/market.md) conditions. By understanding the roles of [time decay](../t/time_decay.md), [volatility](../v/volatility.md), and [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) selection, traders can effectively deploy Calendar [Spreads](../s/spreads.md) to generate [income](../i/income.md) or [hedge](../h/hedge.md) other positions. Always consider [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md) when selecting [options](../o/options.md) to ensure the strategy's [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md).

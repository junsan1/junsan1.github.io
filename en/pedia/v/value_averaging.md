# Value Averaging (VA)

[Value](../v/value.md) Averaging, also known as VA, is an [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) that involves making periodic contributions to an investment portfolio that aims to achieve a predetermined rate of growth or increase in [value](../v/value.md) over a set period. This method, attributed to Michael E. Edleson in his book "[Value](../v/value.md) Averaging: The Safe and Easy Strategy for Higher Investment Returns," serves as an alternative to the more common Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA).

## Key Concepts

### Investment Contributions
Unlike Dollar Cost Averaging, where an [investor](../i/investor.md) commits a fixed amount of [money](../m/money.md) at regular intervals, [Value](../v/value.md) Averaging adjusts the amount of each contribution based on the performance of the portfolio. If the portfolio's [value](../v/value.md) has grown more than expected, the contribution amount decreases; if it has underperformed, the contribution increases. This countercyclical approach aims to buy more when prices are low and less when prices are high.

### Target Value
The core idea of VA is to set a target [value](../v/value.md) or portfolio worth that you aim to reach at future dates. This target grows at a predetermined rate, which can be linear or exponential depending on the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s goals and [market](../m/market.md) expectations.

### Formula for Contributions
The amount to be invested at each interval can be determined by the formula:
\[ \text{Investment Amount} = \text{Target [Value](../v/value.md)} - \text{Current Portfolio [Value](../v/value.md)} - \text{Previous Contributions} \]

### Rebalancing
Due to fluctuating [market](../m/market.md) conditions, the VA strategy inherently requires more [active portfolio management](../a/active_portfolio_management.md) compared to DCA. Investors need to rebalance their contributions regularly to align with the target growth.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros
1. **Countercyclical Nature**: VA inherently buys more when prices are low and less when prices are high, potentially leading to better performance in volatile markets.
2. **Disciplined Approach**: Establishes a disciplined investment framework, which can help mitigate emotional investment decisions.

### Cons
1. **Complexity**: Requires more [active management](../a/active_management.md) and could be complex for novice investors.
2. **Higher Costs**: Potentially higher [transaction fees](../t/transaction_fees.md) due to frequent [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md).
3. **[Capital](../c/capital.md) Intensity**: May require larger investment infusions in bear markets to meet target values, necessitating [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).

## Example

Suppose an [investor](../i/investor.md) sets an initial portfolio goal of $10,000 to be achieved in four years, with quarterly contributions. They expect an annual growth rate of 8%, leading to a target portfolio [value](../v/value.md) as shown:

- **Year 1, Q1**: $10,000 * (1 + 0.02) = $10,200
- **Year 1, Q2**: $10,000 * (1 + 0.04) = $10,400
- **Year 1, Q3**: $10,000 * (1 + 0.06) = $10,600
- **Year 1, Q4**: $10,000 * (1 + 0.08) = $10,800

If the portfolio's [value](../v/value.md) after Q1 is $10,100, then:
\[ \text{Contribution for Q2} = \$10,400 - \$10,100 = \$300 \]

## Comparing VA and DCA

1. **[Market Timing](../m/market_timing.md)**: DCA avoids [timing the market](../t/timing_the_market.md) by staying consistent, while VA inherently adjusts for [market](../m/market.md) conditions.
2. **Management Intensity**: DCA requires minimal management once the investment plan is set, whereas VA demands ongoing adjustments and [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md).
3. **Performance**: Historical data indicates that VA can [outperform](../o/outperform.md) DCA in volatile markets, though both strategies generally perform well in steady uptrends.

## Tools and Calculators
Several financial tools and calculators aid in implementing VA strategies by automating the complex calculations and adjustments required. Some notable platforms include:

- **Financial Engines**: Provides [robust](../r/robust.md) financial advisory services including VA calculations. (Visit [Financial Engines](https://financialengines.com))
- **Portfolio Visualizer**: Offers various [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) simulators, including VA tools. (Visit [Portfolio Visualizer](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com))
- **Personal [Capital](../c/capital.md)**: While primarily focusing on [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md), it also aids in customized investment strategies. (Visit [Personal Capital](https://www.personalcapital.com))

## Real-World Applications

### Individual Investors
Individuals leveraging VA need a thorough understanding of their financial goals, [market](../m/market.md) conditions, and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) [options](../o/options.md). It is suitable for highly disciplined investors who regularly monitor and adjust their portfolios.

### Financial Advisors
Advisors can use VA to add [value](../v/value.md) to their services by [offering](../o/offering.md) a sophisticated and tailored [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) to clients seeking higher returns and willing to undertake a more actively managed approach.

### Institutional Investors
While less common in institutional settings due to the [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements and complexity, some [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds and portfolio managers utilize VA principles to optimize [fund](../f/fund.md) allocation strategies and enhance [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md).

## Conclusion

[Value](../v/value.md) Averaging presents a strategic methodology for disciplined investment and potential outperformance relative to more static approaches like Dollar Cost Averaging. Its emphasis on buying low and selling high, combined with the requirement for regular portfolio adjustments, can benefit investors aiming for steady growth with an acceptance of higher management complexity. To succeed with VA, investors must stay informed, maintain [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), and commit to a long-term investment perspective.

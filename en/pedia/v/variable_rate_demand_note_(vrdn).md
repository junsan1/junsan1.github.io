# Variable Rate Demand Note (VRDN)

A Variable Rate [Demand](../d/demand.md) [Note](../n/note.md) (VRDN) is a type of [municipal bond](../m/municipal_bond.md) that offers investors a short-term investment option with a [variable interest rate](../v/variable_interest_rate.md). These securities are typically issued with long maturities but include a "put" feature that allows investors to [demand](../d/demand.md) early [repayment](../r/repayment.md) of [principal](../p/principal.md), usually on short notice. VRDNs are unique in their structure, appealing to investors seeking higher yields compared to traditional [money market](../m/money_market.md) instruments while maintaining flexibility and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).

## Characteristics of VRDNs

### Variable Interest Rate
The [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) on VRDNs is reset at regular intervals, such as daily, weekly, or monthly, which aligns the [yield](../y/yield.md) closely with current [market](../m/market.md) conditions. The rate is typically pegged to a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md), such as the SIFMA Municipal [Swap](../s/swap.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) or another similar short-term [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md).

### Demand (Put) Feature
VRDNs include a [put option](../p/put.md) that allows the holder to [demand](../d/demand.md) [repayment](../r/repayment.md) of the [principal](../p/principal.md) at [par value](../p/par_value.md) on short notice, which can be as short as one day. This feature significantly reduces [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md) for investors since they can exit the investment if rates rise.

### Long-Term Maturity
Despite having short-term [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) resets and [demand](../d/demand.md) [options](../o/options.md), VRDNs are issued with long-term maturities, often ranging from 20 to 30 years. This long [maturity](../m/maturity.md) is more reflective of traditional [municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md) rather than short-term investment instruments.

### Credit Enhancement
To make VRDNs more attractive, issuers frequently obtain external [credit](../c/credit.md) enhancement, such as a [letter of credit](../l/letter_of_credit.md) or a [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) [facility](../f/facility.md) from a [bank](../b/bank.md). This ensures that there is a reliable party to provide the necessary funds if many investors decide to [exercise](../e/exercise.md) their [put options](../p/put_options.md) simultaneously.

## Issuers and Buyers
### Issuers
Municipalities and other governmental entities [issue](../i/issue.md) VRDNs to [finance](../f/finance.md) long-term projects while providing flexibility in [interest](../i/interest.md) payments and responding to [market](../m/market.md) conditions. Issuers benefit from potentially lower [interest](../i/interest.md) costs due to the short-term nature of the reset rates.

### Investors
Typical investors in VRDNs include institutional investors, such as [money market](../m/money_market.md) funds, [municipal bond](../m/municipal_bond.md) mutual funds, and high-net-worth individuals. These investors are attracted to the [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), [capital preservation](../c/capital_preservation.md), and relatively higher yields compared to other short-term securities.

## Benefits and Risks

### Benefits
1. **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)**: The [demand](../d/demand.md) feature means these notes can be sold back at [par value](../p/par_value.md), providing high [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).
2. **Higher Yields**: VRDNs generally [offer](../o/offer.md) higher yields than traditional [money market](../m/money_market.md) instruments.
3. **[Capital Preservation](../c/capital_preservation.md)**: The [principal](../p/principal.md) is returned [at par](../a/at_par.md), assuming no [credit](../c/credit.md) event with the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) or the enhancement provider.
4. **Tax Advantages**: Like other municipal securities, [interest](../i/interest.md) [income](../i/income.md) on VRDNs is often exempt from federal and sometimes state and local [taxes](../t/taxes.md).

### Risks
1. **[Credit Risk](../c/credit_risk.md)**: The [value](../v/value.md) of a VRDN depends on the [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) of both the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) and any [credit](../c/credit.md) enhancement provider.
2. **[Interest Rate Risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md)**: Although [interest](../i/interest.md) rates are reset frequently, significant [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) can still affect overall [yield](../y/yield.md).
3. **[Liquidity Risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md)**: While the put feature enhances [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), there could be delays or challenges if the [credit](../c/credit.md) enhancement [facility](../f/facility.md) faces difficulties.
4. **[Market Risk](../m/market_risk.md)**: Their [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md) may not be as [liquid](../l/liquid.md) as the [market](../m/market.md) for Treasury securities.

## Recent Trends and Developments
In recent years, the VRDN [market](../m/market.md) has seen some innovations and modifications in response to regulatory changes and evolving [market](../m/market.md) needs. For instance, the impact of the [Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act](../d/dodd-frank_wall_street_reform_and_consumer_protection_act.md) has led to changes in how [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) is assessed and how [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) facilities are structured. The rise of fintech also means there's an increasing use of technology to streamline the issuance and trading of VRDNs.

## Conclusion
Variable Rate [Demand](../d/demand.md) Notes [offer](../o/offer.md) a unique blend of long-term investment horizons with short-term [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and variable [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. This makes them particularly appealing to a [range](../r/range.md) of investors looking for high [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), tax advantages, and relatively stable returns. However, potential investors should be aware of the associated risks, particularly those related to [credit](../c/credit.md) and [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) fluctuations. Understanding these aspects can help investors make more informed decisions and optimize their portfolios in alignment with their [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) and investment goals.

# **Value Factor Investing**

Value [factor investing](../f/factor_investing.md), also known simply as [value investing](../v/value_investing.md), is a strategy that involves selecting stocks that appear to be trading for less than their intrinsic or book value. Value investors actively seek stocks of companies that they believe the market has undervalued. They believe that the market overreacts to good and bad news, resulting in stock price movements that do not correspond to a company's long-term fundamentals, leading to opportunities for investors to profit by purchasing when the price is deflated.

### Core Principles of Value Factor Investing

1. **Intrinsic Value:**
   - The concept of intrinsic value is central to [value investing](../v/value_investing.md). Unlike the market value, which is the price investors are currently willing to pay for a stock, intrinsic value is the perceived true value of the company based on an examination of its fundamentals.
   - Intrinsic value can be determined through various methods such as discounted cash flow analysis, earnings multiples, or book value.

2. **Margin of Safety:**
   - The margin of safety is a principle articulated by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd, which suggests buying securities when their market price is significantly below their intrinsic value in order to minimize investment risks.
   - This buffer ensures that even if the intrinsic value is somewhat overestimated, the investor still has a protected downside.

3. **Long-Term Perspective:**
   - [Value investing](../v/value_investing.md) typically involves a long-term investment horizon. Investors are less concerned with short-term price movements and more interested in the long-term performance of a company.

4. **[Fundamental Analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md):**
   - Investors perform [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md) to scrutinize a company's financial statements and health, management team, industry position, and competitive advantages.
   - Key metrics include the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), price-to-book ratio (P/B), debt-to-equity ratio, and dividend yield.

### Historical Context and Pioneers

[Value investing](../v/value_investing.md) has deep historical roots and has been popularized by several key figures in the financial world:

- **Benjamin Graham:** Often referred to as the "father of [value investing](../v/value_investing.md)," Graham was a professor at Columbia Business School and authored influential books like "[Security Analysis](../s/security_analysis.md)" (co-authored with David Dodd) and "The Intelligent Investor." His investing philosophy centers around buying undervalued stocks with a significant margin of safety.

- **Warren Buffett:** A protégé of Benjamin Graham, Buffett has become arguably the most famous value investor. Through his company, Berkshire Hathaway, he has amassed vast wealth following a value premise and adapting it to focus on quality businesses at fair prices rather than purely cheap assets.

### Methods to Identify Value Stocks

Value investors utilize various methodologies and [financial ratios](../f/financial_ratios.md) to conduct their analysis:

1. **Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E):**
   - The P/E ratio compares a company's current share price to its per-share earnings.
   - A low P/E ratio could indicate that a stock is undervalued relative to its earnings.

2. **Price-to-Book Ratio (P/B):**
   - The P/B ratio compares a company's market value to its book value.
   - A P/B ratio under 1 might suggest that a stock is undervalued, as it implies the stock is trading for less than the value of its assets minus liabilities.

3. **Dividend Yield:**
   - Dividend yield is a financial ratio that shows how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative to its share price.
   - High dividend yields may indicate undervalued stock or a company rewarding shareholders more generously.

4. **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:**
   - This ratio assesses a company's financial leverage by comparing its total liabilities to shareholder equity.
   - Lower debt-to-equity ratios suggest less risk, which is often attractive to value investors seeking firm financial foundations.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

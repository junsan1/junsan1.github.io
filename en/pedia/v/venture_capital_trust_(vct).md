# Venture Capital Trust (VCT)

A [Venture Capital](../v/venture_capital.md) [Trust](../t/trust.md) (VCT) is a publicly [listed](../l/listed.md) company in the UK designed to provide [capital](../c/capital.md) to small, expanding companies. These trusts [offer](../o/offer.md) the benefit of tax reliefs to individual investors who purchase their [shares](../s/shares.md). They operate within a government scheme aimed at boosting [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) by supporting entrepreneurial activities. VCTs are an important part of the financial ecosystem catering to high-[risk](../r/risk.md) and potentially high-reward opportunities.

## Meaning

VCTs are specialized investment vehicles that pool funds from investors to [finance](../f/finance.md) small, privately-owned enterprises often neglected by larger [private equity](../p/private_equity.md) firms and public markets due to their size, development stage, or [risk](../r/risk.md) profile. These trusts are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK and must adhere to stringent requirements concerning their operation and investments.

### Key Features of VCTs

1. **Publicly [Listed](../l/listed.md):**
   VCTs must be [listed](../l/listed.md) on the London Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (LSE), ensuring [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and [transparency](../t/transparency.md) for investors.
   
2. **Invests in SMEs:**
   At least 70% of the funds raised must be invested in qualifying small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) within three years of raising the [capital](../c/capital.md).

3. **Tax Benefits:**
   Investors can receive [income tax](../i/income_tax.md) relief of up to 30% on the amount invested, [capital gains tax](../c/capital_gains_tax.md) exemptions on disposals of VCT [shares](../s/shares.md), and [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md) dividends, making them highly attractive for higher-rate taxpayers.

4. **Professional Management:**
   VCTs are managed by professional investment teams with expertise in identifying, [financing](../f/financing.md), and nurturing small businesses.

## Types of VCTs

There are several types of VCTs, each with its focus and [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md). Here are the primary types:

### 1. Generalist VCTs

Generalist VCTs invest across a broad [range](../r/range.md) of sectors and stages of [business](../b/business.md) development. They provide a diversified portfolio to spread the [risk](../r/risk.md) among various industries such as technology, healthcare, and consumer services. This type of VCT appeals to investors looking for diversified exposure to the high-growth potential of emerging UK businesses.

### 2. Specialist VCTs

Specialist VCTs focus on specific sectors or types of investments. For example, certain VCTs may only invest in the [technology sector](../t/technology_sector.md) or companies developing renewable energy solutions. Specialist VCTs are suitable for investors who have strong convictions about particular sectors and wish to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on the growth within those areas.

### 3. Aim VCTs

Aim VCTs focus specifically on companies [listed](../l/listed.md) on the [Alternative Investment](../a/alternative_investment.md) [Market](../m/market.md) (AIM), a sub-[market](../m/market.md) of the London Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) catering to smaller, rapidly growing businesses. This type of VCT offers exposure to publicly-traded companies at an earlier growth stage than those on the main [market](../m/market.md).

### 4. Evergreen VCTs

Evergreen VCTs do not raise new funds continually but rather exist to manage a fixed pool of investments. They reinvest profits back into the existing portfolio or distribute them to investors. These types of VCTs are designed for longer-term investments and [offer](../o/offer.md) a way for investors to continually benefit from the growth of a fixed set of investments.

   The FCA regulates VCTs in the UK, ensuring they comply with the relevant laws and provide adequate [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and protection to investors.

2. **Qualifying Investments:**
   To maintain their VCT status and associated tax benefits, VCTs must ensure that a significant portion of their investments meet the criteria established by HM [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) & Customs (HMRC), including size, [industry](../i/industry.md), and development stage.

3. **Reporting and [Disclosure](../d/disclosure.md):**
   VCTs are required to maintain [transparency](../t/transparency.md) through regular reporting and [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) of their [holdings](../h/holdings.md), [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md), and any significant changes in [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) or management.

# Value Chain

The concept of the [value](../v/value.md) chain was introduced by Michael Porter in his 1985 book "[Competitive Advantage](../c/competitive_advantage.md): Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance." The [value](../v/value.md) chain is a strategic analysis tool used to identify the [business activities](../b/business_activities.md) that create [value](../v/value.md) for a company. It splits overall [business activities](../b/business_activities.md) into primary and support activities, revealing the areas where businesses can achieve cost advantages or differentiate their products.

## Primary Activities

## Conclusion

The [value](../v/value.md) chain is a powerful framework for identifying and optimizing the activities that contribute to a companyâ€™s [competitive advantage](../c/competitive_advantage.md). By understanding all distinct activities within a company and the interplay between them, businesses can refine their strategies to improve efficiencies and [customer](../c/customer.md) [value](../v/value.md). In the [financial sector](../f/financial_sector.md), especially with the emergence of fintech, applying a [value chain analysis](../v/value_chain_analysis.md) can lead to revolutionary improvements in operations, [marketing](../m/marketing.md), [customer service](../c/customer_service.md), and overall [value](../v/value.md) delivery.

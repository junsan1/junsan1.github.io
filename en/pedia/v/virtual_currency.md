# Virtual Currency

Virtual [currency](../c/currency.md) is a type of unregulated [digital money](../d/digital_money.md), issued and controlled by its developers, and used and accepted among the members of a specific virtual community. Unlike traditional currencies such as the dollar or [euro](../e/euro.md), virtual currencies rely heavily on the decentralized nature of their protocols and the cryptographic techniques used for their generation and validation. This text [will](../w/will.md) delve into the concept of virtual [currency](../c/currency.md), its difference from digital and crypto-currencies, its application in various domains, and its advantages and disadvantages.

## Definition and Characteristics

Virtual [currency](../c/currency.md) is defined by the European Central [Bank](../b/bank.md) as "a type of unregulated, [digital money](../d/digital_money.md), which is issued and usually controlled by its developers, and used and accepted among the members of a specified virtual community." The key characteristics of virtual currencies include:

- **Decentralization**: Unlike traditional currencies controlled by central banks, virtual currencies are typically not governed by any central authority.
- **Digital Nature**: Virtual currencies exist only in digital form, without a physical embodiment.
- **Peer-to-Peer Transactions**: Transactions can be made directly between parties without an intermediary.
- **Cryptography**: Most virtual currencies use cryptographic techniques to ensure transactional [security](../s/security.md).

## Types of Virtual Currencies

### 1. Centralized vs. Decentralized
- **Centralized Virtual Currencies**: These are controlled by a central entity. An example is the in-game currencies used in various online games.
- **Decentralized Virtual Currencies**: These operate without a central authority, such as [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) and other cryptocurrencies.

### 2. Closed vs. Open Virtual Currencies
- **Closed Virtual Currencies**: These are used within a particular virtual environment and have no connection to the real [economy](../e/economy.md). For example, the points in a [loyalty program](../l/loyalty_program.md).
- **[Open](../o/open.md) Virtual Currencies**: These can be exchanged for real-world goods and services. Cryptocurrencies like [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) fall into this category.

## Difference Between Virtual, Digital, and Cryptocurrency

- **Virtual [Currency](../c/currency.md)**: A broader term that includes digital currencies and cryptocurrencies. It is not regulated and is used within a particular community.
- **[Digital Currency](../d/digital_currency.md)**: Encompasses all forms of [electronic money](../e/electronic_money.md), including virtual currencies and cryptocurrencies. [Digital currency](../d/digital_currency.md) may or may not use cryptography.
- **Cryptocurrency**: A subset of [digital currency](../d/digital_currency.md) that uses cryptographic techniques for [security](../s/security.md) and operates on decentralized networks, such as [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md).

## Examples of Virtual Currencies

### Cryptocurrency Examples
- **[Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) (BTC)**: The first and most well-known decentralized virtual [currency](../c/currency.md).
- **[Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) (ETH)**: A decentralized platform that runs [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md) and its own cryptocurrency.

### Non-Cryptocurrency Examples
- **Linden Dollars**: Used in the virtual world Second Life.
- **World of Warcraft Gold**: The [currency](../c/currency.md) used in the game World of Warcraft.
- **V-Bucks**: [Currency](../c/currency.md) used in Fortnite, which can be purchased with real [money](../m/money.md) but can't be exchanged back.

## Applications

### Gaming
Virtual currencies are predominantly used in the gaming [industry](../i/industry.md). Players often purchase [virtual goods](../v/virtual_good.md) and services within games using game-specific currencies. 

### Financial Services
In the financial [industry](../i/industry.md), virtual currencies like [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) and [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) enable peer-to-peer transactions without the need for an intermediary, reducing [transaction fees](../t/transaction_fees.md) and time.

### Online Marketplaces
Some online marketplaces accept virtual currencies for purchasing goods and services. For instance, OverStock.com and Newegg accept [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) as a form of [payment](../p/payment.md).

### Crowdfunding
Platforms like Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) have used virtual currencies as a method to raise [capital](../c/capital.md). [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md), in particular, has been popular for its capability to create new tokens.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

- **Lower [Transaction Fees](../t/transaction_fees.md)**: Virtual currencies typically have lower fees compared to traditional [payment](../p/payment.md) methods.
- **Global Transactions**: They can be sent and received anywhere in the world.
- **Privacy and [Security](../s/security.md)**: Cryptographic techniques provide a high level of [security](../s/security.md), and some [offer](../o/offer.md) a degree of anonymity.
- **Decentralization**: Lack of central authority makes these currencies immune to government control and interference.

### Disadvantages

- **Regulatory Concerns**: The unregulated nature makes virtual currencies susceptible to legal and regulatory challenges.
- **[Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: Prices of virtual currencies can be highly volatile.
- **[Security](../s/security.md) Risks**: Despite [security](../s/security.md) measures, exchanges and wallets can be hacked.
- **Limited Acceptance**: Not universally accepted as a form of [payment](../p/payment.md).

## Future Outlook

The future of virtual currencies is promising, with increasing adoption and integration into various sectors. However, there are significant hurdles in terms of regulatory acceptance and technical [scalability](../s/scalability.md) that need to be overcome. Innovations in [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology, regulatory frameworks, and enhanced [security](../s/security.md) protocols [will](../w/will.md) play crucial roles in shaping the future landscape of virtual currencies.

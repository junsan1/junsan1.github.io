# Veterans Group Life Insurance (VGLI)

Veterans [Group Life Insurance](../g/group_life_insurance.md) (VGLI) is a [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) program that provides [term life insurance](../t/term_life_insurance.md) coverage to veterans. It is designed to provide financial [security](../s/security.md) to the families of veterans in the event of their death. This program is part of the many benefits offered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to support those who have served in the United States armed forces. VGLI serves as an extension of the Servicemembers' [Group Life Insurance](../g/group_life_insurance.md) (SGLI), which offers [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) coverage to active duty service members.

## Eligibility and Enrollment

### Eligibility Criteria

To qualify for VGLI, veterans must have been covered by SGLI during their time of service and must apply for VGLI within a certain timeframe after leaving the military. The specific eligibility criteria include:

- Veterans who had SGLI coverage while in service.
- Service members who are within one year and 120 days (485 days) from their date of separation or retirement from service.
- Members of the National Guard or Reserves who had part-time SGLI coverage and lost eligibility due to separation, discharge, or retirement.

### Enrollment Process

Veterans can apply for VGLI online through the VA's website, via mail, or with the help of a VA benefits advisor. The application process requires the veteran to provide information such as their separation date, proof of SGLI coverage, and personal details. It is crucial to apply within the first 240 days after separation to avoid the requirement of providing proof of good health. Applications submitted after this period and within one year and 120 days post-separation [will](../w/will.md) require evidence of insurability.

## Coverage and Premiums

### Coverage Amounts

VGLI coverage amounts can [range](../r/range.md) from $10,000 to $400,000, depending on the veteran's existing SGLI coverage and their personal financial needs. Coverage is provided in increments of $10,000, and veterans have the flexibility to adjust their coverage amount over time, although increases are typically subject to proof of good health.

### Premiums

Premiums for VGLI are based on the veteran's age and the amount of coverage chosen. The premiums are fixed for each age bracket and increase as the policyholder ages. The VA provides a [premium](../p/premium.md) rate table that helps veterans estimate their [premium](../p/premium.md) costs based on different coverage amounts and age groups.

## Benefits of VGLI 

### No Health Examination Requirement (Within 240 Days)

One of the key benefits of VGLI is that veterans have 240 days from the date of their separation to apply without needing to undergo a health examination or provide proof of good health. This is particularly advantageous for veterans who may have developed health issues during their service or post-separation.

### Convertible to Individual Policies

VGLI policies are convertible to individual commercial [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policies at any time. This conversion can provide long-term [security](../s/security.md) beyond the term life coverage offered by VGLI. Veterans can choose from several participating [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies to convert their VGLI coverage without undergoing a medical examination.

### Portability

VGLI offers portability, meaning the coverage stays with the veteran regardless of changes in employment, location, or other life circumstances. This feature ensures continuous [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) protection as veterans transition from military to civilian life.

### Spouse and Dependent Coverage

Although VGLI itself only covers the veteran, there are [options](../o/options.md) available through the VA to insure spouses and dependents. One such option is Family Servicemembers' [Group Life Insurance](../g/group_life_insurance.md) (FSGLI), which provides [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) coverage to the spouse and dependent children of service members and veterans.

## Comparison with Other Life Insurance Options

### Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance (SGLI)

SGLI is the precursor to VGLI and provides coverage to active duty service members. Coverage amounts are similar, but SGLI [premium](../p/premium.md) rates are typically lower due to the group nature of the policy and the younger, healthier pool of insured members.

### Private Life Insurance

Veterans have the option to purchase [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) from private insurers as an alternative to VGLI. While private policies may [offer](../o/offer.md) lower rates for individuals in good health, they often require medical examinations and [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md). Some veterans may find that VGLI provides a more straightforward and accessible solution without the need for extensive health scrutiny.

## How to Apply

Veterans can apply for VGLI through the following methods:

- **Online**: By using the VA's [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) website, veterans can complete and submit an online application.
- **Mail**: Veterans can download the application form (VA Form 29-8714), fill it out, and mail it to the appropriate address.
- **In Person**: Assistance with the application can be obtained from a VA benefits advisor at local VA offices.

To apply online or learn more, veterans can visit the VA's official [insurance](../i/insurance.md) webpage: [VA Life Insurance](https://www.benefits.va.gov/insurance/vgli.asp).

## Managing VGLI Policy

### Updating Beneficiaries

It is essential for veterans to keep their [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md) information up to date to ensure that the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) benefits are disbursed according to their wishes. [Beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md) updates can be made online, by mail, or by contacting the VA [insurance](../i/insurance.md) office.

### Adjusting Coverage

Veterans can request changes to their coverage amount, though increases in coverage may require proof of good health if requested after the initial 240-day period. Decreases in coverage can be requested at any time.

### Paying Premiums

Premiums can be paid through various methods, including direct [debit](../d/debit.md), [credit card](../c/credit_card.md), or by setting up automatic payments from a [checking account](../c/checking_account.md). The VA provides flexible [payment](../p/payment.md) [options](../o/options.md) to accommodate the financial preferences of veterans.

## FAQs

### What happens if a veteran misses the initial application window?

Veterans who miss the 240-day application window can still apply for VGLI within one year and 120 days after separation from service, but they [will](../w/will.md) need to provide proof of good health.

### Can VGLI coverage be transferred to a civilian employer's group life insurance policy?

No, VGLI coverage is maintained independently of any civilian employer's [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policies. However, veterans always have the option to convert their VGLI coverage to a commercial individual policy at any time.

### Is there a cash value associated with VGLI?

No, VGLI is a [term life insurance](../t/term_life_insurance.md) policy and does not [accrue](../a/accrue.md) cash [value](../v/value.md). It provides pure [insurance](../i/insurance.md) protection without any savings or investment component.

### What is the process for filing a claim?

Beneficiaries can file a claim by contacting the VA [insurance](../i/insurance.md) office and providing the necessary documentation, including the death certificate of the insured veteran. The VA offers resources and assistance to help beneficiaries through the claims process.

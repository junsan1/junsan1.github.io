# Volatility Index Futures

### Introduction to Volatility Index Futures

[Volatility](../v/volatility.md) [Index Futures](../i/index_futures.md), commonly known in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) as VIX [futures](../f/futures.md) or [volatility](../v/volatility.md) [futures](../f/futures.md), are [exchange](../e/exchange.md)-traded [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) that allow investors to wager on the future [volatility](../v/volatility.md) of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). The [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) for these contracts is the [Volatility](../v/volatility.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (VIX), which measures the [market](../m/market.md)'s expectation of 30-day future [volatility](../v/volatility.md) implicit in the prices of S&P 500 [index options](../i/index_options.md). The VIX [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) is often referred to as the "fear gauge" because it capitalizes on [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) and potential future [risk](../r/risk.md), especially during periods of financial stress or [market](../m/market.md) downturns.

### The VIX Index

The VIX [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) is compiled by the Chicago Board [Options](../o/options.md) [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (CBOE) and is a real-time [market index](../m/market_index.md) representing the [market](../m/market.md)'s expectations for [volatility](../v/volatility.md) over the coming 30 days. Introduced in 1993, the VIX [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) quickly became the standard measure of [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md). It is calculated based on the prices of near-term S&P 500 [options](../o/options.md), both puts, and calls.

### Mechanics of VIX Futures

VIX [futures](../f/futures.md) are standardized contracts traded on exchanges such as the CBOE [Futures](../f/futures.md) [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (CFE). These contracts are used to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against risks or to speculate on the future direction of [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md). Each VIX future has a specific [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md), and as the [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md) approaches, the price of the VIX future converges to the level of the VIX [Index](../i/index_instrument.md).

Key elements of VIX [futures](../f/futures.md) include:
- **Contract Size**: Typically, VIX [futures](../f/futures.md) have a contract [multiplier](../m/multiplier.md) of $1,000 times the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) level.
- **[Tick Size](../t/tick_size.md)**: The minimum price movement ([tick size](../t/tick_size.md)) is usually 0.05 [index](../i/index_instrument.md) points, which corresponds to a move of $50 per contract.
- **Expiration Cycle**: VIX [futures](../f/futures.md) expire every Wednesday that is 30 days prior to the third Friday of the following calendar month. Different month contracts allow for hedging needs across various time horizons.
  
### Pricing and the Term Structure of VIX Futures

The pricing of VIX [futures](../f/futures.md) differs from the actual VIX [index](../i/index_instrument.md) [value](../v/value.md) due to the relationship between spot and [futures](../f/futures.md) prices, and factors such as carry costs, [risk](../r/risk.md) premiums, and [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md). VIX [futures](../f/futures.md) often exhibit a term structure that can be in [contango](../c/contango.md) (upward-sloping) or [backwardation](../b/backwardation.md) (downward-sloping). 

- **[Contango](../c/contango.md)**: This occurs when [futures](../f/futures.md) prices are higher than the current [spot price](../s/spot_price.md). [Contango](../c/contango.md) reflects the cost of carry and also the [market](../m/market.md)'s anticipation of higher [volatility](../v/volatility.md) in the future.
- **[Backwardation](../b/backwardation.md)**: This happens when [futures](../f/futures.md) prices are lower than the [spot price](../s/spot_price.md), indicating that the [market](../m/market.md) expects lower [volatility](../v/volatility.md) in the future.

### Applications of VIX Futures

VIX [futures](../f/futures.md) serve [multiple](../m/multiple.md) purposes in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md):
1. **Hedging**: Investors often use VIX [futures](../f/futures.md) to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against potential declines in the [value](../v/value.md) of their portfolios, as VIX levels generally increase during [market](../m/market.md) downturns.
2. **[Speculation](../s/speculation.md)**: Traders take positions in VIX [futures](../f/futures.md) to [profit](../p/profit.md) from expected changes in [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md).
3. **[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**: Professional traders and institutions may engage in [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategies to exploit discrepancies between the spot VIX [index](../i/index_instrument.md) and [futures](../f/futures.md) prices.

### Strategies Involving VIX Futures

Several [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) involve VIX [futures](../f/futures.md):
- **[Volatility](../v/volatility.md) Hedging**: To protect against [market](../m/market.md) downturns, traders might buy VIX [futures](../f/futures.md), benefiting if the [market](../m/market.md) becomes more volatile.
- **[Spread Trading](../s/spread_trading.md)**: This involves taking positions in different VIX [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) to exploit the term structure, i.e., the difference between near-term and longer-term [futures](../f/futures.md).
- **Calendar [Spreads](../s/spreads.md)**: Involves buying and selling [futures](../f/futures.md) of different expirations to [profit](../p/profit.md) from the changes in the time spread.
- **[Pairs Trading](../p/pairs_trading.md)**: Combining VIX [futures](../f/futures.md) with other instruments, such as S&P 500 [futures](../f/futures.md), to create a strategy aiming to [profit](../p/profit.md) from the relative movement between [market](../m/market.md) indices and [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

### Risks and Challenges

While VIX [futures](../f/futures.md) provide powerful tools for investors and traders, they come with inherent risks:
- **High [Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: VIX [futures](../f/futures.md) themselves can be highly volatile, and improper use can lead to significant losses.
- **Complex Pricing**: The pricing of VIX [futures](../f/futures.md) is influenced by various factors, including [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md), making it challenging for some traders to predict future movements accurately.
- **[Contango](../c/contango.md) Risks**: In a [contango](../c/contango.md) [market](../m/market.md), holding long positions in VIX [futures](../f/futures.md) over time could lead to losses due to the eroding effect of roll costs.

### Market Participants

Key participants in the VIX [futures market](../f/futures_market.md) include:
- **[Hedge](../h/hedge.md) Funds**: [Hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds use VIX [futures](../f/futures.md) to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) their positions or to speculate on [market](../m/market.md) movements.
- **Institutional Investors**: Large institutional investors use these instruments as part of their [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) strategies.
- **Retail Traders**: Individual traders and smaller funds participate in VIX [futures](../f/futures.md) for [diversification](../d/diversification.md) and speculative purposes.

### Conclusion

VIX [futures](../f/futures.md) are sophisticated financial instruments that play a crucial role in modern [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). They provide a mechanism for traders and investors to express their views on future [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md). While they [offer](../o/offer.md) substantial opportunities for hedging and [speculation](../s/speculation.md), the complexity and risks involved necessitate a deep understanding of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) mechanics and potential [market](../m/market.md) behaviors. As a result, investors must approach VIX [futures](../f/futures.md) with a well-considered strategy and a keen awareness of the [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md).

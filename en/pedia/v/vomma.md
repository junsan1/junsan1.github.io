# Vomma

In the complex world of [options](../o/options.md) trading, various [Greeks](../g/greeks.md) are utilized to measure different aspects of [risk](../r/risk.md) and their potential impacts on the price of [options](../o/options.md). One such Greek is Vomma. Vomma, also known as Volga, is a second-[order](../o/order.md) Greek that quantifies the sensitivity of an option's [vega](../v/vega.md) to changes in implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

Vomma is particularly important for traders who are engaged in [options trading strategies](../o/options_trading_strategies.md) that are highly sensitive to changes in [volatility](../v/volatility.md). This includes strategies such as [volatility](../v/volatility.md) trading, [delta](../d/delta.md)-[neutral](../n/neutral.md) strategies, and other sophisticated trading techniques that require an acute understanding of how [volatility](../v/volatility.md) impacts option prices.

## Definition

Vomma measures the rate at which an option's [vega](../v/vega.md) changes as the [volatility](../v/volatility.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) changes. Specifically, it is the second [derivative](../d/derivative.md) of the option's price with respect to the [volatility](../v/volatility.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). This makes Vomma a higher-[order](../o/order.md) measure of [risk](../r/risk.md), capturing the "[convexity](../c/convexity.md)" of an option's [vega](../v/vega.md) with respect to changes in [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

Mathematically, Vomma can be expressed as follows:

$$ Vomma = \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial \sigma^2} $$

where \( V \) represents the option price and \( \sigma \) represents the [volatility](../v/volatility.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

## Importance

Vomma is crucial for several reasons:

1. **[Volatility](../v/volatility.md) Management**: For traders who are exposed to [volatility](../v/volatility.md) risks, understanding Vomma can help manage these risks more effectively. By knowing how [vega](../v/vega.md) [will](../w/will.md) change as [volatility](../v/volatility.md) changes, traders can better position themselves to either [profit](../p/profit.md) from or [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against these changes.
  
2. **Portfolio Adjustment**: Traders who use [delta](../d/delta.md)-[neutral](../n/neutral.md) strategies, which aim to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) out price movements of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), need to be aware of Vomma to adjust their portfolios appropriately when [volatility](../v/volatility.md) changes.
  
3. **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Measurement**: Vomma provides an insightful measure of an option's sensitivity to the second [derivative](../d/derivative.md) of [volatility](../v/volatility.md). This is essential for assessing the [risk](../r/risk.md) in more sophisticated [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

## Calculation

The formula for Vomma is generally derived from the [Black-Scholes model](../b/black-scholes_model.md), a widely used option pricing model. While the exact derivation is complex and involves partial differential equations, the simplified formula often used in practice is:

$$ Vomma = V \times \mathcal{N}'(d_1) \times \sqrt{T} \times \left( \frac{d_1d_2}{\sigma} \right) $$

Here:
- \( V \) is the price of the option.
- \( \mathcal{N}' \) is the standard normal probability density function.
- \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \) are parameters from the [Black-Scholes model](../b/black-scholes_model.md).
- \( T \) is the time to expiration.
- \( \sigma \) is the [volatility](../v/volatility.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

## Applications

### Hedging Strategies

In trading, one often constructs portfolios to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against various risks. Vomma is used in more advanced [hedging strategies](../h/hedging_strategies.md) to manage the exposure of [vega](../v/vega.md) to changes in [volatility](../v/volatility.md). For example, a portfolio that is [vega](../v/vega.md)-[neutral](../n/neutral.md) but has a significant vomma exposure [will](../w/will.md) perform differently in varying [volatility](../v/volatility.md) environments. Understanding this can allow traders to add or subtract positions to adjust this higher-[order](../o/order.md) [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Volatility Arbitrage

In [volatility arbitrage](../v/volatility_arbitrage.md), traders attempt to exploit discrepancies between the implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md) of [options](../o/options.md) and the expected future [volatility](../v/volatility.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). Vomma provides an additional layer of understanding that can be pivotal in identifying and exploiting these opportunities. For instance, if a [trader](../t/trader.md) anticipates a significant change in [volatility](../v/volatility.md), understanding vomma helps in positioning the portfolio to benefit from such changes.

### Risk Management

[Risk](../r/risk.md) managers in financial institutions often use Vomma along with other [Greeks](../g/greeks.md) to ascertain the [risk](../r/risk.md) profile of the [firm](../f/firm.md)'s [options](../o/options.md) positions. By incorporating Vomma into their [risk metrics](../r/risk_metrics.md), they can [gain](../g/gain.md) a more nuanced understanding of how their portfolio [will](../w/will.md) react not only to changes in [underlying](../u/underlying.md) price and [volatility](../v/volatility.md) but also to changes in the rate of change of [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

## Practical Usage

To illustrate the practical application of Vomma, consider a scenario where a [trader](../t/trader.md) holds a portfolio consisting primarily of call [options](../o/options.md). If they expect that the [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) is going to increase significantly in the near future, they can use Vomma to estimate how much the [vega](../v/vega.md) of their portfolio [will](../w/will.md) change. Based on this estimate, they might adjust their positions by buying or selling further [options](../o/options.md) to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) themselves against this anticipated change in [vega](../v/vega.md).

Additionally, Vomma can be used to optimize [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) that are specifically designed to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on changes in [volatility](../v/volatility.md). For example, [straddle](../s/straddle.md) and [strangle](../s/strangle.md) strategies, which involve buying both call and [put options](../p/put_options.md) at different strike prices, can be fine-tuned using Vomma to maximize profitability under anticipated [volatility](../v/volatility.md) scenarios.

## Conclusion

Vomma plays an indispensable role in the high-stakes world of [options](../o/options.md) trading. It offers a more granular perspective on how option prices [will](../w/will.md) behave under varying [volatility](../v/volatility.md) conditions, providing traders and [risk](../r/risk.md) managers with the information they need to adjust positions and manage risks effectively. While not as commonly discussed as other [Greeks](../g/greeks.md) like [delta](../d/delta.md), [gamma](../g/gamma.md), or [vega](../v/vega.md), Vomma holds its significance for those deeply involved in advanced [options trading strategies](../o/options_trading_strategies.md).

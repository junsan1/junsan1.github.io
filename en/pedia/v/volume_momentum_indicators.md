# Volume Momentum Indicators

Volume [momentum indicators](../m/momentum_indicators.md) are tools used in [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) to gauge the strength or weakness of price movements based on volume. These indicators combine [price momentum](../p/price_momentum.md) with volume to provide insights into the current state and potential future movements of an asset. They help traders and investors identify trends, determine the strength of price movements, and spot trading opportunities. Various volume [momentum indicators](../m/momentum_indicators.md) are employed in [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), each offering unique advantages and interpretations.

## Types of Volume Momentum Indicators

### 1. On-Balance Volume (OBV)

On-Balance Volume (OBV) is a simple cumulative volume-based indicator that adds volume on up days and subtracts volume on down days. OBV provides insights into whether volume is following or leading price movements.

##### Calculation:
- If the closing price is higher than the previous close, today's volume is added to the previous OBV.
- If the closing price is lower than the previous close, today's volume is subtracted from the previous OBV.

OBV can indicate the strength of a price move. A rising OBV suggests that buying volume is stronger, often preceding price increases, while a falling OBV indicates stronger selling volume, often preceding price declines.

### 2. Volume Price Trend (VPT)

The Volume Price Trend (VPT) indicator combines price and volume to provide insights into the strength of a price trend. It accumulates a percentage change in price and volume over time.

##### Calculation:
\[ \text{VPT}(i) = \text{VPT}(i-1) + \left( \frac{\text{Close}(i) - \text{Close}(i-1)}{\text{Close}(i-1)} \right) \times \text{Volume}(i) \]

VPT helps determine the balance between demand and supply and can indicate whether a trend is likely to continue or reverse.

### 3. Chaikin Money Flow (CMF)

The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator uses both price and volume to measure the buying and selling pressure over a specific period. It ranges from -1 to +1.

##### Calculation:
\[ \text{CMF} = \frac{ \sum_{i=n}^{m} \text{ADL}_{i} \times \text{Volume}_{i} }{ \sum_{i=n}^{m} \text{Volume}_{i} } \]

where ADL (Accumulation/Distribution Line) is calculated as:
\[ \text{ADL} = \frac{ (\text{Close} - \text{Low}) - (\text{High} - \text{Close}) }{ \text{High} - \text{Low} } \]

A positive CMF value indicates buying pressure, while a negative CMF value indicates selling pressure.

### 4. Money Flow Index (MFI)

The Money Flow Index (MFI) is a volume-weighted version of the Relative Strength Index (RSI). It ranges from 0 to 100 and is used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in the market.

##### Calculation:
\[ \text{MFI} = 100 - \left( \frac{100}{1 + \text{Money Flow Ratio}} \right) \]

The Money Flow Ratio is the ratio of positive money flow to negative money flow over a specified period. Positive money flow is calculated when the typical price is higher than the previous typical price, and negative money flow is calculated when the typical price is lower.

### 5. Volume Oscillator

The [Volume Oscillator](../v/volume_oscillator.md) measures the difference between two moving averages of volume, providing insights into changes in volume trends.

##### Calculation:
\[ \text{[Volume Oscillator](../v/volume_oscillator.md)} = \frac{ \text{Short-term MA of Volume} - \text{Long-term MA of Volume} }{ \text{Long-term MA of Volume} } \times 100 \]

A positive value indicates increasing volume, while a negative value suggests decreasing volume.

### 6. Force Index (FI)

The Force Index (FI) is an indicator that uses price and volume to assess the power behind a price movement.

##### Calculation:
\[ \text{Force Index} = \text{Volume} \times (\text{Close} - \text{Previous Close}) \]

A positive Force Index suggests buying pressure, while a negative Force Index indicates selling pressure.

### 7. Negative Volume Index (NVI) and Positive Volume Index (PVI)

The Negative Volume Index (NVI) and Positive Volume Index (PVI) are indicators that focus on volume changes. NVI increases when volume decreases, while PVI increases when volume increases.

#### NVI Calculation:
- If today's volume is less than the previous day's volume:
\[ \text{NVI}(i) = \text{NVI}(i-1) + \left( \frac{\text{Close}(i) - \text{Close}(i-1)}{\text{Close}(i-1)} \right) \times \text{NVI}(i-1) \]

#### PVI Calculation:
- If today's volume is greater than the previous day's volume:
\[ \text{PVI}(i) = \text{PVI}(i-1) + \left( \frac{\text{Close}(i) - \text{Close}(i-1)}{\text{Close}(i-1)} \right) \times \text{PVI}(i-1) \]

These indicators help identify trends and reversals based on volume activity.

### 8. Ease of Movement (EMV)

The Ease of Movement (EMV) indicator combines volume with price range to quantify the ease of price movement. It ranges from negative to positive values.

##### Calculation:
\[ \text{EMV} = \frac{ \frac{(\text{High} + \text{Low})}{2} - \frac{(\text{Previous High} + \text{Previous Low})}{2} }{\text{Volume}} \]

Higher EMV values indicate that the price is moving easily with relatively low volume, while lower EMV values indicate that it is harder for the price to move.

### 9. Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)

The Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) is a trading benchmark that calculates the average price a security has traded at throughout the day, based on both volume and price.

##### Calculation:
\[ \text{VWAP} = \frac{\sum{ \text{Typical Price} \times \text{Volume} }}{\sum{ \text{Volume} }} \]

where Typical Price is:
\[ \text{Typical Price} = \frac{\text{High} + \text{Low} + \text{Close}}{3} \]

VWAP helps traders discern the direction of the market trend and decide entry and exit points.

### 10. Coppock Curve Volume Indicator

The Coppock Curve is a momentum indicator originally created for stock markets but can be adapted for [volume analysis](../v/volume_analysis.md). It is used to identify long-term buying opportunities.

##### Calculation:
- Apply a 10-month weighted moving average (WMA) to the volume series.
- Compute a 14-period Rate of Change (ROC) on this WMA.
- Compute an 11-period Rate of Change on the result from the previous step.

# VA Loan

A VA [loan](../l/loan.md), also known as a Veterans Affairs [loan](../l/loan.md), is a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [loan](../l/loan.md) in the United States guaranteed by the [U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs](../u/u.s._department_of_veterans_affairs.md) (VA). This [loan](../l/loan.md) program was designed to [offer](../o/offer.md) long-term [financing](../f/financing.md) to eligible American veterans or their surviving spouses (provided they do not remarry). The VA [loan](../l/loan.md) is intended to provide an accessible and competitive [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) product for those who have served or are serving in the U.S. military, making it easier for them to become homeowners.

## History and Background

The VA [loan](../l/loan.md) program was established under the GI Bill of 1944, a piece of legislation that aimed to provide various benefits to veterans returning from World War II. The primary motivation behind this initiative was to help service members transition back to civilian life by providing avenues for education, employment, and homeownership. Over the decades, the program has undergone several changes and improvements but remains a key part of the benefits offered to U.S. military personnel.

## Eligibility Criteria

The VA [loan](../l/loan.md) is available to specific groups, including:

1. **Veterans**: Those who have served in the U.S. military and have been honorably discharged.
2. **Active-duty service members**: Those currently serving in the military.
3. **National Guard members and Reservists**: Typically after six years of service unless called to active duty.
4. **Surviving spouses**: Widows or widowers of service members who died in service or from a service-related disability, and who have not remarried.

Eligibility is determined through a Certificate of Eligibility (COE), which the borrower must obtain. This certificate outlines the borrower's entitlement amount, which is the portion of the [loan](../l/loan.md) that the VA [will](../w/will.md) guarantee.

## Key Features and Benefits

The VA [loan](../l/loan.md) offers several features and benefits that set it apart from [conventional mortgage](../c/conventional_mortgage.md) products:

- **No [Down Payment](../d/down_payment.md)**: One of the most significant advantages of a VA [loan](../l/loan.md) is the possibility of 100% [financing](../f/financing.md), meaning eligible borrowers can purchase a [home](../h/home.md) without a [down payment](../d/down_payment.md). This can significantly lower the barrier to homeownership.
- **No Private [Mortgage Insurance](../m/mortgage_insurance.md) (PMI)**: Unlike conventional loans, VA loans do not require PMI, even when the borrower does not make a [down payment](../d/down_payment.md). This can save borrowers a substantial amount over the life of the [loan](../l/loan.md).
- **Competitive [Interest](../i/interest.md) Rates**: VA loans often come with lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates compared to conventional loans, making monthly payments more affordable.
- **Flexible [Credit](../c/credit.md) Requirements**: While lenders still assess [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md), the VA's backing allows them to [offer](../o/offer.md) loans to borrowers who might not qualify for conventional [financing](../f/financing.md) due to lower [credit](../c/credit.md) scores.
- **Limited Closing Costs**: The VA limits the types and amounts of closing costs that veterans can be charged, which helps make the [home](../h/home.md)-buying process more affordable.
- **[Foreclosure](../f/foreclosure.md) Avoidance Advocacy**: The VA provides assistance and advocacy for borrowers who may be struggling with their [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) payments, helping to avoid [foreclosure](../f/foreclosure.md).

## Types of VA Loans

There are various types of VA loans available, depending on the borrower's needs:

1. **VA Purchase [Loan](../l/loan.md)**: Used to buy a new or existing [home](../h/home.md), with no [down payment](../d/down_payment.md) required as long as the sales price does not exceed the appraised [value](../v/value.md).
2. **VA [Refinance](../r/refinance.md) [Loan](../l/loan.md)**: [Options](../o/options.md) include the [Interest Rate](../i/interest_rate.md) Reduction [Refinance](../r/refinance.md) [Loan](../l/loan.md) (IRRRL), also known as the streamline [refinance](../r/refinance.md), which simplifies the process of refinancing an existing VA [loan](../l/loan.md) to obtain a lower [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md), and the [Cash-Out Refinance](../c/cash-out_refinance.md) [Loan](../l/loan.md), which allows borrowers to take out a new [loan](../l/loan.md) for more than they owe on their existing [loan](../l/loan.md) and receive the difference in cash.
3. **Native American Direct [Loan](../l/loan.md) (NADL)**: Available to eligible Native American veterans or their spouses to purchase, construct, or improve a [home](../h/home.md) on Federal [Trust](../t/trust.md) Land, or to [refinance](../r/refinance.md) an existing NADL to reduce the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md).
4. **Adapted Housing Grants**: Help veterans with service-connected disabilities to buy, build, or modify homes to suit their disabilities through Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) or Special Housing Adaptation (SHA) grants.

## VA Loan Funding Fee

To sustain the VA [loan](../l/loan.md) program, a funding [fee](../f/fee.md) is charged to the borrowers, which can be financed into the [loan](../l/loan.md) amount. The [fee](../f/fee.md) varies based on several factors, including the type of [loan](../l/loan.md), the borrower's military category, whether it's the borrower's first VA [loan](../l/loan.md), and the amount of the [down payment](../d/down_payment.md). The funding [fee](../f/fee.md) helps to [offset](../o/offset.md) the costs to taxpayers since the VA [loan](../l/loan.md) program doesn't require [mortgage insurance](../m/mortgage_insurance.md).

## Obtaining a VA Loan

The process of obtaining a VA [loan](../l/loan.md) generally follows these steps:

1. **Determine Eligibility**: Obtain the COE from the VA.
2. **Select a [Lender](../l/lender.md)**: Choose a VA-approved [lender](../l/lender.md) who [will](../w/will.md) process the [loan](../l/loan.md).
3. **Prequalification**: Discuss [income](../i/income.md), [credit](../c/credit.md), and [home](../h/home.md)-buying goals with the [lender](../l/lender.md).
4. **House Hunt**: Find a [home](../h/home.md) that meets VA property requirements.
5. **Sign a Purchase Agreement**: Once a house is chosen, sign a purchase agreement contingent on VA [appraisal](../a/appraisal.md) and satisfactory [loan](../l/loan.md) [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md).
6. **VA [Appraisal](../a/appraisal.md)**: Schedule a VA [appraisal](../a/appraisal.md) to ensure the [home](../h/home.md)'s [market value](../m/market_value.md) and condition meet the standards.
7. **[Loan](../l/loan.md) Processing and [Underwriting](../u/underwriting.md)**: The [lender](../l/lender.md) processes the [loan](../l/loan.md) and underwrites the application, ensuring all paperwork and criteria are met.
8. **Closing**: Finalize the [loan](../l/loan.md) and officially take ownership of the [home](../h/home.md).

## VA Loan Limits and Entitlement

The VA [loan](../l/loan.md) limit is the maximum amount the VA [will](../w/will.md) guarantee without a [down payment](../d/down_payment.md), which varies by county. As of 2020, the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act removed previous VA [loan](../l/loan.md) limits for full entitlement, allowing eligible veterans to borrow above the conforming [loan](../l/loan.md) limit if they have full entitlement and sufficient [income](../i/income.md).

*Full entitlement* is generally for those who have never used their benefit or have paid off a previous VA [loan](../l/loan.md) and have had their entitlement restored. For veterans with reduced entitlement due to current VA [loan](../l/loan.md) balances, the limits apply. 

## Refinancing with a VA Loan

Refinancing can be a strategic move for VA [loan](../l/loan.md) holders to reduce their [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) or cash out [equity](../e/equity.md):

- **[Interest Rate](../i/interest_rate.md) Reduction [Refinance](../r/refinance.md) [Loan](../l/loan.md) (IRRRL)**: Simplifies the process, typically requiring minimal documentation and no [appraisal](../a/appraisal.md) or [credit](../c/credit.md) [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md).
- **[Cash-Out Refinance](../c/cash-out_refinance.md) [Loan](../l/loan.md)**: Allows borrowers to replace their existing [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) with a new VA [loan](../l/loan.md) and take out cash from their [home equity](../h/home_equity.md) for [home](../h/home.md) improvements, [debt consolidation](../d/debt_consolidation.md), or other purposes. This option is available even if the existing [loan](../l/loan.md) is not a VA [loan](../l/loan.md).

## VA Loan Program Success and Impact

The VA [loan](../l/loan.md) program has proven enormously successful since its inception, helping millions of veterans achieve homeownership. The benefits offered by the program have made it an essential part of the [home](../h/home.md) buying process for eligible service members, providing opportunities that might otherwise be out of reach.

## Final Thoughts

The VA [loan](../l/loan.md) program remains a critical benefit for eligible veterans, service members, and their families, [offering](../o/offering.md) unique advantages that make homeownership more accessible and affordable. Understanding the eligibility criteria, benefits, and process is essential for those considering a VA [loan](../l/loan.md), and leveraging the program can lead to significant financial benefits and stability.

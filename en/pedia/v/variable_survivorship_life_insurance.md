# Variable Survivorship Life Insurance

Variable survivorship [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md), also known as second-to-die [variable life insurance](../v/variable_life_insurance.md), is a form of [permanent life insurance](../p/permanent_life_insurance.md) policy that covers two individuals, typically spouses. The [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) is only paid out after both individuals have passed away. This [insurance](../i/insurance.md) product combines the features of survivorship [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) and [variable life insurance](../v/variable_life_insurance.md), providing not only lifetime coverage but also investment opportunities that can potentially grow in [value](../v/value.md) over time.

## Key Features

### Dual Coverage and Payout

Variable survivorship [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) is designed to insure two people under one policy. The notable feature is that the [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) is not disbursed until the second insured individual dies. This makes it a strategic choice for [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md) and [wealth](../w/wealth.md) transfer.

### Investment Component

Like other variable life insurances, policyholders can invest the premiums into various sub-accounts, which function similarly to mutual funds. These sub-accounts can include [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, and [money market](../m/money_market.md) instruments, allowing the cash [value](../v/value.md) of the policy to grow based on the performance of these investments.

### Flexibility

This type of policy offers considerable flexibility in terms of [premium](../p/premium.md) payments and death benefits. Policyholders can usually adjust their [premium](../p/premium.md) payments and [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) as their financial situation or goals change.

### Tax Advantages

Death benefits from [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policies are generally [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md) to beneficiaries, and the cash [value](../v/value.md) accumulation grows on a [tax-deferred](../t/tax_deferred.md) [basis](../b/basis.md). This makes it an efficient vehicle for [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md) and [wealth](../w/wealth.md) transfer.

## Advantages

### Lower Premiums

Since the [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) is only paid out after both insured individuals have passed away, premiums tend to be lower compared to individual policies providing the same total coverage.

### Estate Planning Benefits

This kind of policy is often used in [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md) to cover [estate](../e/estate.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) or to provide a significant inheritance for beneficiaries. Because the [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) is delayed until the second death, it can be optimally timed to meet [estate](../e/estate.md) settlement needs.

### Investment Growth Potential

With access to a variety of investment [options](../o/options.md), the cash [value](../v/value.md) component of the policy offers the potential for significant growth over time. This can help in accumulating a larger amount for beneficiaries or for policy loans and withdrawals during the policyholders' lifetimes.

### Loan and Withdrawal Choices

Policyholders have the option to take loans or withdrawals from the cash [value](../v/value.md) of the policy, which can provide financial flexibility in times of need.

## Disadvantages

### Investment Risk

The cash [value](../v/value.md) in the policy is subject to [market](../m/market.md) risks. Poor investment performance can lead to reduced cash [value](../v/value.md) and possibly higher premiums to maintain the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) coverage.

### Complexity

Variable survivorship [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policies are more complex compared to term or [whole life insurance](../w/whole_life_insurance.md). Managing the investment component requires a good understanding of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and investment principles.

### No Immediate Death Benefit

Since the [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) is not paid until the second insured's death, the policy does not provide financial support upon the first insured's death. This might be a drawback for families needing immediate funds after the first death.

### Policy Management

Regular monitoring and possibly adjusting the investment allocations within the policy require effort and knowledge. Policyholders might need advisory services, adding to the cost of maintaining the policy.

## Customization Options

### Riders

Riders are additional provisions that can be added to a [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policy to provide extra benefits or protection. Common riders in variable survivorship [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) include:

- **Waiver of [Premium](../p/premium.md)**: In case of disability or critical illness, premiums can be waived without affecting the coverage.
- **Guaranteed Insurability**: Allows the purchase of additional coverage at predetermined intervals without undergoing new medical examinations.
- **Long-Term Care**: Provides for long-term care expenses which can substantially reduce the [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md).

### Investment Options

Most policies [offer](../o/offer.md) a wide [range](../r/range.md) of sub-accounts, allowing policyholders to diversify their investments across various [asset](../a/asset.md) classes. Regular reviews and adjustments can optimize the growth of the cash [value](../v/value.md).

### Death Benefit Options

Policyholders can choose between a level [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md), which remains the same over time, or an increasing [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md), where the [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) may increase based on the performance of the investment component or by a predetermined amount.

## Use Cases

### Estate Tax Planning

One of the primary uses of variable survivorship [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) is to efficiently cover federal and state [estate](../e/estate.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md), ensuring that heirs are not forced to [liquidate](../l/liquidate.md) assets. The delayed [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) [payout](../p/payout.md) aligns well with the timing of [estate tax](../e/estate_tax.md) liabilities.

### Special Needs Children

Families with special needs dependents often use this policy to ensure long-term financial [security](../s/security.md) for their dependents. Since the [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) is only paid after the second parent's death, it guarantees prolonged support.

### Pension Maximization

For retirees with pension plans, this policy can [offer](../o/offer.md) a strategic advantage. By electing a higher pension [payout](../p/payout.md) that is typically reserved for single-life payouts, retirees can use a portion of this higher [income](../i/income.md) to [fund](../f/fund.md) a variable survivorship [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policy, ensuring their spouse [will](../w/will.md) still receive financial support after their death.

## Considerations Before Purchase

### Financial Objectives

Determining the primary financial objectives, such as [estate](../e/estate.md) [tax planning](../t/tax_planning.md), [wealth](../w/wealth.md) transfer, or long-term care funding, is crucial. This [will](../w/will.md) help in deciding whether variable survivorship [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) aligns with the overall [financial plan](../f/financial_plan.md).

### Comfort with Investment Risk

Understanding one's [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) is important as the investment component of the policy can lead to fluctuating cash values. Those less comfortable with investment risks might opt for more conservative investment [options](../o/options.md) within the policy.

### Health and Age

The collective health and age of the insured individuals [will](../w/will.md) influence the [premium](../p/premium.md) costs. Generally, healthier and younger individuals might benefit from more favorable [premium](../p/premium.md) rates.

### Consultation with Financial Advisors

Due to the complexity of this product, consulting with financial advisors who specialize in [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) and [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md) can provide valuable insights and ensure that the policy choice aligns with the financial goals.

# VWAP Cross

The VWAP Cross is a [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) and [indicator](../i/indicator.md) that is centered around the [Volume](../v/volume.md)-[Weighted Average](../w/weighted_average.md) Price (VWAP), a crucial concept in trading and [finance](../f/finance.md). VWAP is a trading [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) used predominantly by institutional traders to provide a fair assessment of price [value](../v/value.md) throughout the trading day. The VWAP Cross strategy leverages this [indicator](../i/indicator.md) to make buy and sell decisions, particularly focusing on [price action](../p/price_action.md) as it crosses above or below the VWAP line.

## Understanding VWAP

The [Volume](../v/volume.md)-[Weighted Average](../w/weighted_average.md) Price (VWAP) is an average price a [security](../s/security.md) has traded at throughout the day, based on both [volume](../v/volume.md) and price. More formally, VWAP is calculated using the following formula:

\[ \text{VWAP} = \frac{\sum (\text{Price} \times \text{[Volume](../v/volume.md)})}{\sum \text{[Volume](../v/volume.md)}} \]

Where:
- **Price** is the price of the [trade](../t/trade.md).
- **[Volume](../v/volume.md)** is the [volume](../v/volume.md) of the [trade](../t/trade.md).

VWAP helps in comparing the current price to the average price experienced during a [trading session](../t/trading_session.md). It is useful for both analysts and traders who might use this as a reference for trading decisions.

## Application of VWAP in Trading

VWAP is employed mainly for [short-term trading](../s/short-term_trading.md) tactics but has [value](../v/value.md) in long-term strategies as well. In [intraday trading](../i/intraday_trading.md), VWAP acts as a critical marker for [trader](../t/trader.md) behavior:

1. **Institutional Traders**: They often use VWAP to ensure they are executing trades near the average [market price](../m/market_price.md) to ensure efficient pricing.
2. **Algo Trading**: VWAP algorithms help in minimizing [market](../m/market.md) impact and [slippage](../s/slippage.md), executing trades at [multiple](../m/multiple.md) times across the [trading session](../t/trading_session.md) to achieve VWAP prices.

## VWAP Cross Strategy

VWAP Cross is a relatively straightforward [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) that relies on the crossing of [price action](../p/price_action.md) above or below the VWAP line. By following these crossings, traders can identify potential trends and [trade](../t/trade.md) accordingly:

1. **Bullish Bias**: When the price crosses above the VWAP, it indicates a bullish [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md). In such conditions:
    - Traders may enter long positions.
    - It suggests that buyers are willing to pay prices above the average price of the day, indicating strength.

2. **Bearish Bias**: When the price crosses below the VWAP, it indicates bearish sentiment. In this scenario:
    - Traders may enter short positions.
    - It implies that the [market](../m/market.md) is experiencing selling pressure, dragging prices below the average [transaction](../t/transaction.md) price of the day.

### Execution of VWAP Cross Strategy

#### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Calculate VWAP**: First, calculate the VWAP for the [security](../s/security.md) for the desired time frameâ€”typically one trading day.
2. **Set Entry Points**: Identify conditions for entry points:
    - **Long Entry**: When the price crosses above the VWAP.
    - **Short Entry**: When the price crosses below the VWAP.
3. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Set [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md) just below the VWAP for long positions and just above for short positions to manage risks.
4. **Exit Points**: Determine exit strategies. One method could be setting target prices or using trailing stops.

#### Example:

Consider a stock XYZ trading intraday. Initially, the price is below the VWAP. If at some point during the day, the price crosses above the VWAP, a [trader](../t/trader.md) might:
- Initiate a long position.
- Place a [stop-loss order](../s/stop-loss_order.md) below the VWAP to mitigate [risk](../r/risk.md).
- Set a [profit](../p/profit.md) target or use a [trailing stop](../t/trailing_stop.md) to capture gains.

Conversely, if XYZ stock's price falls below the VWAP, the [trader](../t/trader.md) might:
- Initiate a short position.
- Place a [stop-loss order](../s/stop-loss_order.md) above the VWAP.
- Set target exit points accordingly.

## Advanced Techniques and Considerations

### Multi-Time Frame Analysis

For increased reliability, some traders incorporate multi-time frame VWAP analysis. They might simultaneously observe VWAP on different time frames such as 1-minute, 5-minute, and daily charts. This multi-time perspective helps in understanding the broader [trend](../t/trend.md) and aligning short-term trades with long-term sentiment.

### VWAP Bands

Similar to [Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_band.md), VWAP bands add a [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) component to the standard VWAP line, creating upper and lower bands. These bands can act as dynamic [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels:
- **Upper Band**: Consider this as a resistance level where price might reverse.
- **Lower Band**: Consider this as a support level where price might bounce back.

### Implementing VWAP in Algorithmic Trading

In the realm of [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), VWAP is highly significant. Algorithms aren't just using VWAP as a reference point; they are designed to execute trades that aim to achieve VWAP or better:

1. **VWAP Targeting Algorithms**: These algos break down large orders into smaller parts distributed throughout the trading day to achieve the VWAP price.
2. **Cost-Reduction Strategies**: Algorithms use VWAP as part of larger strategies to reduce [market](../m/market.md) impact and [slippage](../s/slippage.md), ensuring large orders do not adversely affect the [security](../s/security.md)'s price.

### Integration in Trading Platforms

Several trading platforms and financial data providers have built-in functionality to compute VWAP. Notable platforms include:
- **[Bloomberg Terminal](../b/bloomberg_terminal.md)**: Used by professionals, offers comprehensive features to analyze and use VWAP for various financial instruments.
- **[TradingView](../t/tradingview.md)**: Provides VWAP as a built-in [indicator](../i/indicator.md) accessible within charts for easy analysis.

### Challenges and Limitations

While VWAP and VWAP Cross can be powerful for trading:
1. **Lag in Data**: VWAP is a [lagging indicator](../l/lagging_indicator.md), reflecting past data. Rapid price changes might not be immediately noticeable.
2. **[Market](../m/market.md) Conditions**: VWAP might be less effective in highly volatile or low-[volume](../v/volume.md) markets where trades are sparse or sporadic.
3. **[False Signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md)**: Like any technical tool, the VWAP Cross can produce [false signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md), emphasizing the need for additional confirmatory indicators.

## Conclusion

The VWAP Cross strategy combines the power of the [Volume](../v/volume.md)-[Weighted Average](../w/weighted_average.md) Price with cross-over techniques to potentially identify trading opportunities. By understanding how VWAP operates and integrating it effectively with [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) and trading [execution](../e/execution.md), traders can [leverage](../l/leverage.md) this strategy both manually and algorithmically. Institutions and individual traders alike find VWAP indispensable for achieving fair prices, enhancing [trading performance](../t/trading_performance.md), and minimizing costs.

# Volumetric Production Payment (VPP)

A Volumetric Production [Payment](../p/payment.md) (VPP) represents a buyer's right to a percentage of production [volume](../v/volume.md) from a specific oil or gas property, free and clear of operating expenses and development costs. VPPs are unique financial instruments used predominantly in the [energy sector](../e/energy_sector.md), particularly in the oil and gas [industry](../i/industry.md). They stand as a method for companies to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) without incurring [debt](../d/debt.md) or diluting [equity](../e/equity.md). This detailed overview [will](../w/will.md) explicate various aspects of VPPs, including their mechanics, advantages, disadvantages, [accounting](../a/accounting.md) implications, legal considerations, transactional structures, historical context, and usage within modern [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

## Mechanics of Volumetric Production Payment

### Structure

A VPP is a predefined quantity of hydrocarbons that is sold upfront in [exchange](../e/exchange.md) for a [lump-sum payment](../l/lump-sum_payment.md). The purchaser of the VPP obtains the right to a specified percentage of the production from a particular [asset](../a/asset.md) until the agreed-upon [volume](../v/volume.md) is delivered. The seller, typically an oil and gas producer, commits to delivering these volumes over time.

### Payment and Delivery

1. **Upfront [Payment](../p/payment.md)**: The purchaser provides the seller with a [lump-sum payment](../l/lump-sum_payment.md) at the onset of the agreement. This [payment](../p/payment.md) is [capital](../c/capital.md) and not treated as a [loan](../l/loan.md).
2. **Delivery [Obligations](../o/obligation.md)**: The seller delivers the designated [hydrocarbon](../h/hydrocarbon.md) volumes over time. Unlike traditional loans, there are no periodic [interest](../i/interest.md) payments. The [volume](../v/volume.md) delivery is the sole obligation.
3. **Quality and Quantity**: The agreement usually specifies the quality of hydrocarbons. The seller must ensure the delivered product meets agreed standards.

### Free and Clear of Costs

One of the appealing aspects of VPPs for buyers is that they are generally free from any operating and development costs. The seller bears the responsibility for any production and operational costs, ensuring that the delivered volumes meet the agreement terms without passing these expenses onto the VPP holder.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### For Sellers

**Advantages:**

1. **Non-Dilutive [Capital](../c/capital.md)**: Sellers can obtain immediate [capital](../c/capital.md) without diluting [equity](../e/equity.md) or increasing [debt](../d/debt.md) levels.
2. **[Balance Sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) Implications**: Unlike traditional loans, VPPs do not appear as [long-term liabilities](../l/long-term_liabilities.md). This can be particularly attractive for maintaining [financial ratios](../f/financial_ratios.md).
3. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Sellers can [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against production and price [volatility](../v/volatility.md) by selling a future production stream.

**Disadvantages:**

1. **Reduced Future [Revenue](../r/revenue.md)**: Committing a portion of future production can result in reduced [revenue](../r/revenue.md) streams once the hydrocarbons are produced.
2. **[Volume](../v/volume.md) [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: The obligation to deliver specified volumes regardless of future production capabilities can pose a [risk](../r/risk.md) if production underperforms.

### For Buyers

**Advantages:**

1. **Stable Returns**: VPPs typically provide predictable, stable returns not affected by operational cost [variability](../v/variability.md).
2. **Exposure to [Commodity](../c/commodity.md) Prices**: Buyers [gain](../g/gain.md) exposure to commodities, potentially benefiting from price appreciations.
3. **Secured Investment**: VPP agreements often include safeguard provisions that prioritize buyer payments before other [obligations](../o/obligation.md).

**Disadvantages:**

1. **Production [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: Buyers face the [risk](../r/risk.md) of underperformance or non-delivery if the seller's production is impacted.
2. **Price [Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: Although insulated from operational costs, buyers still face [market price](../m/market_price.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) for delivered volumes.

## Accounting Implications

### For Sellers

1. **[Revenue Recognition](../r/revenue_recognition.md)**: The upfront [payment](../p/payment.md) is usually treated as [deferred revenue](../d/deferred_revenue.md) and recognized as production occurs.
2. **[Asset](../a/asset.md) and [Liability](../l/liability.md) Management**: The physical reserves associated with the VPP are reclassified accordingly, but no [liability](../l/liability.md) is recorded as it is not a [loan](../l/loan.md).

### For Buyers

1. **Investment [Accounting](../a/accounting.md)**: The purchaser records the upfront [payment](../p/payment.md) as a [capital investment](../c/capital_investment.md).
2. **[Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Reporting**: As the [commodity](../c/commodity.md) is delivered, the purchaser recognizes it as [inventory](../i/inventory.md) or directly as sales [revenue](../r/revenue.md) after fulfilling any necessary processing.

## Legal Considerations

### Contractual Terms

The legality of VPP contracts necessitates clear documentation, ensuring both parties' [obligations](../o/obligation.md), rights, and remedies are well defined. Important terms include:

1. **[Volume](../v/volume.md) Guarantees**: Define the total [volume](../v/volume.md) and delivery schedule.
2. **Quality Specifications**: Establish the acceptable [range](../r/range.md) for [hydrocarbon](../h/hydrocarbon.md) quality.
3. **Operational Control**: Outline the seller's responsibility for managing and maintaining production.

### Risk Mitigation Clauses

1. **[Force Majeure](../f/force_majeure.md)**: Protects parties from liabilities due to events beyond control, such as natural disasters or regulatory changes.
2. **Make-Up Provisions**: Allow sellers to make up for deficient volumes within specified periods.
3. **[Default](../d/default.md) Remedies**: Detail the course of action in case of [default](../d/default.md), ensuring the buyerâ€™s rights to recoup potential losses.

## Transactional Structures

VPP contracts can be structured in various ways to meet the needs of both parties:

1. **Traditional VPP**: The buyer receives a fixed [volume](../v/volume.md) percentage from specific wells.
2. **Hybrid VPP**: Combines volumetric [payment](../p/payment.md) with other financial instruments like [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) for additional [risk management](../r/risk_management.md).
3. **Securitized VPP**: Aggregates [multiple](../m/multiple.md) VPPs as part of securitized products to diversify [risk](../r/risk.md) and attract institutional investors.

## Historical Context

VPPs have been an instrumental part of the oil and gas [industry](../i/industry.md) for decades. They gained prominence in the 1980s as energy companies sought new [financing](../f/financing.md) methods amid volatile markets. The early adopters were primarily independent producers in the U.S. shale oil revolution. Over the years, major players such as Chevron and ExxonMobil have employed VPPs to manage [capital](../c/capital.md) and operational risks effectively.

## Modern Financial Markets

In today's financial landscape, VPPs have found a niche beyond traditional oil and gas operations:

1. **Renewable [Energy Sector](../e/energy_sector.md)**: Similar concepts are being adapted for renewable projects like wind and solar, providing upfront [financing](../f/financing.md) against future energy output.
2. **Corporate [Financing](../f/financing.md)**: Companies in other industries are exploring VPP-like structures to manage future [revenue](../r/revenue.md) streams from long-term contracts.
3. **Investment Products**: VPPs are included in diversified portfolios to provide stable, [commodity](../c/commodity.md)-linked returns.

### Companies Utilizing VPPs

For example, you can find more information about current users of VPPs within larger financial entities and energy companies. Companies such as **Chesapeake Energy** ([link](https://www.chk.com/)) and **ExxonMobil** ([link](https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/)) are notable for their involvement in VPP transactions.

## Conclusion

Volumetric Production Payments represent a sophisticated [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) allowing producers and investors to meet specific [capital](../c/capital.md) and operational needs. While primarily rooted in the oil and gas [industry](../i/industry.md), their principles are adaptable across various sectors, illustrating their versatile nature as financial tools. As the [market](../m/market.md) evolves, VPPs continue to be valuable for strategic [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md), providing both stability and opportunity in dynamic environments.

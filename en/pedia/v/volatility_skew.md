# Volatility Skew

[Volatility](../v/volatility.md) skew refers to the pattern in which implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md) (IV) varies with respect to the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) and expiration of [options](../o/options.md). This concept is a critical aspect of [options](../o/options.md) trading and is closely watched by traders as it reveals information about [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md), expectations, and hedging activities. Understanding [volatility](../v/volatility.md) skew can aid in more accurate pricing of [options](../o/options.md) and improved [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) strategies.

### Types of Volatility Skew

**1. Vertical Skew (Strike Skew):**  
Vertical skew refers to the variation in implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md) across different strike prices for [options](../o/options.md) with the same expiration. When plotted on a graph with strike prices on the x-axis and implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md) on the y-axis, the shape of this curve is called the [volatility smile](../v/volatility_smile.md) or [volatility](../v/volatility.md) smirk.

- **[Volatility Smile](../v/volatility_smile.md):** This pattern occurs when lower and higher strike prices exhibit higher implied volatilities compared to at-the-[money](../m/money.md) (ATM) [options](../o/options.md). It often indicates higher [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) or [demand](../d/demand.md) for hedging at extreme price levels.
  
- **[Volatility](../v/volatility.md) Smirk:** Typically, [equity options](../e/equity_options.md) exhibit higher implied volatilities for out-of-the-[money](../m/money.md) (OTM) [put options](../p/put_options.md) than for OTM call [options](../o/options.md). This pattern, called a [volatility](../v/volatility.md) smirk or skew, indicates a higher [premium](../p/premium.md) for [put options](../p/put_options.md) as a [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against a potential [market](../m/market.md) downturn.
  
**2. Horizontal Skew (Term Structure):**  
Horizontal skew refers to the change in implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md) for [options](../o/options.md) with the same [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) but different expiration dates. This skew is also known as the term structure of [volatility](../v/volatility.md). Generally, the term structure is upward sloping, implying that longer-term [options](../o/options.md) have higher implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md) due to the greater [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) over a longer [time horizon](../t/time_horizon.md).

### Factors Influencing Volatility Skew

Several factors can influence the shape and dynamics of [volatility](../v/volatility.md) skew:

- **[Market Sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md):**  
  Traders' expectations of future [market](../m/market.md) movements can cause asymmetries in implied volatilities. For instance, if a [market](../m/market.md) downturn is anticipated, the [demand](../d/demand.md) for protective puts [will](../w/will.md) increase, raising their implied volatilities.

- **[Supply](../s/supply.md) and [Demand](../d/demand.md) Imbalances:**  
  Higher [demand](../d/demand.md) for specific [options](../o/options.md) (e.g., OTM puts for hedging purposes) can drive up their premiums, thus affecting implied volatilities.

- **[Historical Volatility](../h/historical_volatility.md) Trends:**  
  Historical movements in [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets can impact the perceived [risk](../r/risk.md), leading to changes in implied volatilities.

- **Event Risks:**  
  Scheduled events like [earnings](../e/earnings.md) reports, economic data releases, or geopolitical developments can cause short-term distortions in [volatility](../v/volatility.md) skew.

### Practical Applications

- **[Options](../o/options.md) Pricing:**  
  Accurate calculation of [options](../o/options.md) prices requires the appropriate use of implied volatilities. Understanding skew helps traders better estimate the [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) of [options](../o/options.md).

- **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md):**  
  By analyzing [volatility](../v/volatility.md) skew, traders can gauge [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) and potential price moves, enabling more effective [hedging strategies](../h/hedging_strategies.md).

- **[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) Opportunities:**  
  Discrepancies in implied volatilities across different strikes or maturities can present [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) opportunities. Traders can exploit these differences through strategies like calendar [spreads](../s/spreads.md) or vertical [spreads](../s/spreads.md).

### Key Models and Theories

**1. [Black-Scholes Model](../b/black-scholes_model.md):**  
The [Black-Scholes model](../b/black-scholes_model.md) assumes constant [volatility](../v/volatility.md), which doesn't account for [volatility](../v/volatility.md) skew. Nevertheless, it's a foundational model for understanding basic [options](../o/options.md) pricing.

**2. Local [Volatility Models](../v/volatility_models.md):**  
These models extend the Black-Scholes framework by allowing [volatility](../v/volatility.md) to vary with both the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) and time. One common approach is the Dupire Local [Volatility](../v/volatility.md) Model.

- **Dupire Model:**  
  This model derives local [volatility](../v/volatility.md) surfaces from [market](../m/market.md) prices of [European options](../e/european_options.md) and their implied volatilities. It captures the dynamic nature of [volatility](../v/volatility.md) skew more effectively than the [Black-Scholes model](../b/black-scholes_model.md).

**3. [Stochastic Volatility Models](../s/stochastic_volatility_models.md):**  
[Stochastic volatility models](../s/stochastic_volatility_models.md), such as the [Heston model](../h/heston_model.md), incorporate [volatility](../v/volatility.md) as a random process that evolves over time. These models provide a more realistic depiction of [market](../m/market.md) behaviors by allowing [volatility](../v/volatility.md) to vary stochastically.

- **[Heston Model](../h/heston_model.md):**  
  This model assumes that the variance of an [asset](../a/asset.md) follows a mean-reverting stochastic process, allowing for more flexible and accurate modeling of [volatility](../v/volatility.md) skew.

### Real-World Examples

**1. [Equity Options](../e/equity_options.md):**  
  Implied volatilities for [equity options](../e/equity_options.md) often exhibit a pronounced smirk. For example, consider the S&P 500 [Index options](../i/index_options.md), where [put options](../p/put_options.md) tend to have higher implied volatilities compared to call [options](../o/options.md) at similar out-of-the-[money](../m/money.md) distances. This pattern suggests investors are consistently seeking protection against potential [market](../m/market.md) declines.

**2. [Commodity Options](../c/commodity_options.md):**  
  [Volatility](../v/volatility.md) skew in [commodity](../c/commodity.md) markets can be influenced by factors such as [supply](../s/supply.md) constraints, geopolitical risks, and seasonal variations. For instance, [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md) [options](../o/options.md) may show higher implied volatilities for out-of-the-[money](../m/money.md) calls due to potential [supply](../s/supply.md) shocks or [geopolitical events](../g/geopolitical_events.md) affecting oil prices.

**3. FX [Options](../o/options.md):**  
  [Currency](../c/currency.md) [options](../o/options.md) often display different skew patterns compared to [equity options](../e/equity_options.md). The skew can reflect economic and political uncertainties, [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) differentials, and central [bank](../b/bank.md) policies. For example, [options](../o/options.md) on emerging [market](../m/market.md) currencies might show substantial skews due to higher economic and political risks.

### Conclusion

[Volatility](../v/volatility.md) skew is an essential concept in [options](../o/options.md) trading, providing valuable insights into [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md), potential price movements, and hedging activities. By understanding and analyzing [volatility](../v/volatility.md) skew, traders can enhance their pricing accuracy, develop effective [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) strategies, and identify potential [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) opportunities. The interplay of [market](../m/market.md) forces, [supply](../s/supply.md)-[demand](../d/demand.md) dynamics, and event risks ensures that [volatility](../v/volatility.md) skew remains a constantly evolving aspect of the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

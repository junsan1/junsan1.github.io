# Variable Annuity

A variable annuity is a type of annuity contract that allows for investment in various subaccounts, which are similar to mutual funds. These subaccounts are managed to maximize returns, and the performance of the annuity depends on the results of these investment [options](../o/options.md). Unlike fixed annuities, where the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) company assumes the investment [risk](../r/risk.md), in variable annuities, the contract holder bears this [risk](../r/risk.md), which can potentially lead to higher returns.

## Key Features of Variable Annuities

### Investment Options

Variable annuities [offer](../o/offer.md) a [range](../r/range.md) of investment [options](../o/options.md), often referred to as subaccounts, allowing investors to allocate their funds across different [asset](../a/asset.md) classes such as equities, bonds, and [money market](../m/money_market.md) instruments. These subaccounts are managed by professional investment managers and can vary significantly both in terms of [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) and [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Tax Benefits

One of the primary attractions of variable annuities is their [tax-deferred](../t/tax_deferred.md) growth. [Earnings](../e/earnings.md) within the annuity compound [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md) until they are withdrawn, allowing investments to potentially grow more rapidly than in a taxable account. Withdrawals, however, may be subject to [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md) tax and may incur penalties if taken before age 59½.

### Flexibility of Payout Options

Variable annuities can [offer](../o/offer.md) several types of [payout](../p/payout.md) [options](../o/options.md) to the contract holder, including:
- **Lifetime payments:** Guaranteeing payments for the remainder of the [annuitant](../a/annuitant.md)'s life.
- **Period certain payments:** Specifying a set period during which payments [will](../w/will.md) be made.
- **[Joint](../j/joint.md) and survivor payments:** Continuing payments for the life of the [annuitant](../a/annuitant.md) and their [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md).

### Death Benefits and Living Benefits

Most variable annuities come with built-in death benefits, ensuring that beneficiaries receive a guaranteed amount regardless of the annuity’s performance. These death benefits can include:
- **[Return](../r/return.md) of [Premium](../p/premium.md):** Guaranteeing the [return](../r/return.md) of initial investment minus any withdrawals.
- **Stepped-up [Death Benefit](../d/death_benefit.md):** Locking in gains periodically, providing beneficiaries with the higher of the account [value](../v/value.md) or the stepped-up amount.

Additionally, some variable annuities [offer](../o/offer.md) living benefits such as Guaranteed Minimum [Income](../i/income.md) Benefits (GMIBs), Guaranteed Minimum Accumulation Benefits (GMABs), and Guaranteed Minimum [Withdrawal Benefits](../w/withdrawal_benefits.md) (GMWBs), providing various levels of [income](../i/income.md) or [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) guarantees regardless of [market](../m/market.md) performance.

### Riders and Additional Features

Investors can often add optional features, known as riders, to their variable annuity contracts to customize and enhance their benefits. Common riders include long-term care riders, enhanced death benefits, and additional living benefits riders. While these can provide significant additional benefits, they often come with extra costs.

## Risks and Considerations

### Market Risk

Since variable annuities invest in subaccounts tied to various [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), they are subject to [market risk](../m/market_risk.md). The [value](../v/value.md) of the subaccounts can fluctuate based on [market](../m/market.md) performance, and there is no guarantee of [principal](../p/principal.md) [repayment](../r/repayment.md).

### Fees and Expenses

Variable annuities typically come with a [range](../r/range.md) of fees and expenses that can impact overall returns. These may include:
- **Mortality and [Expense](../e/expense.md) [Risk](../r/risk.md) Charges (M&E fees):** Compensating the insurer for [insurance](../i/insurance.md) risks and [administrative expenses](../a/administrative_expenses.md).
- **Administrative Fees:** Covering record-keeping and other administrative costs.
- **[Investment Management](../i/investment_management.md) Fees:** Associated with managing the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) subaccounts.
- **[Rider](../r/rider.md) Fees:** Additional costs for optional riders and add-ons.

### Surrender Charges

Variable annuities often come with surrender charges if funds are withdrawn within a specified period after the initial investment. These charges can be a percentage of the amount withdrawn and typically decrease over time.

### Complexity

Variable annuities can be complex financial products with various features, [options](../o/options.md), and associated fees. Investors should thoroughly understand the terms and conditions of their annuity contract and consider the annuity’s fit within their broader [financial plan](../f/financial_plan.md).

## Suitability and the Role of Advisers

Variable annuities may be suitable for investors who are looking for [tax-deferred](../t/tax_deferred.md) growth, the potential for higher returns through [market](../m/market.md) participation, and the [security](../s/security.md) of death benefits or living benefits. They can be particularly appropriate for those planning for retirement, seeking to balance growth with a level of [security](../s/security.md), and willing to assume [market risk](../m/market_risk.md).

It is critical for potential investors to work with financial advisers who can provide [guidance](../g/guidance.md) on the suitability of a variable annuity in relation to their financial goals, [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md), and [investment horizon](../i/investment_horizon.md). Advisers can help assess the pros and cons of different annuity contracts and explain the intricate details of fees, benefits, and payouts.

## Conclusion

Variable annuities [offer](../o/offer.md) a unique blend of investment and [insurance](../i/insurance.md) features, providing the benefits of [tax-deferred](../t/tax_deferred.md) growth, diverse investment choices, and customizable [options](../o/options.md) for [income](../i/income.md) and protection. However, they also carry risks and complexities that necessitate careful consideration and understanding. By leveraging the expertise of financial professionals, investors can make informed decisions about incorporating variable annuities into their overall financial strategy.

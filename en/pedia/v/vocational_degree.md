# Vocational Degree

A vocational degree, also known as a career or technical degree, is a type of educational certification focused on equipping students with specialized skills and practical experience particularly suited for specific industries or trades. Unlike traditional academic degrees, vocational degrees prioritize hands-on learning, industry-specific training, and real-world applications. In this detailed exploration, we will dissect the various aspects of vocational degrees, including their benefits, types, industries they cater to, and their role in the modern educational landscape.

## Definition and Overview

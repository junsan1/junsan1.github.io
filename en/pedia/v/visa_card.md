## Types of Visa Cards

Visa cards come in different types based on their functionalities and the needs they cater to:

### 1. Visa Credit Card

Visa credit cards allow users to borrow money from the issuer to make purchases or withdraw cash and then repay the borrowed amount along with interest and any applicable fees.

### 2. Visa Debit Card

Visa debit cards enable users to access funds directly from their bank accounts. They offer the convenience of electronic payments without the need for borrowing money.

### 3. Visa Prepaid Card

Visa prepaid cards are preloaded with a specific amount of money. Once the funds are depleted, the card can either be discarded or reloaded, depending on the type of prepaid card.

## How Visa Cards Work

Visa cards operate through an intricate process involving various parties, including the cardholder, merchant, acquiring bank, issuing bank, and Visa network. Here's a general overview of how a Visa card transaction works:

1. **Authorization**: The cardholder presents their Visa card for payment. The merchant's terminal sends the transaction details to the acquiring bank, which then forwards them to the Visa network.
2. **Authentication & Approval**: Visa sends the transaction request to the issuing bank for authentication. If the cardholder has sufficient funds or credit, the issuing bank approves the transaction.
3. **Settlement**: Once authorized, the transaction is settled. The issuing bank transfers funds to the acquiring bank through the Visa network.
4. **Reconciliation**: The acquiring bank credits the merchant's account for the transaction amount, minus any processing fees.

## Security Features

Visa cards incorporate various security features to protect against fraud and unauthorized use:

### 1. EMV Chip

EMV (Europay, MasterCard, and Visa) chips provide enhanced security compared to traditional magnetic stripe cards. They generate a unique transaction code for each payment, making it difficult for fraudsters to duplicate.

### 2. Visa Secure

Visa Secure, formerly known as Verified by Visa, adds an extra layer of protection for online transactions. Cardholders are required to verify their identity through additional authentication steps.

### 3. Contactless Payments

Visa contactless cards allow for quick and secure payments by simply tapping the card on a contactless-enabled terminal. These payments use encryption to safeguard card information.

### 4. Zero Liability Policy

Visa's Zero Liability Policy protects cardholders from unauthorized transactions. If fraudulent activity is detected, cardholders are not held responsible for the unauthorized charges.

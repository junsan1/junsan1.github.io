# Value Line Composite Index

The **[Value](../v/value.md) Line Composite [Index](../i/index.md)** is a stock [market index](../m/market_index.md) consisting of around 1,700 publicly traded companies from the NYSE, AMEX, [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md), and over-the-counter markets. Created by [Value](../v/value.md) Line, Inc., the [index](../i/index.md) aims to [offer](../o/offer.md) a more inclusive representation of the broader [market](../m/market.md) compared to indices focused only on [large-cap stocks](../l/large_cap_stocks.md). This [index](../i/index.md) is less reliant on [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) and instead focuses on an equally-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) model, which means each stock in the [index](../i/index.md) is given an [equal weight](../e/equal_weight.md) regardless of its [market](../m/market.md) size.

## Structure and Methodology

The [Value](../v/value.md) Line Composite [Index](../i/index.md) is unique in its equally-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) structure. This methodology contrasts with [market](../m/market.md)-cap-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) indices like the S&P 500, where companies with larger [market](../m/market.md) caps have a greater influence on the [index](../i/index.md)'s performance. In an equally-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) [index](../i/index.md), every stock contributes equally, regardless of its [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md).

### Calculation

The [index](../i/index.md) can be calculated using two primary methods:
1. **[Arithmetic Mean](../a/arithmetic_mean.md)**: An average of the daily percentage price changes of all [stocks](../s/stock.md).
2. **[Geometric Mean](../g/geometric_mean_in_trading.md)**: An average that takes the product of a set of numbers and then takes the nth root (where n is the total number of values). 

In practice, the [Value](../v/value.md) Line Composite [Index](../i/index.md) uses the [arithmetic mean](../a/arithmetic_mean.md) for simplicity.

### Rebalancing

The [index](../i/index.md) is rebalanced on a regular [basis](../b/basis.md) to ensure that each stock remains equally [weighted](../w/weighted.md). This involves adjusting the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) of each stock held in the [index](../i/index.md).

## Historical Performance

Historically, the [Value](../v/value.md) Line Composite [Index](../i/index.md) has been an [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of the performance of a broad array of [stocks](../s/stock.md), providing a more diversified snapshot of the [market](../m/market.md) compared to more concentrated indices. By including a diverse set of [stocks](../s/stock.md) across different [market](../m/market.md) caps and sectors, it provides a comprehensive view of the overall [market](../m/market.md) performance.

## Components and Sectors

The [Value](../v/value.md) Line Composite [Index](../i/index.md) covers a wide [range](../r/range.md) of sectors including technology, health care, financial services, [consumer goods](../c/consumer_goods.md), and industrials among others. It includes large, mid, and small-cap companies, providing a more well-rounded view of the [market](../m/market.md).

# Value Line Composite Index

The **Value Line Composite Index** is a stock market index consisting of around 1,700 publicly traded companies from the NYSE, AMEX, NASDAQ, and over-the-counter markets. Created by Value Line, Inc., the index aims to offer a more inclusive representation of the broader market compared to indices focused only on large-cap stocks. This index is less reliant on market capitalization and instead focuses on an equally-weighted model, which means each stock in the index is given an equal weight regardless of its market size.

## Structure and Methodology

The Value Line Composite Index is unique in its equally-weighted structure. This methodology contrasts with market-cap-weighted indices like the S&P 500, where companies with larger market caps have a greater influence on the index's performance. In an equally-weighted index, every stock contributes equally, regardless of its market capitalization.

### Calculation

The index can be calculated using two primary methods:
1. **Arithmetic Mean**: An average of the daily percentage price changes of all stocks.
2. **Geometric Mean**: An average that takes the product of a set of numbers and then takes the nth root (where n is the total number of values). 

In practice, the Value Line Composite Index uses the arithmetic mean for simplicity.

### Rebalancing

The index is rebalanced on a regular basis to ensure that each stock remains equally weighted. This involves adjusting the number of shares of each stock held in the index.

## Historical Performance

Historically, the Value Line Composite Index has been an indicator of the performance of a broad array of stocks, providing a more diversified snapshot of the market compared to more concentrated indices. By including a diverse set of stocks across different market caps and sectors, it provides a comprehensive view of the overall market performance.

## Components and Sectors

# Volume Indicators

[Volume indicators](../v/volume_indicators.md) play a critical role in trading, offering insights into the strength and sustainability of a trend, the intensity of buying and selling pressure, and potential reversals. These indicators are built upon the volume of trading transactions over a certain period and provide additional context to price movements. Traders and investors use [volume indicators](../v/volume_indicators.md) to validate trends, predict reversals, and make informed decisions. This comprehensive guide explores the most widely used [volume indicators](../v/volume_indicators.md), their interpretation, and their application in trading.

## 1. On-Balance Volume (OBV)

On-Balance Volume (OBV) is a straightforward yet powerful indicator that measures cumulative volume by adding the day's volume when the price closes up and subtracting it when the price closes down. OBV helps traders gauge whether volume is increasing or decreasing relative to price movements.

### Calculation:
\[ OBV = OBV_{\text{previous}} + \begin{cases} 
      \text{Volume,} & \text{if } \text{Close}_{\text{today}} > \text{Close}_{\text{yesterday}} \\
      -\text{Volume,} & \text{if } \text{Close}_{\text{today}} < \text{Close}_{\text{yesterday}} \\
      0, & \text{if } \text{Close}_{\text{today}} = \text{Close}_{\text{yesterday}} 
   \end{cases}
\]

### Interpretation:
- **Bullish Signal:** OBV rises when the price rises, indicating that volume is confirming the uptrend.
- **Bearish Signal:** OBV falls when the price falls, indicating that volume is confirming the downtrend.
- **Divergence:** If OBV moves in the opposite direction of the price, it may indicate that the current trend is weakening and a reversal could occur.

## 2. Volume Price Trend (VPT)

The Volume Price Trend (VPT) indicator combines price and volume to determine the strength of a price trend. It calculates the percentage change in price and multiplies it by the current volume, adding this value to a running total.

### Calculation:
\[ VPT = VPT_{\text{previous}} + \left( \frac{\text{Close}_{\text{today}} - \text{Close}_{\text{yesterday}}}{\text{Close}_{\text{yesterday}}} \right) \times \text{Volume} \]

### Interpretation:
- **[Uptrend Confirmation](../u/uptrend_confirmation.md):** VPT rises with increasing price and volume.
- **Downtrend Confirmation:** VPT falls with decreasing price and volume.
- **Divergence:** Similar to OBV, divergence between VPT and price can signal potential reversals.

## 3. Accumulation/Distribution Line (A/D Line)

The Accumulation/Distribution Line (A/D Line) is built upon the relationship between price and volume. It emphasizes where the closing price is within the range for the day and adjusts based on volume, offering insight into the buying or selling pressure.

### Calculation:
\[ \text{A/D} = ((\text{Close} - \text{Low}) - (\text{High} - \text{Close})) / (\text{High} - \text{Low}) \times \text{Volume} \]
\[ \text{A/D Line} = \text{A/D Line}_{\text{previous}} + \text{A/D} \]

### Interpretation:
- **Buying Pressure:** When the A/D line is rising, it suggests more accumulation (buying) than distribution (selling).
- **Selling Pressure:** When the A/D line is falling, it indicates more distribution (selling) than accumulation (buying).
- **Divergence:** As with other indicators, divergence between the A/D line and price can indicate potential trend reversals.

## 4. Chaikin Money Flow (CMF)

Developed by Marc Chaikin, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) measures the money flow volume over a specific period, usually 21 days. It is a momentum indicator that assesses the buying and selling pressure.

### Calculation:
\[ \text{CMF} = \frac{\text{Sum of } \left[ \left( \left( \text{Close} - \text{Low} \right) - (\text{High} - \text{Close}) \right) / (\text{High} - \text{Low}) \times \text{Volume} \right]}{\text{Sum of Volume over period}} \]

### Interpretation:
- **Positive CMF:** Indicates strong buying pressure.
- **Negative CMF:** Indicates strong selling pressure.
- **Crossing the Zero Line:** When CMF passes above 0, it suggests a bullish trend, and below 0 indicates a bearish trend.

## 5. Money Flow Index (MFI)

The Money Flow Index (MFI) is a volume-weighted version of the Relative Strength Index (RSI), combining price and volume data. It ranges from 0 to 100 and is termed as a momentum indicator.

### Calculation:
\[ \text{Typical Price (TP)} = \frac{(\text{High} + \text{Low} + \text{Close})}{3} \]
\[ \text{Raw Money Flow} = \text{TP} \times \text{Volume} \]
\[ \text{Money Flow Ratio} = \frac{\text{Positive Money Flow (14-period)}}{\text{Negative Money Flow (14-period)}} \]
\[ \text{MFI} = 100 - \left( \frac{100}{1 + \text{Money Flow Ratio}} \right) \]

### Interpretation:
- **Overbought (>80):** Indicates a potentially overbought market, possible sell signal.
- **Oversold (<20):** Indicates a potentially oversold market, possible buy signal.
- **Divergence:** Divergence between MFI and price can signal trend reversals.

## 6. Negative Volume Index (NVI)

The Negative Volume Index (NVI) focuses on days when volume decreases from the previous day to indicate what smart money is doing. It's based on the idea that smart money is active on low-volume days.

### Calculation:
The NVI is calculated with adjustments only on days when the volume drops from the previous day:
\[ \text{NVI}_{\text{today}} = \begin{cases} 
      \text{NVI}_{\text{previous}} + \left( \frac{\text{Close}_{\text{today}} - \text{Close}_{\text{previous}}}{\text{Close}_{\text{previous}}} \times \text{NVI}_{\text{previous}} \right) & \text{if volume decreases} \\
      \text{NVI}_{\text{previous}} & \text{if volume does not decrease} 
   \end{cases}
\]

### Interpretation:
- **Rising NVI:** Indicates that price increases are being driven on low-volume days, suggesting the involvement of smart money.
- **Divergence:** As with the other indicators, divergence can be a signal of a potential change in trend.

## 7. Positive Volume Index (PVI)

The Positive Volume Index (PVI) is the counterpart to the Negative Volume Index, focusing on days with increased volume. It represents the behavior of retail investors who are thought to be more active on high-volume days.

### Calculation:
The PVI adjust only on days when the volume increases:
\[ \text{PVI}_{\text{today}} = \begin{cases} 
      \text{PVI}_{\text{previous}} + \left( \frac{\text{Close}_{\text{today}} - \text{Close}_{\text{previous}}}{\text{Close}_{\text{previous}}} \times \text{PVI}_{\text{previous}} \right) & \text{if volume increases} \\
      \text{PVI}_{\text{previous}} & \text{if volume does not increase} 
   \end{cases}
\]

### Interpretation:
- **Rising PVI:** Suggests that price movements are strong and supported by high volumes.
- **Divergence:** Similar to NVI, divergence can signal potential shifts in trend.

## 8. Volume Oscillator

The [Volume Oscillator](../v/volume_oscillator.md) employs the relationship between two moving averages to determine the level of volume and discern trend strength.

### Calculation:
\[ \text{[Volume Oscillator](../v/volume_oscillator.md)} = \text{Short-term Volume MA} - \text{Long-term Volume MA} \]

### Interpretation:
- **Positive Oscillator:** Indicates an increase in volume, suggesting stronger trends.
- **Negative Oscillator:** Indicates a decrease in volume, suggesting weakening trends.
- **Crossovers:** When the short-term MA crosses above the long-term MA, it indicates increasing volume and vice versa.

## 9. Klinger Oscillator

Developed by Stephen Klinger, the [Klinger Oscillator](../k/klinger_oscillator.md) aims to show long-term money flow trends while remaining sensitive enough to detect short-term fluctuations.

### Calculation:
\[ KO = EMA_{34}(\text{Volume} \times \text{T}) - EMA_{55}(\text{Volume} \times \text{T}) \]

Where:
\[ \text{T} = \left( 2 \times (\text{Close} - \text{Low} - \text{High})) / (\text{High} - \text{Low}) \right) \]

### Interpretation:
- **Bullish Klinger:** When the [Klinger Oscillator](../k/klinger_oscillator.md) is positive and rising, it indicates money flow is entering the market.
- **Bearish Klinger:** When the [Klinger Oscillator](../k/klinger_oscillator.md) is negative and falling, it indicates money flow is leaving the market.
- **Divergence:** As usual, divergence between the [Klinger Oscillator](../k/klinger_oscillator.md) and price movements can indicate potential reversals.

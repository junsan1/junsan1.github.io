# Vanilla Option

A vanilla option, often simply referred to as a plain vanilla option, is a standardized financial derivative that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price (known as the strike price) within a specific time frame (before the expiration date). These options are called "vanilla" because they are the most basic and common type of options contract, in contrast to more complex and exotic options.

Vanilla options can be divided into two main types:

1. **Call Option**: This gives the holder the right to buy the underlying asset at the strike price.
2. **Put Option**: This gives the holder the right to sell the underlying asset at the strike price.

## Key Components of a Vanilla Option

### Underlying Asset
The underlying asset is the financial instrument on which the option is based. This can be stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, indices, or even interest rates.

### Strike Price (Exercise Price)
The strike price is the specified price at which the underlying asset can be bought (call option) or sold (put option) by the option holder. This is agreed upon when the option contract is created and remains fixed throughout the life of the option.

### Expiration Date
The expiration date is the last day on which the option can be exercised. After this date, the option becomes worthless.

### Premium
The premium is the price paid by the option buyer to the option seller for the rights conveyed by the option. This is determined by various factors including the current price of the underlying asset, the strike price, time to expiration, and market volatility.

## Pricing Vanilla Options

Vanilla options are typically priced using models such as the Black-Scholes Model, which takes into account several variables:

1. **Current Price of the Underlying Asset**: The market price of the asset.
2. **Strike Price**: The price at which the asset can be bought or sold.
3. **Time to Expiration**: The time remaining until the option expires.
4. **Volatility**: The extent to which the underlying asset price is expected to fluctuate.
5. **Risk-Free Interest Rate**: The return on a risk-free investment, typically government bonds.
6. **Dividends**: Payments made by a company to its shareholders, relevant mainly for options on individual stocks.

## Basic Strategies Involving Vanilla Options

### 1. **Long Call**
- **Objective**: Profit from an increase in the underlying asset's price.
- **Risk**: Limited to the premium paid.
- **Reward**: Potentially unlimited.

### 2. **Short Call**
- **Objective**: Profit from a decrease in the underlying asset's price.
- **Risk**: Potentially unlimited as the asset's price can theoretically rise indefinitely.
- **Reward**: Limited to the premium received.

### 3. **Long Put**
- **Objective**: Profit from a decrease in the underlying asset's price.
- **Risk**: Limited to the premium paid.
- **Reward**: Limited to the strike price minus the premium paid (if the asset price falls to zero).

### 4. **Short Put**
- **Objective**: Profit from an increase or stabilization in the underlying asset's price.
- **Risk**: Significant but limited to the strike price minus the premium received.
- **Reward**: Limited to the premium received.

## Greeks in Vanilla Options

The "Greeks" are measures used to assess the risks and potential returns of options. They provide insights into how sensitive an option's price is to various factors. The primary Greeks for vanilla options include:

- **Delta**: Measures the sensitivity of the option's price to changes in the price of the underlying asset. For a call, delta is positive; for a put, delta is negative.
- **Gamma**: Measures the rate of change of delta over time or per unit movement in the underlying asset's price.
- **Theta**: Measures the sensitivity of the option's price to the passage of time. It reflects the time decay of the option.
- **Vega**: Measures the sensitivity of the option's price to changes in the volatility of the underlying asset.
- **Rho**: Measures the sensitivity of the option's price to changes in the risk-free interest rate.

## Example of a Vanilla Option Trade

### Scenario: Buying a Call Option

- **Underlying Asset**: Stock XYZ
- **Current Price**: $100
- **Strike Price**: $105
- **Expiration Date**: 3 months from today
- **Premium**: $2 per option

### Trade Actions and Outcomes

1. **Initiate the Trade**
   - You buy one call option contract for Stock XYZ.
   - Total cost is $2 (premium) * 100 (number of shares per contract) = $200.

2. **Possible Outcomes at Expiration**
   - **Stock Price Rises to $115**:
     - You exercise the option, buying 100 shares at $105 each.
     - Total cost = $10,500 (for 100 shares) + $200 (premium).
     - Market value of shares = $11,500 (100 shares * $115).
     - Profit = $11,500 - $10,500 - $200 = $800.
   
   - **Stock Price Remains at $100**:
     - The option expires worthless.
     - Loss is the premium paid = $200.
   
   - **Stock Price Falls to $95**:
     - The option expires worthless.
     - Loss is the premium paid = $200.

### Scenario: Writing a Put Option

- **Underlying Asset**: Stock ABC
- **Current Price**: $50
- **Strike Price**: $45
- **Expiration Date**: 2 months from today
- **Premium**: $1.50 per option

### Trade Actions and Outcomes

1. **Initiate the Trade**
   - You sell one put option contract for Stock ABC.
   - Total credit received is $1.50 (premium) * 100 (number of shares per contract) = $150.

2. **Possible Outcomes at Expiration**
   - **Stock Price Falls to $40**:
     - The buyer exercises the option, and you must buy 100 shares at $45 each.
     - Total cost = $4,500 (for 100 shares).
     - Market value of shares = $4,000 (100 shares * $40).
     - Loss = $500 - $150 (premium received) = $350.
   
   - **Stock Price Remains at $50**:
     - The option expires worthless.
     - Gain is the premium received = $150.
   
   - **Stock Price Rises to $55**:
     - The option expires worthless.
     - Gain is the premium received = $150.

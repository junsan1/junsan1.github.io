# Venture Philanthropy: What it Means, How it Works, Origins

Venture philanthropy is an innovative approach to giving where philanthropic organizations, individual donors, or social investors apply venture capital techniques to achieve philanthropic goals. Unlike traditional philanthropy, which often focuses solely on providing grants, venture philanthropy supports organizations with a combination of funding, expert advice, and performance measurement to achieve lasting, scalable social impact.

## Origins of Venture Philanthropy

The concept of venture philanthropy emerged in the late 20th century, drawing inspiration from venture capital, which involves investing in startups and working actively with them to improve their chances of success. The realization that similar practices could be applied to the non-profit and social sectors spurred the development of this approach.

### Key Milestones

1. **1970s-1980s**: The initial seeds of venture philanthropy were sown during this period, particularly through innovative funding practices in the United States.
2. **1990s**: The concept began to take a more defined shape with notable contributions from organizations such as Ashoka and the Roberts Enterprise Development Fund (REDF).
3. **2000s-Present**: Adoption of venture philanthropy has grown worldwide, with significant growth observed in Europe, Asia, and other regions.

## Core Principles of Venture Philanthropy

### Long-term Investment

Venture philanthropy emphasizes long-term support rather than one-time grants. This extended engagement allows organizations to plan and execute more complex, transformative projects.

### Tailored Financing

Venture philanthropists provide a mix of loans, equity, and grants, depending on what is best suited for the target organization. This flexibility helps match the financial needs of different non-profits and social enterprises.

### Capacity Building

Beyond financial support, venture philanthropy focuses on building the capacity of organizations. This includes providing strategic advice, operational support, and access to networks that can facilitate growth and impact.

### Measuring Impact

A critical component of venture philanthropy is rigorous performance measurement. Metrics are essential to track progress, understand outcomes, and ensure that resources are being utilized effectively.

### High Engagement

Venture philanthropists often take an active role in the organizations they support. This may involve sitting on boards, offering day-to-day support, or bringing in necessary expertise.

## How Venture Philanthropy Works

### Identification and Selection

The journey begins with identifying potential grantees or investees. This process is rigorous and involves due diligence assessments similar to those conducted by venture capital firms.

### Investment

Once an organization is selected, the venture philanthropist decides on the most appropriate form of investment. This could be a grant, a loan, or an equity stake, structured to meet the organization’s needs and promote sustainability.

### Support and Engagement

Post-investment, the relationship between the venture philanthropist and the non-profit/social enterprise is collaborative. Regular interactions, strategic reviews, and continuous support are integral to this phase.

### Monitoring and Evaluation

Continuous monitoring of progress against predefined goals and performance metrics ensures that the organization stays on track. This phase is essential for learning and adapting strategies as needed.

### Exit Strategy

An exit strategy is planned from the outset. This phase involves transitioning support away from the organization once it becomes self-sustaining or achieves the pre-agreed milestones.

# Venture Philanthropy

Venture [philanthropy](../p/philanthropy.md) is an innovative approach to giving where philanthropic organizations, individual donors, or social investors apply [venture capital](../v/venture_capital.md) techniques to achieve philanthropic goals. Unlike traditional [philanthropy](../p/philanthropy.md), which often focuses solely on providing grants, venture [philanthropy](../p/philanthropy.md) supports organizations with a combination of funding, expert advice, and performance measurement to achieve lasting, scalable social impact.

## Origins of Venture Philanthropy

The concept of venture [philanthropy](../p/philanthropy.md) emerged in the late 20th century, drawing inspiration from [venture capital](../v/venture_capital.md), which involves [investing](../i/investing.md) in startups and working actively with them to improve their chances of success. The realization that similar practices could be applied to the non-[profit](../p/profit.md) and social sectors spurred the development of this approach.

### Key Milestones

1. **1970s-1980s**: The initial seeds of venture [philanthropy](../p/philanthropy.md) were sown during this period, particularly through innovative funding practices in the United States.
2. **1990s**: The concept began to take a more defined shape with notable contributions from organizations such as Ashoka and the Roberts Enterprise Development [Fund](../f/fund.md) (REDF).
3. **2000s-Present**: Adoption of venture [philanthropy](../p/philanthropy.md) has grown worldwide, with significant growth observed in Europe, Asia, and other regions.

## Core Principles of Venture Philanthropy

### Long-term Investment

Venture [philanthropy](../p/philanthropy.md) emphasizes long-term support rather than one-time grants. This extended engagement allows organizations to plan and execute more complex, transformative projects.

### Tailored Financing

Venture philanthropists provide a mix of loans, [equity](../e/equity.md), and grants, depending on what is best suited for the target organization. This flexibility helps match the financial needs of different non-profits and social enterprises.

### Capacity Building

Beyond financial support, venture [philanthropy](../p/philanthropy.md) focuses on building the capacity of organizations. This includes providing strategic advice, operational support, and access to networks that can facilitate growth and impact.

### Measuring Impact

A critical component of venture [philanthropy](../p/philanthropy.md) is rigorous performance measurement. Metrics are essential to track progress, understand outcomes, and ensure that resources are being utilized effectively.

### High Engagement

Venture philanthropists often take an active role in the organizations they support. This may involve sitting on boards, [offering](../o/offering.md) day-to-day support, or bringing in necessary expertise.

## How Venture Philanthropy Works

### Identification and Selection

The journey begins with identifying potential grantees or investees. This process is rigorous and involves [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md) assessments similar to those conducted by [venture capital](../v/venture_capital.md) firms.

### Investment

Once an organization is selected, the venture philanthropist decides on the most appropriate form of investment. This could be a [grant](../g/grant.md), a [loan](../l/loan.md), or an [equity](../e/equity.md) stake, structured to meet the organization’s needs and promote sustainability.

### Support and Engagement

Post-investment, the relationship between the venture philanthropist and the non-[profit](../p/profit.md)/[social enterprise](../s/social_enterprise.md) is collaborative. Regular interactions, strategic reviews, and continuous support are integral to this phase.

### Monitoring and Evaluation

Continuous monitoring of progress against predefined goals and [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md) ensures that the organization stays on track. This phase is essential for learning and adapting strategies as needed.

### Exit Strategy

An [exit strategy](../e/exit_strategy.md) is planned from the outset. This phase involves transitioning support away from the organization once it becomes self-sustaining or achieves the pre-agreed milestones.

# Vector Decomposition

Vector decomposition is a mathematical technique that involves breaking down a vector into [multiple](../m/multiple.md) component vectors. In the context of trading, vector decomposition can be used to analyze and forecast [market](../m/market.md) movements, optimize portfolios, and develop sophisticated [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). This document [will](../w/will.md) explore the principles of vector decomposition, its applications in trading, various methods, and practical examples to provide a comprehensive understanding of the subject.

## Principles of Vector Decomposition

Vector decomposition involves expressing a vector as a sum of two or more component vectors. Formally, if **v** is a vector, it can be decomposed as:

**v** = **v₁** + **v₂** + ... + **vₙ**

where **v₁**, **v₂**, ..., **vₙ** are the component vectors. These components can be orthogonal (perpendicular) to each other, which makes the decomposition particularly useful in trading as it simplifies the analysis of complex vector spaces into manageable parts.

### Orthogonal Decomposition

Orthogonal decomposition is a common method where the components are mutually perpendicular. The advantage of orthogonal decomposition is that each component can be analyzed independently. This property is beneficial in trading when examining [uncorrelated assets](../u/uncorrelated_assets.md) or factors.

## Applications in Trading

Vector decomposition has several applications in trading, ranging from [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) to [risk management](../r/risk_management.md). Below are some key applications:

### 1. Technical Analysis

In [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md), vector decomposition can help analyze the price movements in [multiple](../m/multiple.md) dimensions. It can decompose [price action](../p/price_action.md) into trends and cycles, aiding in better understanding and prediction.

### 2. Portfolio Optimization

By decomposing [asset](../a/asset.md) returns into different factors, traders can isolate the contributions of various sources of [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md). This can lead to more efficient portfolio construction and improved [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md).

### 3. Risk Management

Vector decomposition allows [risk](../r/risk.md) managers to decompose the total [risk](../r/risk.md) of a portfolio into manageable parts. By understanding the contribution of each part to the overall [risk](../r/risk.md), managers can take specific actions to mitigate those risks.

### 4. Factor Analysis

Decomposition techniques like the [Principal Component Analysis](../p/principal_component_analysis_(pca).md) (PCA) can identify [underlying](../u/underlying.md) factors that drive [asset](../a/asset.md) returns. These factors can then be used to create more [robust](../r/robust.md) [trading models](../t/trading_models.md).

## Methods of Vector Decomposition

Several methods can be used for vector decomposition in trading. Some of the common methods include:

### 1. Eigendecomposition

In eigendecomposition, a matrix is decomposed into its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. This method is often used in the context of [covariance](../c/covariance.md) matrices to understand the [principal components](../p/principal_components_in_trading.md) of [asset](../a/asset.md) returns.

### 2. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

SVD decomposes a matrix into three other matrices, revealing the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) structure. This method is particularly useful in [noise](../n/noise.md) reduction and feature extraction in [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md).

### 3. Fourier Transform

The Fourier Transform decomposes a signal into its constituent frequencies. In trading, this can be used to analyze cyclical patterns in price data.

### 4. Wavelet Transform

Similar to the Fourier Transform, the [Wavelet Transform](../w/wavelet_transform_in_trading.md) decomposes data into components at different scales. This is useful for detecting patterns that vary over time.

## Practical Examples

To illustrate the application of vector decomposition in trading, below are some practical examples:

### Example 1: Technical Analysis Using Fourier Transform

Consider a stock price series that exhibits cyclical behavior. By applying the Fourier Transform, traders can identify the dominant frequencies and their amplitudes. This information helps in timing entries and exits by predicting future price cycles.

### Example 2: Portfolio Optimization Using PCA

Suppose a [trader](../t/trader.md) has a portfolio of various assets. By applying PCA to the [historical returns](../h/historical_returns.md) data, the [trader](../t/trader.md) can identify the [principal components](../p/principal_components_in_trading.md) (factors) that explain the most variance in the portfolio. This helps in understanding the key drivers of returns and optimizing the portfolio for desired [risk](../r/risk.md)/reward characteristics.

### Example 3: Risk Management Using Orthogonal Decomposition

Assume a portfolio has exposure to different [risk factors](../r/risk_factors_in_trading.md). By orthogonally decomposing the returns, the [risk](../r/risk.md) manager can isolate the impact of each [factor](../f/factor.md). This aids in precise [hedging strategies](../h/hedging_strategies.md) to mitigate specific risks without affecting the entire portfolio.

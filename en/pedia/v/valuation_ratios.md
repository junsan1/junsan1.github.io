# Valuation Ratios

[Valuation](../v/valuation.md) ratios are financial metrics that are commonly used by investors and analysts to assess the attractiveness of a company's stock. These ratios provide insight into whether a company's stock is [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md), [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md), or fairly priced compared to its [earnings](../e/earnings.md), [revenue](../r/revenue.md), [book value](../b/book_value.md), or other financial benchmarks. Here, we [will](../w/will.md) delve deeply into various [valuation](../v/valuation.md) ratios, explaining their significance, how they are calculated, and the context in which they are used.

## Price-Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio)
### Definition
The Price-[Earnings](../e/earnings.md) Ratio (P/E Ratio) is one of the most commonly used [valuation](../v/valuation.md) metrics. It measures the price investors are willing to pay for each dollar of [earnings](../e/earnings.md). The P/E Ratio is calculated by dividing the [market price](../m/market_price.md) per share of the company by its [earnings](../e/earnings.md) per share (EPS).

### Formula
\[ \text{P/E Ratio} = \frac{\text{[Market Price](../m/market_price.md) per Share}}{\text{[Earnings](../e/earnings.md) per Share (EPS)}} \]

### Interpretation
- **High P/E Ratio**: Indicates that investors expect high [growth rates](../g/growth_rates_in_trading.md) in the future. It might also suggest that the stock is [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md).
- **Low P/E Ratio**: Suggests that the stock might be [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md), or the company is experiencing difficulties.

### Example
If a company has a [market price](../m/market_price.md) of $50 per share and its EPS is $5, the P/E Ratio would be:
\[ \text{P/E Ratio} = \frac{50}{5} = 10 \]

### Usage Context
Investors use the P/E ratio to compare companies within the same [industry](../i/industry.md). It is less useful for comparing companies in different industries due to differing growth prospects and risks.

## Price-to-Book Ratio (P/B Ratio)
### Definition
The Price-to-Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) measures the [market](../m/market.md)'s [valuation](../v/valuation.md) of a company relative to its [book value](../b/book_value.md). [Book value](../b/book_value.md) is the net [asset](../a/asset.md) [value](../v/value.md) of a company, calculated as total assets minus intangible assets (patents, [goodwill](../g/goodwill.md)) and liabilities.

### Formula
\[ \text{P/B Ratio} = \frac{\text{[Market Price](../m/market_price.md) per Share}}{\text{[Book Value](../b/book_value.md) per Share}} \]

### Interpretation
- **High P/B Ratio**: Indicates that the [market](../m/market.md) believes the company's assets are valuable and expects high future growth.
- **Low P/B Ratio**: Might suggest that the stock is [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md), or it could be a result of [underlying](../u/underlying.md) problems with the company's [business](../b/business.md).

### Example
If a company has a [market price](../m/market_price.md) of $30 per share and its [book value](../b/book_value.md) per share is $10, the P/B Ratio would be:
\[ \text{P/B Ratio} = \frac{30}{10} = 3 \]

### Usage Context
The P/B Ratio is particularly useful for evaluating firms with significant [tangible assets](../t/tangible_asset.md), such as [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) companies or financial institutions.

## Price-to-Sales Ratio (P/S Ratio)
### Definition
The Price-to-Sales Ratio (P/S Ratio) compares a company's stock price to its revenues. This ratio is especially useful for evaluating companies that do not have [earnings](../e/earnings.md) yet, such as startups or companies in cyclical industries.

### Formula
\[ \text{P/S Ratio} = \frac{\text{[Market Capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md)}}{\text{Total Sales}} \]

### Interpretation
- **High P/S Ratio**: Indicates that investors expect high growth in the future.
- **Low P/S Ratio**: Suggests the stock might be [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md), or indicates potential financial troubles.

### Example
If a company has a [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) of $500 million and total sales of $100 million, the P/S Ratio would be:
\[ \text{P/S Ratio} = \frac{500}{100} = 5 \]

### Usage Context
The P/S Ratio is useful for comparing companies within the same [industry](../i/industry.md) and is particularly relevant for evaluating companies with negative [earnings](../e/earnings.md).

## Enterprise Value-to-EBITDA Ratio (EV/EBITDA)
### Definition
The Enterprise [Value](../v/value.md)-to-EBITDA Ratio (EV/EBITDA) measures the [value](../v/value.md) of a company, including [debt](../d/debt.md) and excluding cash, relative to the company's [earnings](../e/earnings.md) before [interest](../i/interest.md), [taxes](../t/taxes.md), [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md), and amortization (EBITDA).

### Formula
\[ \text{EV/EBITDA} = \frac{\text{Enterprise [Value](../v/value.md) (EV)}}{\text{EBITDA}} \]

### Interpretation
- **High EV/EBITDA Ratio**: Indicates that the company is potentially [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md), or it has high growth prospects.
- **Low EV/EBITDA Ratio**: Suggests that the company might be [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md).

### Example
If a company has an Enterprise [Value](../v/value.md) of $1 billion and an EBITDA of $200 million, the EV/EBITDA Ratio would be:
\[ \text{EV/EBITDA} = \frac{1,000}{200} = 5 \]

### Usage Context
The EV/EBITDA ratio is useful for comparing companies of different [capital](../c/capital.md) structures within the same [industry](../i/industry.md). It is a widely used metric for leveraged buyouts and other forms of [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md).

## Dividend Yield
### Definition
[Dividend Yield](../d/dividend_yield.md) measures the amount of cash dividends distributed to shareholders relative to the [market value](../m/market_value.md) per share. It indicates how much [income](../i/income.md) investors are getting for each dollar invested in a company's stock.

### Formula
\[ \text{[Dividend Yield](../d/dividend_yield.md)} = \frac{\text{Annual Dividends per Share}}{\text{[Market Price](../m/market_price.md) per Share}} \]

### Interpretation
- **High [Dividend Yield](../d/dividend_yield.md)**: Indicates that the company is returning a significant portion of its [earnings](../e/earnings.md) to shareholders.
- **Low [Dividend Yield](../d/dividend_yield.md)**: Suggests that the company is either reinvesting its [earnings](../e/earnings.md) for growth or it has a lower [distribution](../d/distribution.md) rate.

### Example
If a company pays an annual [dividend](../d/dividend.md) of $2 per share and the [market price](../m/market_price.md) is $40, the [Dividend Yield](../d/dividend_yield.md) would be:
\[ \text{[Dividend Yield](../d/dividend_yield.md)} = \frac{2}{40} = 0.05 \text{ or } 5\% \]

### Usage Context
Investors who are looking for steady [income](../i/income.md) often prefer [stocks](../s/stock.md) with higher [dividend](../d/dividend.md) yields. However, extremely high yields might be a warning sign of potential [financial distress](../f/financial_distress.md).

## Conclusion
[Valuation](../v/valuation.md) ratios are critical tools in the arsenal of investors and financial analysts. They provide a standardized way to assess whether [stocks](../s/stock.md) are [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md), [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md), or fairly valued. While each ratio has its strengths and weaknesses, using them in combination can provide a more holistic view of a company's [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and growth prospects.

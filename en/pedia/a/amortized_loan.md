# Amortized Loan

An amortized [loan](../l/loan.md) is a type of [loan](../l/loan.md) where the [principal](../p/principal.md) of the [loan](../l/loan.md) is paid down over the life of the [loan](../l/loan.md) (that is, amortized) according to an [amortization schedule](../a/amortization.md), typically through equal payments. This includes both [interest](../i/interest.md) and an allocated portion of the [principal](../p/principal.md) in each [payment](../p/payment.md) until the [loan](../l/loan.md) is paid off at the end of its term.

## Structure and Mechanics of Amortized Loans

### 1. Principal and Interest
The [principal](../p/principal.md) is the amount of [money](../m/money.md) borrowed initially. The [interest](../i/interest.md) is the cost attributed to borrowing that [principal](../p/principal.md). In amortized loans, each [payment](../p/payment.md) includes both [interest](../i/interest.md) and [principal](../p/principal.md) [repayment](../r/repayment.md) in a balanced way across the [loan](../l/loan.md) term.

### 2. Amortization Schedule
Amortization schedules detail each periodic [payment](../p/payment.md) broken down by the amount applied towards [interest](../i/interest.md) and the amount applied towards the [principal](../p/principal.md). The goal is to repay the [principal](../p/principal.md) gradually and reduce the [interest](../i/interest.md) over time. In the early stages of the [loan](../l/loan.md), a larger portion of each [payment](../p/payment.md) is allocated to [interest](../i/interest.md). With each successive [payment](../p/payment.md), the portion going towards the [principal](../p/principal.md) increases.

### 3. Term
The term of the [loan](../l/loan.md) is the period over which the [loan](../l/loan.md) [will](../w/will.md) be paid off. Common terms include 15, 20, or 30 years for mortgages, but other loans can have different terms based on type and agreement between borrower and [lender](../l/lender.md).

## Types of Amortized Loans

### Fixed Rate Mortgages
Fixed rate mortgages are typical examples of amortized loans. The [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) remains the same throughout the period of the [loan](../l/loan.md), leading to predictable monthly payments which simplify budgeting for homeowners.

### Auto Loans
Auto loans are often amortized loans with terms typically ranging from 3 to 7 years. These loans allow buyers to purchase vehicles by spreading the cost plus [interest](../i/interest.md) over a fixed period.

### Personal Loans
Personal loans which might be used for [debt consolidation](../d/debt_consolidation.md), [home](../h/home.md) improvement, or other large expenses are often structured as amortized loans.

## Mathematics of Amortized Loans

### Calculating Monthly Payments
The fixed monthly [payment](../p/payment.md) for an amortized [loan](../l/loan.md) is calculated using the formula:

\[ M = \frac{P[r(1+r)^n]}{[(1+r)^n - 1]} \]

Where:
- \( M \) is the total monthly [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [payment](../p/payment.md).
- \( P \) is the [loan](../l/loan.md) [principal](../p/principal.md).
- \( r \) is the monthly [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md). (Annual rate divided by 12)
- \( n \) is the number of payments ([loan](../l/loan.md) term in years multiplied by 12).

### Example Calculation
Assume you have a 30-year [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) of $200,000 with an annual [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) of 5%.

1. Convert the annual rate to a monthly rate:
\[ r = \frac{5\%}{12} = 0.004167 \]

2. Calculate the number of payments:
\[ n = 30 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 360 \text{ payments} \]

3. Apply the formula:
\[ M = \frac{200000[0.004167(1+0.004167)^{360}]}{[(1+0.004167)^{360} - 1]} \]
\[ M = \frac{200000[0.004167(4.4674)]}{[4.4674 - 1]} \]
\[ M = \frac{200000[0.0186]}{3.4674} \]
\[ M = \frac{3720}{3.4674} \approx 1073.64 \text{ dollars} \]

### Amortization Schedule Example
Using Excel or other financial calculators, you can build an [amortization schedule](../a/amortization.md) table, which [will](../w/will.md) show how each [payment](../p/payment.md) is split between [interest](../i/interest.md) and [principal](../p/principal.md), the remaining balance after each [payment](../p/payment.md), and the cumulative [interest](../i/interest.md) paid.

## Benefits of Amortized Loans

1. **Predictability**: The regular, fixed payments make budgeting easier for individuals and organizations.
2. **Building [Equity](../e/equity.md)**: For mortgages, as more of each [payment](../p/payment.md) goes towards the [principal](../p/principal.md) over time, borrowers build [equity](../e/equity.md).
3. **Decreased [Interest](../i/interest.md) Over Time**: As the [principal](../p/principal.md) is paid down, the amount of [interest](../i/interest.md) paid decreases (since [interest](../i/interest.md) is often calculated on the remaining balance).

## Drawbacks of Amortized Loans

1. **[Interest](../i/interest.md) Costs**: Early payments are heavily skewed towards [interest](../i/interest.md), meaning that less [principal](../p/principal.md) is paid off early.
2. **Fixed Terms**: Predictability comes with lack of flexibility; borrowers may feel constrained by the structure and inability to adjust payments without refinancing.
3. **Total [Interest](../i/interest.md) Paid**: Over the full term, a borrower might pay a large amount in [interest](../i/interest.md), making these loans potentially expensive over time.

## Options and Variants

### Refinancing
Borrowers may opt to [refinance](../r/refinance.md) an existing amortized [loan](../l/loan.md)—taking out a new [loan](../l/loan.md) to pay off the old one. Refinancing is often done to take advantage of lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, reduce monthly payments, or alter the [loan](../l/loan.md)'s term.

### Extra Payments
Making extra payments towards the [principal](../p/principal.md) can reduce the overall [interest](../i/interest.md) paid and shorten the term of the [loan](../l/loan.md). Lenders may allow these extra payments without penalties, but it’s important to understand the [loan](../l/loan.md)’s specific terms.

### Adjustable-Rate Mortgages (ARMs)
While not traditionally amortized in the same way as fixed-rate mortgages, ARMs can feature periods of fixed rates followed by adjustable periods. Payments could become unpredictable after the initial fixed-rate period.

### Bi-Weekly Payments
Some lenders [offer](../o/offer.md) bi-weekly [payment](../p/payment.md) arrangements rather than traditional monthly payments. Over the course of a year, this results in making the equivalent of 13 monthly payments (rather than 12), potentially reducing the [loan](../l/loan.md) term and saving on [interest](../i/interest.md).

## Notable Companies and Financial Tools

## Conclusion

Amortized loans, primarily seen in mortgages, auto loans, and personal loans, [offer](../o/offer.md) a structured, predictable means to borrow [money](../m/money.md). Their core advantage lies in the regular [payment](../p/payment.md) schedule, but understanding how [interest](../i/interest.md) and [principal](../p/principal.md) are calculated and applied over the life of the [loan](../l/loan.md) can help borrowers optimize their [money management strategies](../m/money_management_strategies.md). [Financial literacy](../f/financial_literacy.md) in this area is crucial for making informed borrowing decisions and reducing total [loan](../l/loan.md) costs through smart [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md) and extra payments.

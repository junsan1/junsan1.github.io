# Annuity Due

An annuity due is a type of financial contract where a series of equal payments are made at the beginning of each period. This is in contrast to an [ordinary annuity](../o/ordinary_annuity.md), where payments are made at the end of each period. The concept of an annuity due is often used in [finance](../f/finance.md), particularly in areas like [retirement planning](../r/retirement_planning.md), [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), and [valuation](../v/valuation.md) of financial instruments.

## Key Characteristics of Annuity Due

1. **Timing of Payments**: The defining feature of an annuity due is that payments are made at the start of each period. This means if the period is a month, the [payment](../p/payment.md) is made at the beginning of the month.
2. **Equal Payments**: The payments in an annuity due are typically fixed and equal over the contract's term.
3. **Fixed Term**: An annuity due has a specific period over which the payments [will](../w/will.md) be made, also known as the term of the annuity.
4. **[Interest Rate](../i/interest_rate.md)**: The payments are often calculated based on a specified [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md), which can either be fixed or variable.
5. **[Present Value](../p/present_value.md)**: The [present value of an annuity](../p/present_value_of_an_annuity.md) due is generally higher than that of an [ordinary annuity](../o/ordinary_annuity.md) because each [payment](../p/payment.md) is made earlier, allowing more time for the [invested capital](../i/invested_capital.md) to grow.

## Present Value and Future Value Calculations

### Present Value of Annuity Due

The [present value](../p/present_value.md) (PV) of an annuity due can be calculated using the following formula:

\[ PV = PMT \times \left( \frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r} \right) \times (1 + r) \]

where
- \( PV \) = [Present Value](../p/present_value.md) of the annuity due
- \( PMT \) = [Payment](../p/payment.md) amount per period
- \( r \) = [Interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) per period
- \( n \) = Number of periods

### Future Value of Annuity Due

The future [value](../v/value.md) (FV) of an annuity due can be calculated using the following formula:

\[ FV = PMT \times \left( \frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r} \right) \times (1 + r) \]

where
- \( FV \) = Future [Value](../v/value.md) of the annuity due
- \( PMT \) = [Payment](../p/payment.md) amount per period
- \( r \) = [Interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) per period
- \( n \) = Number of periods

## Applications of Annuity Due

### Retirement Planning

Annuities due are commonly used in [retirement planning](../r/retirement_planning.md). For example, an individual might purchase an annuity that pays out a fixed amount at the beginning of every month upon retirement. This provides a reliable [income](../i/income.md) stream and can be easier to manage when budgeting monthly expenses.

### Real Estate

In [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), rent payments are often structured as an annuity due, where tenants pay rent at the beginning of each rental period. This provides landlords with a steady and predictable [income](../i/income.md) stream.

### Insurance

[Insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies use annuities due in certain types of [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) and pension products. These products ensure that policyholders receive payments at the beginning of certain periods, such as monthly or annually.

### Education Funding

Annuities due can also be structured to [fund](../f/fund.md) education expenses, especially when parents or guardians want to ensure that payments for tuition or other educational costs are made at the start of each term or school year.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

1. **Higher [Present Value](../p/present_value.md)**: Because payments are made at the beginning of each period, the [present value of an annuity](../p/present_value_of_an_annuity.md) due is higher compared to an [ordinary annuity](../o/ordinary_annuity.md).
2. **Predictable [Income](../i/income.md) Stream**: This can be beneficial for budgeting and planning, especially for retirees who need steady [income](../i/income.md) at the beginning of each period.
3. **Potential Tax Benefits**: Depending on the jurisdiction and the specific financial product, there could be advantageous tax treatments for annuity due payments.

### Disadvantages

1. **Higher Initial Payments**: Since payments occur at the beginning of each period, individuals and businesses may need to manage their [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) more carefully.
2. **Complexity in Calculation**: The financial calculations for [present value](../p/present_value.md) and future [value](../v/value.md) are slightly more complex compared to an [ordinary annuity](../o/ordinary_annuity.md).
3. **Potential Fees and Charges**: Some financial products with features of annuity due may come with higher fees or charges.

## Conclusion

An annuity due is a [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) that provides a series of equal payments at the beginning of each period. It offers various benefits such as higher [present value](../p/present_value.md) and predictable [income](../i/income.md), making it a useful tool for [retirement planning](../r/retirement_planning.md), [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), [insurance](../i/insurance.md), and education funding. However, it also requires careful [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) management and understanding of its financial implications. Various financial institutions like Prudential, MetLife, [Fidelity Investments](../f/fidelity_investments.md), and TIAA [offer](../o/offer.md) products that utilize the annuity due structure.

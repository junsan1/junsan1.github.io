# Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance (AD&D)

Accidental Death and Dismemberment [Insurance](../i/insurance.md), commonly referred to as AD&D [insurance](../i/insurance.md), is a type of coverage designed to provide financial benefits to the insured's beneficiaries or to the insured themselves in case of accidental death or severe injury. Unlike standard [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md), AD&D specifically covers incidents resulting from accidents and does not account for death or injuries caused by natural causes or illnesses.

## Core Components of AD&D Insurance

The fundamental aspects of AD&D [insurance](../i/insurance.md) typically include coverage for:
- **Accidental Death**: In the event the insured person dies due to an accident, a predetermined benefit amount is paid out to their beneficiaries. This [payout](../p/payout.md) can be in addition to other [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policies the insured may [hold](../h/hold.md).
- **Dismemberment**: This refers to severe injuries resulting in the loss of limbs (arms, legs) or senses (vision, hearing). The [insurance](../i/insurance.md) policy provides a benefit based on the severity and type of injury. For example, the loss of one limb might trigger a 50% [payout](../p/payout.md) of the policy's [face value](../f/face_value.md), while the loss of two limbs could result in a 100% [payout](../p/payout.md).

## Accidents Covered Under AD&D

Accidents typically covered under AD&D policies include but are not limited to:
1. **Motor Vehicle Accidents**: Fatalities or injuries resulting from car crashes, motorcycle accidents, or other vehicular incidents.
2. **Workplace Accidents**: Injuries sustained while performing job duties, especially in high-[risk](../r/risk.md) occupations.
3. **Falls**: Accidents from trips, slips, or falls resulting in death or dismemberment.
4. **Exposure**: Physical harm due to exposure to elements like extreme heat or cold.
5. **Drownings**: Deaths from drowning incidents in pools, lakes, or oceans.

## Exclusions in AD&D Policies

AD&D policies do not cover deaths or injuries caused by:
- Illness or natural causes
- Suicide or self-inflicted injuries
- Drug overdose
- War or combat-related injuries
- Involvement in criminal activities

## Types of AD&D Insurance

### Group AD&D Insurance

Often provided as part of employee benefit packages, group AD&D [insurance](../i/insurance.md) is offered to a group of people under one master policy. This type of [insurance](../i/insurance.md) is commonly less expensive and might be fully or partially subsidized by the employer.

### Individual AD&D Insurance

Purchased directly from an [insurance](../i/insurance.md) company, individual AD&D policies can be tailored to meet personal needs. These policies are typically more expensive than group plans and [offer](../o/offer.md) personalized coverage amounts and terms.

### Voluntary AD&D Insurance

Voluntary AD&D [insurance](../i/insurance.md) is an optional, supplemental coverage that employees can choose to purchase in addition to their primary [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md). Premiums are usually paid by employees through [payroll](../p/payroll.md) deductions.

## Key Benefits of AD&D Insurance

1. **Affordable Premiums**: AD&D policies are generally more affordable compared to standard [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) premiums because of the limited coverage [scope](../s/scope.md).
2. **Supplemental Coverage**: These policies provide an additional layer of financial protection in conjunction with other [insurance](../i/insurance.md) plans the policyholder may have.
3. **Quick Payouts**: Beneficiaries typically receive payouts faster under AD&D policies, which can be crucial for covering immediate expenses following an accident.

## Determining the Right AD&D Coverage

When selecting an AD&D policy, individuals should consider:
- The amount of coverage needed to support dependents or cover medical expenses.
- Occupation and lifestyle risks that may necessitate higher coverage.
- The policy's specific terms, conditions, and exclusions to understand exactly what is covered.

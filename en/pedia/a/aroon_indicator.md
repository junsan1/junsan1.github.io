# Aroon Indicator

The Aroon [Indicator](../i/indicator.md), developed by Tushar Chande in 1995, is a [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) tool used to identify the beginning of a new [trend](../t/trend.md), its strength, and the likelihood of its continuation in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). The [indicator](../i/indicator.md) is part of the broader category of [momentum oscillators](../m/momentum_oscillators.md) and falls under the subset of [trend](../t/trend.md)-following indicators. The term "Aroon" is derived from the Sanskrit word for "dawn's early light," symbolizing the hope of identifying new trends early.

The Aroon [Indicator](../i/indicator.md) consists of two lines:
- **Aroon Up**: Measures the number of periods since the highest high during a specific period.
- **Aroon Down**: Measures the number of periods since the lowest low during a specific period.

## Calculation

The Aroon [Indicator](../i/indicator.md) typically uses a 25-period [default](../d/default.md) setting, but this can be adjusted based on the [trader](../t/trader.md)'s preferences and the specific [asset](../a/asset.md) being analyzed. Here's how each line is calculated:

### Aroon Up

\[ Aroon_{Up} = \frac{25 - \text{Periods since 25-period-high}}{25} \times 100 \]

### Aroon Down

\[ Aroon_{Down} = \frac{25 - \text{Periods since 25-period-low}}{25} \times 100 \]

Both the Aroon Up and Aroon Down are expressed as percentages and can [range](../r/range.md) from 0 to 100.

## Interpretation

The main objective of the Aroon [Indicator](../i/indicator.md) is to reveal the prevailing direction and strength of a [trend](../t/trend.md). The primary interpretations include:

- **When Aroon Up is above 70 and Aroon Down is below 30**, it suggests that an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md) is strong.
- **When Aroon Down is above 70 and Aroon Up is below 30**, it indicates that a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md) is dominant.
- **When both Aroon Up and Aroon Down are below 50**, it suggests [consolidation](../c/consolidation.md) or a lack of a clear [trend](../t/trend.md).
- **When both Aroon Up and Aroon Down are close to each other**, it reflects a potential change in [trend](../t/trend.md) or a consolidated [market](../m/market.md).

## Practical Application

The Aroon [Indicator](../i/indicator.md) is often used in conjunction with other [technical analysis tools](../t/technical_analysis_tools.md) to confirm trends and potential reversals. Traders may look for:
- **Crosses**: When the Aroon Up crosses above the Aroon Down, it can signal a potential bullish [trend](../t/trend.md), and vice versa.
- **Thresholds**: Traders often use specific thresholds (e.g., crossing 50) to validate the [trend](../t/trend.md)'s strength.

## Example

Imagine you are trading a stock and applying a 25-period Aroon [Indicator](../i/indicator.md). Suppose the stock reaches its highest point in 20 periods and its lowest point in 5 periods during the analysis window:
- Aroon Up = \[ \frac{25 - 5}{25} \] x 100 = 80
- Aroon Down = \[ \frac{25 - 20}{25} \] x 100 = 20

These values indicate a strong [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md) as the Aroon Up is significantly higher than the Aroon Down.

## Advantages

- **Early Detection**: The Aroon [Indicator](../i/indicator.md) helps in identifying early signs of [trend](../t/trend.md) formation.
- **Non-lagging**: Compared to moving averages, the Aroon is relatively quick in responding to price changes.
- **Simplicity**: Its calculation and interpretation are straightforward.

## Limitations

- **[False Signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md)**: It can generate [false signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md) in a volatile [market](../m/market.md).
- **No Magnitude**: It indicates the presence of a [trend](../t/trend.md) but not the magnitude of price change.
- **Lag**: In highly fluctuating markets, the Aroon may lag or provide delayed signals.

## Conclusion

The Aroon [Indicator](../i/indicator.md) is a valuable tool for traders aiming to identify and confirm [market](../m/market.md) trends. Its simplicity and ability to detect trends early make it a popular choice among both novice and experienced traders. When used in conjunction with other indicators and a comprehensive [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md), it can significantly enhance [trading performance](../t/trading_performance.md) and decision-making.

# Accredited Investor

An accredited [investor](../i/investor.md) is a person or a legal entity that is allowed to [trade](../t/trade.md) securities that are not registered with financial authorities. In the United States, Rule 501 of Regulation D of the [Securities Act of 1933](../s/securities_act_of_1933.md) establishes the criteria for being considered an accredited [investor](../i/investor.md). Accredited investors are typically high-net-worth individuals, funds, or financial institutions that have sufficient financial knowledge and stability to engage in more complex and, often, higher-[risk](../r/risk.md) investment opportunities.

## Definition and Criteria

The U.S. Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) defines accredited investors under Rule 501 of Regulation D. The criteria include:

1. **[Income](../i/income.md) Requirement**: Individuals who have an [income](../i/income.md) exceeding $200,000 in each of the two most recent years or $300,000 together with a spouse, and a reasonable expectation of the same [income](../i/income.md) level in the current year.
2. **[Net Worth](../n/net_worth.md) Requirement**: Individuals whose [net worth](../n/net_worth.md), or [joint](../j/joint.md) [net worth](../n/net_worth.md) with their spouse, exceeds $1 million at the time of the purchase, excluding the [value](../v/value.md) of their primary residence.
3. **Entities**: Trusts, partnerships, corporations, or other organizations with assets exceeding $5 million, not formed for the specific purpose of acquiring the securities offered.
4. **Insiders**: Directors, executive officers, or general partners of the company selling the securities.
5. **Qualified Entities**: Banks, [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies, registered investment companies, [business](../b/business.md) development companies, or small [business](../b/business.md) investment companies.

These criteria ensure that accredited investors possess sufficient financial knowledge and can bear the [financial risk](../f/financial_risk.md) associated with unregistered securities.

## Importance in Financial Markets

Accredited investors play a crucial role in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) for several reasons:

1. **Access to Private Placements**: They can buy securities through private placements, [offering](../o/offering.md) companies a way to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) without the lengthy and expensive process of a public [offering](../o/offering.md).
2. **Increased [Market Efficiency](../m/market_efficiency.md)**: Their participation in different markets, including [venture capital](../v/venture_capital.md), [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds, and [private equity](../p/private_equity.md) funds, enhances [market efficiency](../m/market_efficiency.md) and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).
3. **Support for Innovation**: By funding startups and emerging companies, accredited investors play a pivotal role in fostering innovation and [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md).

## Risks and Responsibilities

While accredited investors have access to unique opportunities, they also face significant risks:

1. **Lack of Regulatory Oversight**: Securities purchased by accredited investors are often less transparent and subject to fewer regulatory requirements, increasing the [risk](../r/risk.md) of [fraud](../f/fraud.md) and misinformation.
2. **Higher [Risk](../r/risk.md) Investments**: These investments can be highly speculative, with the potential for significant financial loss.
3. **[Due Diligence](../d/due_diligence.md)**: Accredited investors must conduct thorough [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md) and often rely on their financial acumen or professional advice to evaluate investment opportunities.

## How to Become an Accredited Investor

In the United States, there's no formal application to become an accredited [investor](../i/investor.md). Instead, companies [offering](../o/offering.md) unregistered securities typically have investors fill out questionnaires or provide documentation verifying their qualifications. This process helps ensure compliance with SEC regulations.

However, some other countries have different processes; for instance, Canada requires individuals to meet specific provincial requirements, while in the [European Union](../e/european_union_(eu).md), the criteria are governed by the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive ([MiFID II](../m/mifid_ii.md)).

## Legal and Regulatory Framework

The concept of accredited investors is designed to protect inexperienced investors from high-[risk](../r/risk.md) investments that may not be suitable for their financial situation. The SEC enforces regulations to define and monitor the status of accredited investors:

1. **Regulation D**: Provides exemptions from registration requirements for some securities offerings, with certain rules and limitations to ensure [investor](../i/investor.md) protection.
2. **Form D Filing**: Companies must file a Form D with the SEC when they sell securities through private placements, disclosing information about the [offering](../o/offering.md), including the accredited [investor](../i/investor.md) status of its participants.
3. **Ongoing Amendments**: The SEC regularly reviews and updates the defined criteria to account for economic changes and to maintain fair [market](../m/market.md) standards.

Further, countries worldwide adopt similar frameworks to align with global financial regulations and protect investors.

## Notable Organizations and Websites

Several organizations provide services and platforms tailored for accredited investors:

1. **AngelList**: A well-known platform that connects startups with accredited investors, [offering](../o/offering.md) opportunities in [venture capital](../v/venture_capital.md) and angel [investing](../i/investing.md) [AngelList](https://angel.co/).

# Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (ARM)

An adjustable-rate [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) (ARM) is a type of [home](../h/home.md) [loan](../l/loan.md) where the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) applied on the outstanding balance varies throughout the life of the [loan](../l/loan.md). This contrasts with a [fixed-rate mortgage](../f/fixed-rate_mortgage.md), where the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) remains constant over the [loan](../l/loan.md) term. ARMs are characterized by an [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) that changes periodically—typically in relation to an [index](../i/index_instrument.md)—and payments that may go up or down accordingly. Because of this [variability](../v/variability.md), ARMs carry both potential benefits and risks for borrowers.

## How Adjustable-Rate Mortgages Work

### Initial Fixed-Rate Period
ARMs usually begin with an initial period during which the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) remains fixed. This period can [range](../r/range.md) from a few months to several years. Common initial fixed periods include 3, 5, 7, or 10 years. This allows borrowers to enjoy lower initial [interest](../i/interest.md) rates compared to fixed-rate mortgages.

### Adjustment Period
After the initial fixed-rate period, the ARM enters the adjustment period. During this time, the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) can change at regular intervals, such as every month, every six months, every year, or another specified period, depending on the [loan](../l/loan.md) terms. The adjustment period [will](../w/will.md) continue until the [loan](../l/loan.md) is paid off, sold, or refinanced.

### Index and Margin
The new [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) during the adjustment period is determined by adding a [margin](../m/margin.md) to an [index](../i/index_instrument.md) rate. Common indices used for ARMs include:
- **LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate)**
- **COFI (Cost of Funds [Index](../i/index_instrument.md))**
- **CMT (Constant [Maturity](../m/maturity.md) Treasury)**
- **SOFR (Secured Overnight [Financing](../f/financing.md) Rate)**

The [margin](../m/margin.md) is a percentage added to the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) rate, which remains fixed for the life of the [loan](../l/loan.md).

### Rate Caps
Rate caps limit how much the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) can change at any adjustment. Typical caps include:
- **Initial Adjustment Cap**: Limits how much the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) can increase the first time it adjusts after the fixed period.
- **Subsequent Adjustment Cap**: Limits how much the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) can change at each subsequent adjustment period.
- **Lifetime Adjustment Cap**: Limits the total increase in the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) over the life of the [loan](../l/loan.md).

### Payment Caps
Some ARMs may include a [payment](../p/payment.md) cap, which limits how much the monthly [payment](../p/payment.md) can increase at each adjustment regardless of how much the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) increases. This could lead to [negative amortization](../n/negative_amortization.md), where the [loan](../l/loan.md) balance increases because the payments are not covering the [interest](../i/interest.md) charges.

## Types of Adjustable-Rate Mortgages

Various types of ARMs are structured based on different terms and adjustment rules:

### Hybrid ARMs
Hybrid ARMs combine features of fixed-rate mortgages and adjustable-rate mortgages. For example, a 5/1 ARM has a fixed rate for the first five years and then adjusts annually afterward.

### Interest-Only ARMs
[Interest](../i/interest.md)-only ARMs allow borrowers to pay only the [interest](../i/interest.md) for a specified time, often the initial fixed-rate period. After that, payments are recalculated to include both [principal](../p/principal.md) and [interest](../i/interest.md), sometimes leading to a significant [payment](../p/payment.md) increase.

### Payment-Option ARMs
[Payment](../p/payment.md)-option ARMs give borrowers [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [payment](../p/payment.md) [options](../o/options.md) each month, such as a minimum [payment](../p/payment.md), an [interest](../i/interest.md)-only [payment](../p/payment.md), or a [fully amortizing payment](../f/fully_amortizing_payment.md). These [options](../o/options.md) provide flexibility but can result in [negative amortization](../n/negative_amortization.md).

## Pros and Cons of ARMs

### Advantages
- **Lower Initial Rates**: ARMs often start with lower rates than fixed-rate loans, making them more affordable initially.
- **Flexibility**: Beneficial for borrowers who plan to sell or [refinance](../r/refinance.md) before the adjustment period begins.
- **Rate Decrease Potential**: If [market](../m/market.md) rates decline, ARM rates and payments might also decrease.

### Disadvantages
- **[Uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md)**: Future rate and [payment](../p/payment.md) levels are uncertain, making budgeting more difficult.
- **Complexity**: ARMs have more complex terms and features, requiring borrowers to understand all adjustment rules.

## Who Should Consider an ARM?

ARMs may be appropriate for:
- Borrowers who plan to move before the initial rate period ends.
- Those expecting their [income](../i/income.md) to increase.
- Individuals in high-[interest](../i/interest.md)-rate environments anticipating rate declines.

## How to Compare ARMs

### Annual Percentage Rate (APR)
Consider the APR, which reflects the ARM's total borrowing cost, including initial rates and future adjustments. A lower APR can indicate a lower overall cost.

### Caps and Index
Understand the potential rate increases by examining indexed caps and margins. Some indices are more volatile, affecting how much and how fast rates can change.

### Loan Documentation
Review the [Loan](../l/loan.md) Estimate and Closing [Disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) for complete terms and conditions. These documents outline the specifics of both [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) adjustments and [payment](../p/payment.md) caps.

## Conclusion

Adjustable-rate mortgages are a complex but potentially advantageous financial product for specific types of borrowers. They [offer](../o/offer.md) initial lower rates and flexibility but come with inherent risks due to [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) [variability](../v/variability.md). A sound understanding of the terms, potential changes in payments, and how they fit a borrower's financial situation is essential. Those considering ARMs should carefully weigh these factors and consult with a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) advisor to make an informed decision.

# Assessed Value

## Introduction
Assessed [value](../v/value.md) is a critical concept in [finance](../f/finance.md), [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), and [taxation](../t/taxation.md). It refers to the determined [value](../v/value.md) of a property by a public tax assessor for purposes of [taxation](../t/taxation.md). This [valuation](../v/valuation.md) process is vital for local governments as it forms the [basis](../b/basis.md) for [property tax](../p/property_tax.md) calculations. 

### Definition
Assessed [value](../v/value.md) is the dollar [value](../v/value.md) assigned to a property for the purposes of measuring applicable [taxes](../t/taxes.md). It is determined by the local municipal property assessor and is used to calculate the annual property [taxes](../t/taxes.md) owed by the property owner. Assessment methodologies can vary significantly from one jurisdiction to another, making it essential for property owners to understand how their property's [value](../v/value.md) is determined and the implications it has on their liabilities.

## Determining Assessed Value
The process of determining the assessed [value](../v/value.md) of a property involves several steps and considerations:

### Property Inspection
Property assessors may conduct physical inspections of properties to evaluate their condition and any changes or improvements since the last assessment. This includes evaluating the structure, interior qualities, lot conditions, and any additional features.

### Market Analysis
Assessors analyze the local [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) [market](../m/market.md), using comparable sales data (comps) to ascertain what similar properties in the area have been selling for. This data helps in determining the fair [market value](../m/market_value.md) of the property.

### Determining the Assessment Ratio
Local governments set an assessment ratio, which is the percentage of the property's [market value](../m/market_value.md) that is subject to [taxation](../t/taxation.md). For instance, a jurisdiction might have an assessment ratio of 80%, meaning that only 80% of the property's [market value](../m/market_value.md) [will](../w/will.md) be used to calculate the assessed [value](../v/value.md).

### Calculation Formula
The formula to calculate the assessed [value](../v/value.md) typically looks like this:
\[ \text{Assessed Value} = \text{[Market Value](../m/market_value.md)} \times \text{Assessment Ratio} \]
For example, if a property has a [market value](../m/market_value.md) of $500,000 and the assessment ratio is 80%, the assessed [value](../v/value.md) would be:
\[ \$500,000 \times 0.80 = \$400,000 \]

### Revaluation Cycles
Most jurisdictions have regular intervals (e.g., annually, biennially) at which they reassess property values. This ensures that property [taxes](../t/taxes.md) reflect current [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

## Importance in Taxation
Assessed values are crucial in determining how much [revenue](../r/revenue.md) a municipality can generate through property [taxes](../t/taxes.md). Each property ownerâ€™s tax bill is calculated by multiplying the assessed [value](../v/value.md) of their property by the [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md) set by the local government. 

### Example Calculation
If the [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md) is 1.5%, the [property tax](../p/property_tax.md) owed on a property with an assessed [value](../v/value.md) of $400,000 would be:
\[ \text{[Property Tax](../p/property_tax.md)} = \text{Assessed [Value](../v/value.md)} \times \text{[Tax Rate](../t/tax_rate.md)} \]
\[ \text{[Property Tax](../p/property_tax.md)} = \$400,000 \times 0.015 = \$6,000 \]

## Differences: Market Value vs. Assessed Value
It's important to distinguish between [market value](../m/market_value.md) and assessed [value](../v/value.md):

### Market Value
[Market value](../m/market_value.md) is the estimated amount for which a property should [exchange](../e/exchange.md) on the date of [valuation](../v/valuation.md) between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an [arm's length transaction](../a/arm's_length_transaction.md) after proper [marketing](../m/marketing.md) wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently, and without compulsion.

### Assessed Value
Assessed [value](../v/value.md), on the other hand, is used specifically for tax purposes and may not always align with the [market value](../m/market_value.md). The assessed [value](../v/value.md) may be lower than the [market value](../m/market_value.md) depending upon the assessment ratio and relevant exemptions that may apply.

## Factors Affecting Assessed Value
Various factors can impact the assessed [value](../v/value.md) of a property:

### Location
Properties located in high-[demand](../d/demand.md) areas or regions with high property values [will](../w/will.md) generally have higher assessed values.

### Property Size and Features
Larger properties and those with additional features (like a swimming pool, a garage, or high-quality interior finishes) can result in higher assessments.

### Market Trends
Fluctuations in the [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) [market](../m/market.md) can influence assessed values. A booming [market](../m/market.md) may lead to higher assessed values, while a declining [market](../m/market.md) may reduce them.

### Improvements and Renovations
Any improvements or significant renovations can increase a property's assessed [value](../v/value.md). These are usually factored in during property inspections or when the property owner declares them.

### Depreciation
[Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) is a decrease in the [value](../v/value.md) of a property over time due to wear and tear, aging, or obsolescence. Recognizing [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) helps assessors in adjusting the [value](../v/value.md) of older properties correctly.

## Appealing an Assessed Value
Property owners who believe that their property's assessed [value](../v/value.md) is too high have the right to appeal the assessment. The appeal process usually involves the following steps:

### Obtain Assessment Records
Review the assessment records for accuracy. Any errors in the property data can be grounds for appeal.

### Comparable Sales Analysis
Conduct an analysis of comparable property sales to support the case that your property is [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md).

### Appeal Filing
File a formal appeal with the local assessment office within the designated timeframe. The appeal typically requires submitting evidence that the assessed [value](../v/value.md) is not reflective of the fair [market value](../m/market_value.md).

### Hearing
Attend a hearing where evidence [will](../w/will.md) be reviewed, and a determination [will](../w/will.md) be made.

### Outcome
If the appeal is successful, the assessed [value](../v/value.md) and consequently, the [property tax](../p/property_tax.md) bill [will](../w/will.md) be adjusted.

## Assessed Value in Different Jurisdictions
The role and application of assessed [value](../v/value.md) can vary significantly across different jurisdictions:

### United States
In the United States, [property tax](../p/property_tax.md) assessments are conducted at the state, county, or municipal level. For example, New York City has a detailed property assessment process carried out by the Department of [Finance](../f/finance.md).

### Canada
In Canada, properties are assessed by provincial agencies. BC Assessment, for instance, manages property assessments in the province of British Columbia.

### United Kingdom
The UK doesn't utilize an "assessed [value](../v/value.md)" in the same way but instead uses a system of council tax bands based on the property [value](../v/value.md) as of April 1991.

## Conclusion
Understanding the concept of assessed [value](../v/value.md) is fundamental for property owners, investors, and [finance](../f/finance.md) professionals. It impacts yearly property [taxes](../t/taxes.md) and can have significant financial implications. Familiarity with how assessed values are determined, the ability to analyze and appeal these assessments, and an awareness of how they function in different jurisdictions are critical to managing and planning property investments effectively.

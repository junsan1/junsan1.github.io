# Anchored VWAP

The Anchored Volume Weighted Average Price (Anchored VWAP) is a [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) tool that is extensively used in the field of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). This metric extends the concept of the standard VWAP but allows traders to "anchor" the calculation to a specific date or event, giving it significant flexibility and utility in diverse [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

### What is Anchored VWAP?

VWAP, or Volume Weighted Average Price, calculates the average price a security has traded at throughout the day, based on both volume and price. Unlike the traditional VWAP that starts its calculation at the beginning of each trading day, Anchored VWAP allows traders to set a custom starting point for the calculation, known as the "anchor." This starting point can be a specific date, time, or price level that is relevant to the trader's strategy.

### Calculation of Anchored VWAP

To understand Anchored VWAP, let's break down its calculation step by step:

1. **Select an Anchor Point:** This could be a date, time, or an event. Common anchor points include the beginning of a significant economic report, earnings announcement, or a pivotal [trend reversal](../t/trend_reversal.md).

2. **Calculate Cumulative VWAP from the Anchor Point:** 
   \[
   VWAP = \frac{\sum_{i=t_{anchor}}^{t} P_i \times V_i}{\sum_{i=t_{anchor}}^{t} V_i}
   \]
   Where:
   - \( P_i \) is the price of the trade at time \( i \)
   - \( V_i \) is the volume of the trade at time \( i \)
   - \( t_{anchor} \) is the selected anchor time
   - \( t \) is the current time

### Applications in Trading

#### Trend Analysis

1. **Confirmation of Trends:** Traders can use Anchored VWAP to confirm trends. If the security is trading above the Anchored VWAP, it is considered to be in an uptrend, whereas trading below it signifies a downtrend.

2. **[Support and Resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) Levels:** The Anchored VWAP can act as dynamic support or resistance. Institutional traders may place significant orders around these levels, adding credence to its utility in decision-making.

#### Event-Based Trading

By anchoring the VWAP to significant events like earnings releases or economic data announcements, traders can gauge market sentiment post-event and identify potential bullish or bearish continuations.

#### Mean Reversion Strategies

Anchored VWAP often features prominently in [mean reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md) strategies. Traders may look for securities to deviate significantly from the Anchored VWAP and place trades anticipating a reversion back to the average.

### Comparison with Traditional VWAP

#### Flexibility

Traditional VWAP is calculated from the beginning of the trading day. In contrast, the Anchored VWAP offers the flexibility to set any starting point. This customization enhances its ability to adapt to different strategies and market conditions.

#### Adaptability

Standard VWAP becomes less meaningful as an intraday tool in volatile markets where price moves are driven by specific events. Anchored VWAP effectively addresses this by allowing traders to align the VWAP with impactful occurrences.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

#### Advantages

- **Customization:** One of the most significant benefits is the ability to start the calculation from any point. This is crucial for aligning the VWAP with specific trade strategies or market events.
- **Enhanced Signal Accuracy:** By considering time periods around pivotal market events, Anchored VWAP offers more accurate [trading signals](../t/trading_signals.md).
- **Effective [Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md):** It helps identify potential [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels that are dynamic and responsive to real market conditions, therefore aiding in more effective [risk management](../r/risk_management.md).

#### Disadvantages

- **Complexity:** The need to select appropriate anchor points adds a layer of complexity to using Anchored VWAP.
- **Computational Intensity:** Anchored VWAP calculations can be computationally intensive, particularly when dealing with large datasets or high-frequency trading environments.
- **Subjectivity:** The choice of anchor point can be subjective, introducing potential biases based on the trader's interpretation of market events.

### Software and Tools Supporting Anchored VWAP

Several trading platforms and software tools provide functionalities to compute and use Anchored VWAP. Notable among these are:

- **[TradingView](../t/tradingview.md):** [TradingView](../t/tradingview.md) offers extensive charting capabilities, including the use of custom indicators like Anchored VWAP. [More Information](https://www.tradingview.com)
- **[Thinkorswim](../t/thinkorswim.md):** Provided by TD Ameritrade, this trading platform offers customization options for [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md), allowing traders to apply Anchored VWAP.

- **Sierra Chart:** Known for its robustness in handling various data feeds and custom indicators, Sierra Chart is another platform where traders can use Anchored VWAP. [More Information](https://www.sierrachart.com)

### Practical Examples

#### Example 1: Earnings Release

A trader wishes to analyze the impact of an earnings announcement on a stock price. They anchor the VWAP calculation to the exact time of the earnings release. By doing so, they can observe how the price has moved relative to the volume-weighted average price post-announcement, thus gauging market sentiment.

#### Example 2: Economic Data Announcement

During employment data announcements, significant market movements can occur. A forex trader anchors the VWAP to the release time of the employment report. Observing how the exchange rate moves relative to the Anchored VWAP can provide insights into the currency market's reaction to the data.

#### Example 3: Trend Reversal

A stock appears to undergo a [trend reversal](../t/trend_reversal.md) after hitting a significant low. A trader anchors the VWAP to this low point to assess the strength and sustainability of the new upward trend. If the stock consistently trades above the Anchored VWAP, it may confirm the reversal.

### Conclusion

The Anchored VWAP is a powerful and versatile tool in the arsenal of algorithmic traders and technical analysts. Its ability to anchor calculations to significant dates and events allows for tailored analysis and strategy development. Whether used for trend confirmation, [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) identification, or event-based trading, Anchored VWAP can provide crucial insights and enhance decision-making in the dynamic trading landscape.

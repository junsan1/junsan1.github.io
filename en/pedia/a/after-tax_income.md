# After-Tax Income

After-tax [income](../i/income.md), also known as net [income](../i/income.md), is the amount of [money](../m/money.md) that remains with an individual or a [business](../b/business.md) after all [taxes](../t/taxes.md) have been deducted from [gross income](../g/gross_income.md). For individuals, it's the [income](../i/income.md) left after federal, state, local, and [payroll](../p/payroll.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) have been subtracted. For businesses, it means the amount left after corporate [income](../i/income.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) and other [business](../b/business.md)-related [taxes](../t/taxes.md) have been paid.

Understanding after-tax [income](../i/income.md) is crucial for various reasons, including budgeting, saving, [investing](../i/investing.md), and determining true [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md).

## Significance of After-Tax Income

After-tax [income](../i/income.md) is a fundamental concept in [personal finance](../p/personal_finance_in_trading.md) and [business](../b/business.md) [finance](../f/finance.md) because it represents the actual amount of [money](../m/money.md) available for discretionary spending, saving, and [investing](../i/investing.md).

### Personal Finance

In [personal finance](../p/personal_finance_in_trading.md), after-tax [income](../i/income.md) helps individuals and households understand their real [disposable income](../d/disposable_income.md). It allows them to:
- **[Budget](../b/budget.md) Effectively**: Knowing how much [money](../m/money.md) is available after [taxes](../t/taxes.md) helps in creating a realistic [budget](../b/budget.md).

### Business Finance

For businesses, after-tax [income](../i/income.md) is critical for assessing profitability and [financial health](../f/financial_health.md). It influences:
- **[Reinvestment](../r/reinvestment.md) Strategies**: Profitable after-tax [income](../i/income.md) allows businesses to reinvest in their operations, research and development, and [expansion](../e/expansion.md) plans.
- **[Investor](../i/investor.md) Decisions**: Investors look at a company's after-tax [income](../i/income.md) to determine [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and potential for growth.
- **[Creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md)**: Banks and other financial institutions assess a companyâ€™s after-tax [income](../i/income.md) when considering loans and [credit](../c/credit.md) lines.

## Calculation of After-Tax Income

### For Individuals

The process of calculating after-tax [income](../i/income.md) for individuals involves the following steps:

1. **[Gross Income](../g/gross_income.md)**: Begin with the total [earnings](../e/earnings.md) before any [taxes](../t/taxes.md) are deducted. This includes wages, salaries, tips, bonuses, and any other form of [income](../i/income.md).
2. **[Federal Income](../f/federal_income.md) Tax**: Subtract the [federal income](../f/federal_income.md) [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md). The amount of [federal income](../f/federal_income.md) tax depends on the individual's tax bracket and [filing status](../f/filing_status.md).
3. **State and Local [Taxes](../t/taxes.md)**: Deduct state and local [income](../i/income.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md), which vary significantly depending on the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md)'s location.
4. **[Social Security](../s/social_security.md) and Medicare [Taxes](../t/taxes.md)**: These are [payroll](../p/payroll.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) collected under the Federal [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) Contributions Act (FICA). They include 6.2% for [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) (up to a wage base limit) and 1.45% for Medicare, with an additional 0.9% Medicare tax for high-[income](../i/income.md) earners.
5. **Other Deductions**: Subtract any other mandatory deductions, such as retirement plan contributions, [health insurance](../h/health_insurance.md) premiums, and union dues.

Thus, the formula for after-tax [income](../i/income.md) for individuals can be represented as:
\[ \text{After-Tax Income} = \text{Gross Income} - (\text{Federal Income Tax} + \text{State and Local Taxes} + \text{[Social Security](../s/social_security.md) and Medicare [Taxes](../t/taxes.md)} + \text{Other Deductions}) \]

### For Businesses

Calculating after-tax [income](../i/income.md) for businesses involves several steps:

1. **Gross [Revenue](../r/revenue.md)**: Start with the total [revenue](../r/revenue.md) earned from [business](../b/business.md) operations.
2. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: Subtract the direct costs attributable to the production of goods sold by the company.
3. **Operating Expenses**: Deduct operating expenses such as [payroll](../p/payroll.md), rent, utilities, and [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md).
4. **[Interest](../i/interest.md) Expenses**: Subtract [interest](../i/interest.md) paid on any [business](../b/business.md) loans.
5. **[Income](../i/income.md) Before [Taxes](../t/taxes.md)**: This is calculated as gross [revenue](../r/revenue.md) minus COGS, operating expenses, and [interest](../i/interest.md) expenses.
6. **Corporate [Income Tax](../i/income_tax.md)**: Subtract the amount of corporate [income tax](../i/income_tax.md) owed. The [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md) depends on the jurisdiction and specific tax regulations.

Therefore, the formula for after-tax [income](../i/income.md) for businesses is:
\[ \text{After-Tax Income} = \text{Gross Revenue} - (\text{COGS} + \text{Operating Expenses} + \text{Interest Expenses} + \text{Corporate [Income Tax](../i/income_tax.md)}) \]

## Differences between Individual and Business After-Tax Income

While the fundamental concept of after-tax [income](../i/income.md) is similar for individuals and businesses, there are several key differences:

### Income Sources
- **Individuals**: Primarily include wages, salaries, tips, and [investment income](../i/investment_income.md).
- **Businesses**: Include sales [revenue](../r/revenue.md), service [income](../i/income.md), and other forms of [business](../b/business.md)-generated [income](../i/income.md).

### Tax Deductions and Credits
- **Individuals**: Include standard deductions, itemized deductions, and various tax credits like [earned income](../e/earned_income.md) [tax credit](../t/tax_credit.md) (EITC), [child tax credit](../c/child_tax_credit.md) (CTC), and educational credits.
- **Businesses**: Include a wide [range](../r/range.md) of deductions such as [business](../b/business.md) expenses, [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md), carryover losses, and tax credits for research and development, energy [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md), etc.

### Tax Rates
- **Individuals**: [Federal income](../f/federal_income.md) tax rates are progressive, meaning higher [income](../i/income.md) is taxed at higher rates. State tax rates also vary.
- **Businesses**: [Corporate tax](../c/corporate_tax.md) rates tend to be flat or vary within a narrow [range](../r/range.md) depending on the jurisdiction. The U.S. federal [corporate tax](../c/corporate_tax.md) rate, for example, is a flat rate of 21% as of 2023.

## Impact on Investment Decisions

After-tax [income](../i/income.md) plays a crucial role in investment decision-making for both individuals and businesses.

### Individuals

For individuals, the amount of after-tax [income](../i/income.md) directly affects the capacity to invest. Smaller after-tax incomes limit the available funds for investment, thereby influencing:

- **[Risk Tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md)**: With limited after-tax [income](../i/income.md), individuals may lean towards safer, low-[risk](../r/risk.md) investments.
- **[Asset Allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md)**: Individuals with higher after-tax incomes can diversify their investment portfolios by allocating funds across various [asset](../a/asset.md) classes such as [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), and alternative investments.
- **Investment Goals**: After-tax [income](../i/income.md) impacts the ability to meet long-term financial goals such as retirement, education funding, and purchasing a [home](../h/home.md).

### Businesses

For businesses, after-tax [income](../i/income.md) is fundamental to decision-making on [reinvestment](../r/reinvestment.md) and growth strategies:

- **[Capital](../c/capital.md) Expenditures**: Higher after-tax [income](../i/income.md) allows for more significant [capital](../c/capital.md) expenditures, including new machinery, technology upgrades, and [expansion](../e/expansion.md).
- **Research and Development**: Businesses with substantial after-tax [income](../i/income.md) can invest in research and development to foster innovation and stay competitive.
- **Stock Buybacks and Dividends**: Companies with high after-tax [income](../i/income.md) may choose to buy back [shares](../s/shares.md) or distribute dividends to shareholders.
- **Mergers and Acquisitions**: Sufficient after-tax [income](../i/income.md) gives businesses the financial cushion needed to pursue mergers and acquisitions for [expansion](../e/expansion.md) and [market penetration](../m/market_penetration.md).

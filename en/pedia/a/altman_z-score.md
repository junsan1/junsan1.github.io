# Altman Z-Score

The Altman [Z-Score](../z/z-score.md) is a financial formula that calculates the likelihood of a company facing [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) within two years. Developed by Edward I. Altman in 1968, this formula integrates various [financial ratios](../f/financial_ratios.md) to quantify a [firm](../f/firm.md)'s [financial health](../f/financial_health.md). It's typically used by investors, financial analysts, and portfolio managers to assess the [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) of different companies. The Altman [Z-Score](../z/z-score.md) has evolved over the years and now includes different versions for public companies, private companies, and non-[manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) companies.

## Components of the Altman Z-Score

The Altman [Z-Score](../z/z-score.md) employs five key [financial ratios](../f/financial_ratios.md) that collectively provide insight into different aspects of a company's financial stability:

1. **Working [Capital](../c/capital.md)/Total Assets (WC/TA)**: This ratio measures the proportion of total assets that is tied up in working [capital](../c/capital.md). Working [capital](../c/capital.md) is calculated as [current assets](../c/current_assets.md) minus [current liabilities](../c/current_liabilities.md). A higher ratio suggests that the [firm](../f/firm.md) has a good short-term [financial health](../f/financial_health.md).

2. **[Retained Earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md)/Total Assets (RE/TA)**: This ratio indicates how much of the company's assets are financed by [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md). [Retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md) are the cumulative amount of [profit](../p/profit.md) kept in the company rather than paid out as dividends. A higher ratio implies a more financially stable [business](../b/business.md) with a strong history of profitability.

3. **[Earnings](../e/earnings.md) Before [Interest](../i/interest.md) and [Taxes](../t/taxes.md)/Total Assets (EBIT/TA)**: This ratio assesses the [firm](../f/firm.md)'s operating [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md). It compares the [earnings](../e/earnings.md) before [interest](../i/interest.md) and [taxes](../t/taxes.md) (EBIT) to the total assets, revealing how well the company is utilizing its assets to generate profits from its core operations.

4. **[Market Value of Equity](../m/market_value_of_equity.md)/[Total Liabilities](../t/total_liabilities.md) (MVE/TL)**: This ratio measures the extent to which a [firm](../f/firm.md)’s assets can decline in [value](../v/value.md) before the liabilities exceed the assets. [Market value of equity](../m/market_value_of_equity.md) is the total [market value](../m/market_value.md) of all outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md), and [total liabilities](../t/total_liabilities.md) are the sum of current and [long-term liabilities](../l/long-term_liabilities.md). A higher ratio suggests a lower [risk](../r/risk.md) of [insolvency](../i/insolvency.md).

5. **Sales/Total Assets (S/TA)**: This ratio measures the [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) of the [firm](../f/firm.md)'s [asset](../a/asset.md) use in generating [revenue](../r/revenue.md). A higher ratio indicates that the company is effectively using its assets to generate sales.

## Calculation of Altman Z-Score

The original [Z-Score](../z/z-score.md) formula for public [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) companies is as follows:

```
Z = 1.2(WC/TA) + 1.4(RE/TA) + 3.3(EBIT/TA) + 0.6(MVE/TL) + 1.0(S/TA)
```

Each ratio is multiplied by a standard coefficient, which was statistically determined by Altman to have predictive power for assessing [financial distress](../f/financial_distress.md). After computing the [weighted](../w/weighted.md) sum of these ratios, the resulting [Z-Score](../z/z-score.md) can be interpreted as follows:

- **Z > 2.99**: The company is considered to be healthy and not likely to enter [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md).
- **1.81 < Z < 2.99**: The company is in a grey zone; the financial status is uncertain and should be monitored.
- **Z < 1.81**: The company is likely to go bankrupt.

## Modified Z-Score for Non-Manufacturing and Private Companies

Because the original model was devised primarily for publicly traded [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) companies, adjustments were needed for its application to other sectors. Altman developed alternative models for non-[manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) and private firms.

### Non-Manufacturing Companies

The modified formula for non-[manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) firms removes the Sales/Total Assets component:

```
Z = 6.56(WC/TA) + 3.26(RE/TA) + 6.72(EBIT/TA) + 1.05(MVE/TL)
```

### Private Firms

For privately held companies, the [Market Value of Equity](../m/market_value_of_equity.md) is not readily available, so the [book value](../b/book_value.md) of [equity](../e/equity.md) is used instead:

```
Z = 0.717(WC/TA) + 0.847(RE/TA) + 3.107(EBIT/TA) + 0.42(BVE/TL) + 0.998(S/TA)
```

Where `BVE` stands for the [Book Value](../b/book_value.md) of [Equity](../e/equity.md).

## Historical Performance and Limitations

The Altman [Z-Score](../z/z-score.md) has proven to be highly effective historically, with early tests showing an accuracy of approximately 72% two years prior to [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md). It was able to identify companies that would [fail](../f/fail.md) within this period but also produced some false positives and false negatives. While the formula remains a useful tool, it has some limitations:

- **[Industry](../i/industry.md)-Specific Factors**: The formula may not account for [industry](../i/industry.md)-specific financial characteristics and [market](../m/market.md) conditions that could affect the reliability of the [Z-Score](../z/z-score.md).
- **[Economic Conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md)**: Broader economic factors, such as economic downturns or booms, might not be fully reflected in the static [financial ratios](../f/financial_ratios.md).
- **[Accounting](../a/accounting.md) Practices**: Differences in [accounting policies](../a/accounting_policies.md) between firms can introduce bias into the [financial ratios](../f/financial_ratios.md) and affect the [Z-Score](../z/z-score.md).
- **Time Lag**: [Financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) are retrospective, and any significant events occurring after their publication won't be captured in the [Z-Score](../z/z-score.md).

## Application in Modern Finance

Despite its limitations, the Altman [Z-Score](../z/z-score.md) remains widely utilized in [credit](../c/credit.md) assessments, investment screening, and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md). Its role has been particularly noted in the realms of leveraged [finance](../f/finance.md) and [high-yield bond](../h/high-yield_bond.md) markets, where the financial fragility of firms is a critical concern.

### Use by Financial Firms

Several financial institutions include the Altman [Z-Score](../z/z-score.md) in their [credit](../c/credit.md) analysis toolkits:

- **Moody’s Analytics**: The global [finance](../f/finance.md) and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) [firm](../f/firm.md) incorporates the Altman [Z-Score](../z/z-score.md) in its [Credit Risk](../c/credit_risk.md) Calculator. [Moody's Analytics](https://www.moodysanalytics.com)
- **S&P Global**: Known for its [credit](../c/credit.md) ratings, S&P Global uses the [Z-Score](../z/z-score.md) as one of many metrics in assessing the [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) of an [issuer](../i/issuer.md). [S&P Global](https://www.spglobal.com)

### Academic and Educational Influence

Universities and financial education programs frequently teach the Altman [Z-Score](../z/z-score.md) as part of their curriculum on [financial statement analysis](../f/financial_statement_analysis.md) and [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md). Its clear methodology and straightforward computation make it an excellent teaching tool for understanding the core concepts of [financial risk](../f/financial_risk.md) and profitability.

## Conclusion

The Altman [Z-Score](../z/z-score.md) is an essential tool in [financial risk](../f/financial_risk.md) assessment, [offering](../o/offering.md) a quantitative measure of a company’s likelihood of [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md). By combining [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [financial ratios](../f/financial_ratios.md) into a single score, it provides a more comprehensive view of [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) than any single ratio alone. While it has some limitations and should be used in conjunction with other analytic tools and professional judgement, it continues to be a valuable part of the toolkit for investors, analysts, and financial managers globally.

# Absorption Costing

Absorption costing, also known as [full costing](../f/full_costing.md), is a [managerial accounting](../m/managerial_accounting.md) method that captures all costs associated with [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) a particular product. This includes both variable costs, such as [raw materials](../r/raw_materials.md) and direct labor, and fixed costs, such as various overhead charges like rent and utilities. This comprehensive approach to costing dovetails with the concept of "absorption" in that it absorbs all expenses related to production, attributing them to the product.

## Key Components of Absorption Costing

Absorption costing includes several critical components that fully realize the total cost of [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md). These components include:

### Direct Costs

**Direct Materials**: These are [raw materials](../r/raw_materials.md) that can be directly traced to the finished product. For instance, in the [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) of wooden furniture, timber would be considered a direct material.

**Direct Labor**: Labor costs incurred that can be directly attributed to the production of specific goods. This involves wages paid to workers who are directly involved in the [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) process, such as machine operators in a factory.

### Indirect Costs

**Variable [Manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) Overheads**: These are the indirect costs that vary with production [volume](../v/volume.md). Examples include [utility](../u/utility.md) costs, indirect materials, and indirect labor.

**Fixed [Manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) Overheads**: These are indirect costs that remain constant irrespective of the [volume](../v/volume.md) of production. They include rent, [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md), and salaried personnel who are not directly involved in production.

### Allocating Overheads

Absorption costing requires overhead costs to be allocated to products, usually based on a predetermined [overhead rate](../o/overhead_rate.md). This rate can be derived through various bases such as direct labor hours, machine hours, or direct labor cost. The allocation ensures that every unit of product manufactured is assigned a portion of both variable and fixed overheads.

## Calculation under Absorption Costing

The formula for absorption costing can be broken down as follows:

\[ \text{Total Absorption Cost} = \text{Direct Materials} + \text{Direct Labor} + \text{Variable [Manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) Overhead} + \text{Fixed [Manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) Overhead} \]

To allocate the fixed [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) overheads:

\[ \text{Predetermined Overhead Rate} = \frac{\text{Total [Manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) Overhead Costs}}{\text{Total Units of Allocation Base}} \]

The allocated fixed [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) overhead per unit is then:

\[ \text{Allocated Fixed [Manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) Overhead per Unit} = \text{Predetermined [Overhead Rate](../o/overhead_rate.md)} \times \text{Units of Allocation Base per Unit} \]

## Example

Let's consider a company, XYZ Furniture, which manufactures chairs. Suppose the following costs are associated with [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) one unit of chair:

- Direct Materials: $50
- Direct Labor: $30
- Variable [Manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) Overhead: $10
- Fixed [Manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) Overhead: $200,000 (annually)
- Production [Volume](../v/volume.md): 10,000 chairs per year

First, calculate the predetermined [overhead rate](../o/overhead_rate.md):

\[ \text{Predetermined Overhead Rate} = \frac{\text{Total Fixed [Manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) Overhead}}{\text{Total Production [Volume](../v/volume.md)}} = \frac{200,000}{10,000} = \$20 \]

Using this [overhead rate](../o/overhead_rate.md), the allocated fixed [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) overhead per unit would be $20. Hence, the total absorption cost per unit of chair is:

\[ \text{Total Absorption Cost per Unit} = \$50 + \$30 + \$10 + \$20 = \$110 \]

## Pros and Cons of Absorption Costing

### Advantages

1. **[Full Costing](../f/full_costing.md)**: Provides a complete picture of the cost structure, including both variable and fixed costs.
2. **GAAP Compliance**: Generally Accepted [Accounting Principles](../a/accounting_principles.md) (GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) require absorption costing for external reporting.
3. **[Inventory](../i/inventory.md) [Valuation](../v/valuation.md)**: Facilitates an accurate [valuation](../v/valuation.md) of [inventory](../i/inventory.md), since it includes fixed [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) overheads.

### Disadvantages

1. **Complexity**: The method can be complex and time-consuming, particularly in allocating overheads.
2. **Cost Behavior**: It does not distinguish between fixed and variable costs, which can be misleading for decision making.
3. **Overproduction Incentives**: May encourage overproduction since increasing [inventory](../i/inventory.md) levels can defer the recognition of certain fixed overhead costs.

## Absorption Costing vs. Variable Costing

Unlike absorption costing, variable costing (or direct costing) includes only variable [production costs](../p/production_costs.md) (direct materials, direct labor, and variable [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) overhead) in the product cost. Fixed [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) overhead is treated as a period cost, which is expensed in the period incurred. Here is a comparison:

### Differences

1. **Cost Inclusion**:
   - Absorption Costing: Includes both variable and fixed [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) costs.
   - Variable Costing: Includes only variable [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) costs.

2. **Fixed Overhead Treatment**:
   - Absorption Costing: Fixed overheads are allocated to products and included in [inventory](../i/inventory.md) costs.
   - Variable Costing: Fixed overheads are treated as period costs and expensed in the period incurred.

3. **[Profit](../p/profit.md) Reporting**:
   - Absorption Costing: Generally shows higher profits when production exceeds sales because some fixed overheads are included in [inventory](../i/inventory.md).
   - Variable Costing: [Profit](../p/profit.md) is more closely associated with sales [volume](../v/volume.md) rather than production [volume](../v/volume.md).

### Example (Continuing with XYZ Furniture)

If XYZ Furniture uses variable costing:

- Direct Materials: $50
- Direct Labor: $30
- Variable [Manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) Overhead: $10
- Fixed [Manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) Overhead: $200,000 (period cost)

Total [variable cost](../v/variable_cost.md) per unit = $50 + $30 + $10 = $90. Fixed [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) overhead of $200,000 is expensed as a period cost, not allocated to each unit.

### Impact on Financial Statements

**[Income Statement](../i/income_statement.md) under Absorption Costing**:

- Sales (10,000 units @ $150 each): $1,500,000
- Less: Cost of Goods Sold (10,000 units @ $110 each): $1,100,000
- [Gross Profit](../g/gross_profit.md): $400,000
- Less: Selling and [Administrative Expenses](../a/administrative_expenses.md): $150,000
- [Operating Profit](../o/operating_profit.md): $250,000

**[Income Statement](../i/income_statement.md) under Variable Costing**:

- Sales (10,000 units @ $150 each): $1,500,000
- Less: [Variable Cost](../v/variable_cost.md) of Goods Sold (10,000 units @ $90 each): $900,000
- [Contribution Margin](../c/contribution_margin.md): $600,000
- Less: Fixed [Manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) Overhead: $200,000
- Less: Selling and [Administrative Expenses](../a/administrative_expenses.md): $150,000
- [Operating Profit](../o/operating_profit.md): $250,000

Despite the different methodologies, the overall [operating profit](../o/operating_profit.md) is the same for both methods when entire production is sold, but this may vary with changes in [inventory](../i/inventory.md) levels.

## Industry Practices and Applications

Absorption costing is widely adopted across various industries due to its compliance with external reporting standards. Many publicly traded companies use this method to align with regulatory requirements and provide comprehensive insight into their cost structures.

### Real-World Example: Caterpillar Inc.

# Actuarial Gain Or Loss

In the world of [actuarial science](../a/actuarial_science.md) and [financial accounting](../f/financial_accounting.md), the terms "actuarial [gain](../g/gain.md) or loss" represent significant concepts, particularly in the context of pensions and other post-employment benefits. These gains and losses reflect the changes in the projected [obligations](../o/obligation.md) and assets associated with actuarial valuations — estimates used to determine the funding requirements for future liabilities.

## What is Actuarial Gain or Loss?

Actuarial [gain](../g/gain.md) or loss occurs due to changes in the assumptions or experiences that are used to calculate the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of a company's pension [obligations](../o/obligation.md) and the [value](../v/value.md) of [pension plan](../p/pension_plan.md) assets. These assumptions can include factors such as [life expectancy](../l/life_expectancy.md), employee [turnover](../t/turnover.md), salary growth, [discount](../d/discount.md) rates, and the [rate of return](../r/rate_of_return.md) on plan assets. 

### Actuarial Assumptions

Actuarial assumptions are predictions about future events that [will](../w/will.md) affect the projected benefit obligation (PBO) of a company's [pension plan](../p/pension_plan.md). Key assumptions include:

1. **[Discount Rate](../d/discount_rate.md)**: The [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) used to determine the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of future pension [obligations](../o/obligation.md).
2. **Salary Growth Rate**: The expected increase in employee salaries over time.
3. **Mortality Rate**: The rate at which [pension plan](../p/pension_plan.md) participants are expected to die.
4. **Employee [Turnover](../t/turnover.md)**: The rate at which employees are expected to leave the company before retirement.
5. **[Rate of Return](../r/rate_of_return.md) on Plan Assets**: The [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) on the investments in the [pension plan](../p/pension_plan.md).

### Causes of Actuarial Gain or Loss

1. **Experience Adjustments**: These are the differences between the actual outcomes and what was previously assumed. For example, if more employees retire earlier than expected, this might result in an actuarial loss because the pension benefits [will](../w/will.md) need to be paid out for a longer time.
2. **Changes in Assumptions**: Updates to the actuarial assumptions based on new information or trends can cause gains or losses. For example, if the [discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md) decreases, the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of pension [obligations](../o/obligation.md) increases, often leading to an actuarial loss.
3. **Investment Returns**: Differences between the actual returns on plan assets and the expected returns can result in actuarial gains or losses.

## Accounting for Actuarial Gains and Losses

### Pension Plans

Under [accounting](../a/accounting.md) standards such as International [Accounting](../a/accounting.md) Standard (IAS) 19 and the [Financial Accounting](../f/financial_accounting.md) Standards Board (FASB) codification, actuarial gains and losses are recognized in various ways:

1. **Immediate Recognition in [Profit](../p/profit.md) or Loss**: Some companies may choose or are required to recognize actuarial gains or losses immediately in the company's [profit](../p/profit.md) or loss statement. This approach can result in significant [volatility](../v/volatility.md) in reported [earnings](../e/earnings.md).
2. **Recognition in Other [Comprehensive Income](../c/comprehensive_income.md) (OCI)**: Companies may also recognize actuarial gains and losses in Other [Comprehensive Income](../c/comprehensive_income.md), bypassing the [profit](../p/profit.md) or loss statement, and reflecting these changes directly in [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) [equity](../e/equity.md).
3. **Amortization through Corridor Approach**: Under this method, only the actuarial gains or losses that exceed a certain threshold (usually a percentage of the greater of the pension obligation or plan assets) are gradually amortized into [profit](../p/profit.md) or loss over time.

### Impact on Financial Statements

The treatment of actuarial gains and losses can have significant impacts on a company's [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) and key [financial ratios](../f/financial_ratios.md). Immediate recognition can result in considerable fluctuations in net [income](../i/income.md), while recognition through OCI affects an entity’s [equity](../e/equity.md) without impacting net [income](../i/income.md) directly.

## Real World Examples

### Major Corporations 

Organizations with significant defined benefit pension plans, such as General Electric, Ford, and IBM, regularly encounter actuarial gains and losses. These changes are typically detailed in their annual [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md). Companies provide detailed disclosures about the actuarial assumptions used, the impact of experience adjustments, and the changes in financial assumptions that have influenced the actuarial gains or losses recognized for the period.

### Financial Disclosures

To observe the application of [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for actuarial gains and losses, one can look into the financial disclosures of companies. For example:

- **General Electric (GE)**: Provides detailed information on pension [obligations](../o/obligation.md) and the assumptions used in their [annual report](../a/annual_report.md), available on their [official website](https://www.ge.com/investor-relations).
- **IBM**: Discusses the impact of actuarial gains and losses on their [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) in their annual reports, accessible via their [investor relations page](https://www.ibm.com/investor/).

## The Role of Actuaries

Actuaries play a crucial role in valuing pension plans and calculating the actuarial gains or losses. They employ mathematical and statistical techniques to make predictions about future events, utilizing historical data and trends. Actuaries must comply with professional standards and often work alongside accountants and financial analysts to ensure that the actuarial assumptions and valuations are accurate and appropriate.

### Professional Organizations 

Several professional organizations provide guidelines and standards for actuaries, such as:
- **The Society of Actuaries (SOA)**
- **The Institute and Faculty of Actuaries (IFoA)**
- **The American Academy of Actuaries ([AAA](../a/aaa.md))**

These organizations also [offer](../o/offer.md) resources, continuing education, and support for actuarial professionals to stay current with the [best practices](../b/best_practices.md) and emerging trends in the field.

## Summary

Actuarial gains and losses are critical components in the financial management of pension plans and other post-employment benefits. They arise from changes in actuarial assumptions or differences between expected and actual experiences. The [accounting](../a/accounting.md) treatment of these gains and losses can vary, significantly influencing a company’s [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md). Actuaries play a key role in this process, employing sophisticated models and assumptions to provide accurate valuations and ensure the ongoing adequacy of pension funding.

# Available Balance

The concept of "available balance" in financial terminology generally refers to the amount of [money](../m/money.md) that is readily accessible in a [bank](../b/bank.md) account for [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) or use. This is a vital term for both individual account holders and businesses, including those involved in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) (algo trading). Within the broader [scope](../s/scope.md) of trading and investments, available balance determines how much [capital](../c/capital.md) can be deployed for trading activities without triggering [overdraft](../o/overdraft.md) fees or [margin](../m/margin.md) calls. 

## Components and Calculation

To fully understand the available balance, it's essential to break down its components and the method of its calculation:

1. **[Ledger Balance](../l/ledger_balance.md)**: The [ledger balance](../l/ledger_balance.md), also known as the current balance, includes all recorded transactions up to a specific time. It accounts for deposits, withdrawals, checks, transfers, and any other activities affecting the account.

2. **Pending Transactions**: These include transactions that have been initiated but not yet cleared or settled. Pending transactions [will](../w/will.md) impact the final available balance once they are fully processed.

3. **[Overdraft](../o/overdraft.md) and Linked Accounts**: Some accounts [offer](../o/offer.md) [overdraft protection](../o/overdraft_protection.md) or are linked to other accounts for transferring funds. These features can provide additional [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), thus affecting the available balance.

4. **Holds**: Banks may place holds on deposited checks or suspicious transactions to ensure funds' authenticity. Such holds temporarily reduce the available balance until they are lifted.

5. **[Credit](../c/credit.md) Lines**: For [margin](../m/margin.md) accounts or those with lines of [credit](../c/credit.md), the available balance might also include accessible borrowed funds, although these come with specific borrowing costs.

The formula for calculating the available balance is:

```
Available Balance = [Ledger Balance](../l/ledger_balance.md) - Pending Withdrawals - Holds + [Overdraft Protection](../o/overdraft_protection.md)/Linked Account Transfers
```

## Significance in Algorithmic Trading

Available balance is particularly significant in the realm of [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) for several reasons:

1. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Having an accurate understanding of the available balance helps in managing exposure and preventing unwanted consequences, like [margin](../m/margin.md) calls which can result in forced [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md) of assets.

2. **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)**: [Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) thrives on [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md). Ensuring you have an available balance helps meet [trade](../t/trade.md) [execution](../e/execution.md) needs quickly and efficiently without delays due to [insufficient funds](../i/insufficient_funds.md).

3. **Automation**: Automated systems must access the correct available balance to make trading decisions that align with an account's actual capacity to execute trades. Misestimating this can lead to system errors or failed trades.

## Techniques and Tools for Monitoring Available Balance

To maintain a clear picture of the available balance, several techniques and tools can be employed:

1. **Real-time Monitoring Software**: Various financial platforms [offer](../o/offer.md) real-time tracking of transactions and available balances. Tools like [Bloomberg Terminal](../b/bloomberg_terminal.md), MetaTrader, and others [offer](../o/offer.md) this functionality.

2. **API Integrations**: Algo traders can integrate their [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) with banking and brokerage APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to dynamically pull available balance data. For example, the [Interactive Brokers](../i/interactive_brokers.md) API allows for real-time balance checks and trading through automated systems (https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/api.php).

3. **Alerts and Notifications**: Setting up alerts for low balances or unusual transactions can help detect issues promptly. Services provided by platforms such as TD [Ameritrade](../a/ameritrade.md) allow for setting up custom notifications (https://www.tdameritrade.com/tools-and-platforms/thinkorswim/features.page).

## Factors Influencing Available Balance

Several factors can influence the available balance in a trading context:

1. **[Market](../m/market.md) Conditions**: Volatile markets may lead to significant price swings affecting the required [margin](../m/margin.md) and, subsequently, the available balance.

2. **Regulatory Changes**: Financial regulations such as the Dodd-Frank Act in the United States or [MiFID II](../m/mifid_ii.md) in Europe may impose requirements impacting how balance and [margin](../m/margin.md) are calculated.

3. **Brokerage Policies**: Different brokers have distinct policies regarding how soon deposited funds become available for trading and how pending transactions are treated.

4. **[Currency Exchange](../c/currency_exchange.md) Rates**: For international traders, [currency](../c/currency.md) fluctuations can impact the available balance when conversions are needed.

## Example Scenario in Algo Trading

Consider an algorithmic [trader](../t/trader.md) using a [brokerage account](../b/brokerage_account.md) linked to their automated trading system. Here's a practical scenario of how available balance might play a role:

1. **Initial Setup**: The [trader](../t/trader.md) deposits $100,000 into the [brokerage account](../b/brokerage_account.md).
   
2. **Real-time API Integration**: Their algorithm integrates with the brokerage API and periodically queries the available balance.

3. **[Trade](../t/trade.md) [Execution](../e/execution.md)**: The algorithm identifies a trading opportunity requiring $50,000. It checks the available balance to ensure adequate funds.

4. **Pending [Transaction](../t/transaction.md)**: A pending [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) of $10,000 exists. The [ledger balance](../l/ledger_balance.md) shows $100,000, but the available balance, [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for the pending [transaction](../t/transaction.md), is $90,000.

5. **[Execution](../e/execution.md) Decision**: Seeing that $90,000 is sufficient, the algorithm proceeds with the $50,000 [trade](../t/trade.md). Post-[trade](../t/trade.md), it recalculates the available balance to be $40,000.

6. **[Hold](../h/hold.md) Notice**: The [bank](../b/bank.md) places a $5,000 [hold](../h/hold.md) on some funds due to a suspicious [transaction](../t/transaction.md) alert, adjusting the available balance further.

The above scenario underscores the critical importance of continuously monitoring the available balance to avoid over-leveraging or [trade](../t/trade.md) failures.

## Conclusion

In summation, the available balance is a crucial figure in both everyday banking and the realm of [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md). Accurate monitoring and understanding of this balance enable better financial management, efficient trading operations, and effective [risk](../r/risk.md) mitigation. Advanced tools and automated systems can aid significantly in real-time tracking and smart decision-making, fostering more successful trading endeavors. Algorithmic traders must continually adapt and stay informed about factors influencing their available balances to maintain a competitive and secure [trading environment](../t/trading_environment.md).

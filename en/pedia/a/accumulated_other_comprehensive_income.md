# Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

Accumulated Other [Comprehensive Income](../c/comprehensive_income.md) (AOCI), also known as Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, is an [equity](../e/equity.md) account that represents the cumulative changes in other [comprehensive income](../c/comprehensive_income.md) for an entity. Unlike net [income](../i/income.md), which reflects a company's profitability and is reported on the [income statement](../i/income_statement.md), other [comprehensive income](../c/comprehensive_income.md) (OCI) encompasses components of [comprehensive income](../c/comprehensive_income.md) that are excluded from net [income](../i/income.md). These are generally non-operational gains and losses that have not been realized and therefore do not immediately impact the [income statement](../i/income_statement.md).

[Comprehensive income](../c/comprehensive_income.md) includes all changes in [equity](../e/equity.md) during a period except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. OCI is a part of [comprehensive income](../c/comprehensive_income.md) but is reported separately from net [income](../i/income.md). Once items initially in OCI are realized, they are reclassified out of OCI and into the [income statement](../i/income_statement.md).

## Components of Other Comprehensive Income

There is a wide [range](../r/range.md) of components that can be included in OCI, depending on the type of [business](../b/business.md) and the specific financial activities it engages in. Typical components include:

### 1. Unrealized Gains and Losses on Available-for-Sale Securities
Available-for-[sale](../s/sale.md) securities are those that are not classified as either trading securities (which are meant for active buying and selling) or held-to-[maturity](../m/maturity.md) securities (which are kept until they mature). [Unrealized gains](../u/unrealized_gains.md) and losses on these securities are excluded from net [income](../i/income.md) until they are realized, and are instead reported in OCI.

### 2. Gains and Losses on Derivative Instruments Designated as Cash Flow Hedges
Companies often use [derivative](../d/derivative.md) instruments such as [options](../o/options.md), [futures](../f/futures.md), and swaps to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against risks like fluctuations in [currency exchange](../c/currency_exchange.md) rates or [commodity](../c/commodity.md) prices. When these [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) are designated as [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) hedges, the [unrealized gains](../u/unrealized_gains.md) or losses accumulate in OCI until the hedged [transaction](../t/transaction.md) affects [earnings](../e/earnings.md).

### 3. Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments
For multinational corporations, the process of consolidating foreign subsidiary [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) involves converting their financials from the local [currency](../c/currency.md) to the reporting [currency](../c/currency.md). The gains or losses resulting from this [currency](../c/currency.md) translation are accumulated in OCI.

### 4. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plan Adjustments
Changes in the funded status of defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, due to factors like changes in actuarial assumptions or differences between expected and actual returns, are recognized in OCI. Over time, these amounts are amortized and moved to net [income](../i/income.md).

## Reporting in Financial Statements

### Balance Sheet
AOCI is reported in the [equity](../e/equity.md) section of the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md), separate from [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md). It is an [aggregation](../a/aggregation.md) of the accumulated OCI items that have occurred over the periods.

### Statement of Comprehensive Income
The statement of [comprehensive income](../c/comprehensive_income.md) expands the traditional [income statement](../i/income_statement.md) by detailing net [income](../i/income.md) and components of other [comprehensive income](../c/comprehensive_income.md) to arrive at [comprehensive income](../c/comprehensive_income.md). Companies may present it in one of two formats:

1. A single continuous statement of [comprehensive income](../c/comprehensive_income.md) that includes both net [income](../i/income.md) and OCI components.
2. Two separate but consecutive statements: an [income statement](../i/income_statement.md) followed by a statement of [comprehensive income](../c/comprehensive_income.md).

### Statement of Changes in Equity
The statement of changes in [equity](../e/equity.md) [will](../w/will.md) also reflect changes in AOCI accounts, detailing the accumulation from the beginning to the end of the period.

## Importance for Investors and Analysts

Understanding AOCI is crucial for investors and analysts as it provides a fuller picture of a company's [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) by revealing the economic impacts of activities excluded from net [income](../i/income.md). AOCI can provide insight into:

- **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md):** Companies' strategies for managing financial risks through [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) or other financial instruments.
- **Foreign Operations Impact:** How changes in [currency exchange](../c/currency_exchange.md) rates impact multinational companies.
- **Pension [Obligations](../o/obligation.md):** The long-term implications of pension and postretirement benefits on a company's resources.

## Regulatory and Accounting Standards

### International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
Under IFRS, other [comprehensive income](../c/comprehensive_income.md) is defined similarly and accumulated as a separate component of [equity](../e/equity.md). However, IFRS does not use the term "AOCI."

### Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)
In the United States, GAAP provides specific [guidance](../g/guidance.md) for reporting OCI and AOCI. Companies are required to clearly distinguish these components in their [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md).

## Conclusion

Accumulated Other [Comprehensive Income](../c/comprehensive_income.md) offers a broader perspective on a company's overall [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) and health. It includes important but non-operational items that could significantly impact the future profitability and [risk](../r/risk.md) profile of the company. Understanding AOCI helps stakeholders better evaluate the true economic impact of various [business activities](../b/business_activities.md) beyond what is reported in net [income](../i/income.md).

# Algorithmic Trading with C++

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), also known as automated trading, utilizes algorithms and mathematical models to make trading decisions and execute orders. The primary goal is to optimize trades in terms of profit, speed, and frequency, all while minimizing human intervention and potential errors. C++ is one of the most preferred programming languages for [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) due to its performance efficiency, low latency, and robust library support.

## Why C++?

### Performance and Speed
C++ is known for its high performance and low-level memory manipulation capabilities. The language allows for direct interaction with the hardware, maximizing the speed and performance of [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) which is crucial in high-frequency trading environments.

### Low Latency
In the trading world, every millisecond counts. C++ provides low-latency execution, which is essential for executing numerous trades in a very short amount of time. This low latency is achieved through compiled binary code and optimized algorithms, making C++ a go-to choice for many financial institutions.

### Libraries and Tools
C++ boasts a broad array of libraries useful for various aspects of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), including data manipulation, statistical analysis, and machine learning. Some of the widely used libraries include Boost, [QuantLib](../q/quantlib.md), and Eigen.

- **Boost**: This is a collection of libraries that extend the functionality of C++. Functions relevant to [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) include data structures, algorithms, and numerical computing.
- **[QuantLib](../q/quantlib.md)**: This open-source library provides tools for modeling, [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), and pricing financial instruments.
- **Eigen**: A C++ template library for linear algebra, Eigen is highly useful for [quantitative finance](../q/quantitative_finance.md) applications involving mathematical calculations.

## Fundamentals of Algorithmic Trading

### Market Data
Market data is the cornerstone of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). It includes information such as stock prices, trade volumes, and order book data. Efficient handling and analysis of this large volume of data require optimized algorithms and data structures provided by C++.

### Trading Strategies
[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) can employ various strategies, including but not limited to:

- **Statistical [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**: This involves exploiting the mean-reverting behavior of asset prices using statistical and mathematical models.
- **Market Making**: This strategy uses algorithms to provide liquidity to the market by continuously buying and selling assets, thus capturing the [bid-ask spread](../b/bid-ask_spread.md).
- **[Momentum Trading](../m/momentum_trading.md)**: This strategy aims to capitalize on market trends by going long on rising assets and short on falling ones.
- **[Mean Reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md)**: This strategy is based on the assumption that asset prices will revert to their historical average over time.

### Execution Algorithms
These algorithms focus on the optimal execution of orders by minimizing market impact and ensuring the best possible price. Examples include:

- **VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)**: An algorithm that breaks down a large order into smaller pieces and executes them over time to achieve the average market price.
- **TWAP (Time Weighted Average Price)**: This algorithm executes trades evenly over a specified time period.
- **Implementation Shortfall**: Aims to minimize the difference between the market price when the decision to trade was made and when the trade was actually executed.

## Code Structure in C++

### Data Structures
Efficient data structures are crucial for the rapid processing of market data and execution of trades. Commonly used data structures include:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

struct Order {
    int orderId;
    std::string instrument;
    double price;
    int quantity;
    char side; // 'B' for buy, 'S' for sell
};

std::vector<Order> orderBook;
std::queue<Order> orderQueue;
std::map<std::string, double> marketData;
```

### Algorithms and Models
[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) involves various mathematical and statistical models. C++ allows for the implementation of these models efficiently.

#### Example: Moving Average Crossover Strategy

```cpp
#include <numeric>

// Function to calculate the moving average
double movingAverage(const std::vector<double>& prices, int period) {
    if(prices.size() < period) return 0.0;
    double sum = std::accumulate(prices.end() - period, prices.end(), 0.0);
    return sum / period;
}

// Signal Generation based on Moving Average Crossover
std::string generateSignal(const std::vector<double>& shortTermPrices, const std::vector<double>& longTermPrices) {
    double shortTermMA = movingAverage(shortTermPrices, 10); // 10-period MA
    double longTermMA = movingAverage(longTermPrices, 50);  // 50-period MA

    if(shortTermMA > longTermMA) {
        return "BUY";
    } else if(shortTermMA < longTermMA) {
        return "SELL";
    }
    return "HOLD";
}
```

### Real-Time Data Handling
Real-time processing is essential for [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). Handling streams of real-time data efficiently is another strength of C++.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void onMarketDataUpdate(const std::string& instrument, double price, int volume) {
    // Update market data
    marketData[instrument] = price;

    // Process new data
    std::cout << "Instrument: " << instrument << ", Price: " << price << ", Volume: " << volume << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    // Simulate [real-time market data](../r/real-time_market_data.md)
    onMarketDataUpdate("AAPL", 150.25, 100);
    onMarketDataUpdate("GOOGL", 2720.5, 150);

    return 0;
}
```

## Backtesting Framework

[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) involves testing a trading strategy over historical data to evaluate its effectiveness. A robust [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) framework is vital for any [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) strategy.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

// Historical market data
std::vector<std::pair<std::string, double>> historicalData = {
    {"2023-01-01", 150.0},
    {"2023-01-02", 155.0},
    {"2023-01-03", 145.0},
    // Add more data as needed
};

void backtestStrategy() {
    std::vector<double> shortTermPrices;
    std::vector<double> longTermPrices;

    for (const auto& data : historicalData) {
        shortTermPrices.push_back(data.second);
        longTermPrices.push_back(data.second);

        std::string signal = generateSignal(shortTermPrices, longTermPrices);
        std::cout << "Date: " << data.first << ", Signal: " << signal << std::endl;
    }
}

int main() {
    backtestStrategy();
    return 0;
}
```

## Risk Management

[Risk management](../r/risk_management.md) is a critical aspect of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). Effective [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) strategies are necessary to protect against significant losses.

### Stop-Loss and Take-Profit
These mechanisms automatically sell an asset when it reaches a certain price level, thus capping losses or securing profits.

#### Example Implementation

```cpp
bool checkStopLoss(double buyPrice, double currentPrice, double stopLossPercent) {
    return currentPrice <= buyPrice * (1 - stopLossPercent / 100);
}

bool checkTakeProfit(double buyPrice, double currentPrice, double takeProfitPercent) {
    return currentPrice >= buyPrice * (1 + takeProfitPercent / 100);
}
```

### Position Sizing
[Position sizing](../p/position_sizing.md) determines the number of units to trade based on the risk per trade and the account size. Fixed fractional [position sizing](../p/position_sizing.md) is a common method, where a fixed percentage of the account is risked on each trade.

```cpp
double calculatePositionSize(double accountSize, double riskPerTradePercent, double stopLossAmount) {
    return (accountSize * riskPerTradePercent / 100) / stopLossAmount;
}
```

## Real-World Platforms and APIs

### Interactive Brokers
[Interactive Brokers](../i/interactive_brokers.md) offers a robust API allowing developers to implement custom [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) in C++. The API supports multiple programming languages including C++.

# Asset-Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP)

[Asset](../a/asset.md)-Backed [Commercial Paper](../c/commercial_paper.md) (ABCP) is a short-term [investment vehicle](../i/investment_vehicle.md) with a [maturity](../m/maturity.md) typically ranging from 90 to 270 days. The [asset](../a/asset.md) that backs the [commercial paper](../c/commercial_paper.md) is most often [business](../b/business.md) receivables, [trade](../t/trade.md) receivables, or other debts owed to a [firm](../f/firm.md) issuing the [commercial paper](../c/commercial_paper.md). ABCP is a part of the broader [commercial paper](../c/commercial_paper.md) [market](../m/market.md), which includes unsecured [short-term debt](../s/short-term_debt.md) issued by corporations to meet immediate funding needs. The ABCP [market](../m/market.md) represents a critical component of the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md), [offering](../o/offering.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) to a wide array of financial institutions and investors.

## Introduction to Asset-Backed Commercial Paper

ABCP first emerged as a [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) in the early 1980s. It expanded considerably through the 1990s and early 2000s, reaching a peak before the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) of 2007-2008. The fundamental principle behind ABCP is that it provides short-term [financing](../f/financing.md) to companies, primarily [investment banks](../i/investment_bank_(ib).md) or special-purpose vehicles (SPVs). These entities then utilize the funds to maintain [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) or [finance](../f/finance.md) specific activities, typically related to [asset](../a/asset.md)-backed securities.

### Basic Structure of ABCP

At its core, ABCP is similar to other forms of [commercial paper](../c/commercial_paper.md), but with added [security](../s/security.md) thanks to the backing assets. The typical structure of an ABCP involves an SPV which buys a pool of assets such as mortgages, auto loans, or [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) receivables. The SPV then issues the ABCP to investors, secured by the pool of assets. The investors expect to be paid back from the cash flows generated by the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets.

### Participants in the ABCP Market

Several key players are involved in the ABCP [market](../m/market.md):

1. **Issuers:** These are typically financial firms or SPVs that [issue](../i/issue.md) ABCP to obtain funding.
2. **Investors:** These can be mutual funds, [money market](../m/money_market.md) funds, corporate treasurers, or other entities seeking safe, [short-term investments](../s/short-term_investments.md).
3. **[Credit](../c/credit.md) Enhancers:** To make ABCP more appealing to investors, issuers often employ [credit](../c/credit.md) enhancement mechanisms such as guarantees from highly-rated institutions.
4. **Dealers:** Banks and financial intermediaries act as dealers to distribute the paper.
5. **[Rating](../r/rating.md) Agencies:** Agencies like Moody's, Standard & Poor's, and Fitch rate the [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) of the ABCP, providing [guidance](../g/guidance.md) to investors.

## The Mechanics of Issuing ABCP

The issuance of ABCP follows several steps. First, the sponsor (usually a [bank](../b/bank.md)) establishes an SPV. This SPV [will](../w/will.md) then purchase a diversified portfolio of assets that generate regular cash flows. These assets might include loans, leases, or other receivables. Upon acquiring the assets, the SPV issues ABCP to investors, backed by the pool of assets. The proceeds from this issuance are used to [finance](../f/finance.md) the purchase of more assets or to roll over existing ABCP.

### Credit Enhancement and Liquidity Support

Key aspects that make ABCP attractive are [credit](../c/credit.md) enhancement and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) support. The [credit](../c/credit.md) enhancement is usually provided by the sponsoring [bank](../b/bank.md) and can come in various forms such as letters of [credit](../c/credit.md), overcollateralization, and [insurance](../i/insurance.md) wraps. [Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) support is critical because it assures investors that they can be paid back promptly even if the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets are not [liquid](../l/liquid.md).

## Risks and Challenges of ABCP

While ABCP offers several advantages, including higher [security](../s/security.md) due to [asset](../a/asset.md) backing and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) for issuers, it also comes with significant risks:

### Credit Risk

### Liquidity Risk

### Market Risk

### Structural Risk

### Regulatory Risks

## Historical Context and Market Evolution

ABCP saw substantial growth in the early 2000s but faced severe challenges during the 2007-2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md). The [market](../m/market.md) for ABCP contracted dramatically as concerns over [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-backed assets grew, leading to a loss of confidence and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) problems.

### The Financial Crisis and ABCP

The [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) of 2007-2008 severely impacted the ABCP [market](../m/market.md). Many ABCP programs faced significant stress as the [value](../v/value.md) and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) of the [collateral](../c/collateral.md) backing the paper fell. This led to a reluctance among investors to purchase ABCP, causing a [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) crunch. The crisis highlighted the vulnerability of short-term funding markets to systemic shocks and led to increased scrutiny and regulatory oversight.

### Regulatory Responses and Reforms

Post-crisis, significant regulatory adjustments have been implemented to address the vulnerabilities observed in the ABCP [market](../m/market.md). The Dodd-Frank Act and new guidelines from [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md) have imposed stricter [capital](../c/capital.md) and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) requirements, aimed at increasing [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and reducing [risk](../r/risk.md).

## Advantages of ABCP

Despite the risks, ABCP remains an attractive investment for several reasons:

### Cost-Efficiency

Issuers often find ABCP a cost-effective source of funding compared to other forms of [debt](../d/debt.md) due to its short-term nature and the use of [credit](../c/credit.md) enhancements.

### Diversification

Investors benefit from [diversification](../d/diversification.md) due to the wide array of assets that typically back ABCP, which can [range](../r/range.md) from consumer loans to [trade](../t/trade.md) receivables.

### Liquidity

ABCP offers a high degree of [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), particularly for institutional investors and [money market](../m/money_market.md) funds seeking a short-term [investment vehicle](../i/investment_vehicle.md).

### Credit Enhancement

The addition of [credit](../c/credit.md) enhancements like letters of [credit](../c/credit.md), guarantees, or [insurance](../i/insurance.md) makes ABCP a relatively secure investment.

## Future Trends and Developments

The ABCP [market](../m/market.md) continues to evolve with ongoing regulatory changes and technological advancements. [Blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology, for instance, is poised to provide greater [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) in the issuance and trading of ABCP.

### Impact of Blockchain

[Blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology could streamline the ABCP [market](../m/market.md) by enabling real-time tracking of transactions and enhancing the [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and [security](../s/security.md) of [asset](../a/asset.md)-backed securities.

### Sustainable Investment

Thereâ€™s also a growing [interest](../i/interest.md) in incorporating ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) criteria into ABCP, aligning investment products with sustainable and [ethical standards](../e/ethical_standards_in_trading.md).

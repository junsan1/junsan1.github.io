# Automatic Bill Payment

Automatic bill [payment](../p/payment.md) is a method of financial [transaction](../t/transaction.md) that allows individuals and businesses to pay bills electronically from their [bank](../b/bank.md) accounts or other financial services without manually performing the [transaction](../t/transaction.md). This functionality is commonly used to manage recurring payments, such as [utility](../u/utility.md) bills, mortgages, subscriptions, and [loan](../l/loan.md) repayments.

## Concept and Basics

Automatic bill [payment](../p/payment.md) is designed to streamline the [payment](../p/payment.md) process by ensuring that [obligations](../o/obligation.md) are met promptly and efficiently. Here’s a breakdown of the essential components:

### How It Works

1. **Authorization**: The [customer](../c/customer.md) provides authorization for the automatic [payment](../p/payment.md). This can be done via a written agreement, electronically, or through a physical form provided by the service provider.
2. **Schedule**: Payments are scheduled for specific dates, which can be on a monthly, quarterly, or annual [basis](../b/basis.md), depending on the agreement.
3. **[Bank](../b/bank.md) Details**: The [customer](../c/customer.md) provides their [bank](../b/bank.md) account or [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) details from which the payments [will](../w/will.md) be deducted.
4. **[Execution](../e/execution.md)**: On the specified date, the [bank](../b/bank.md) or financial service provider automatically transfers the specified amount to the biller’s account.
5. **Confirmation**: Both the payer and the [payee](../p/payee.md) receive a confirmation of the [transaction](../t/transaction.md), often via email or SMS.

### Types of Automatic Bill Payments

1. **Direct [Debit](../d/debit.md)**: Payments are withdrawn directly from the [customer](../c/customer.md)'s [bank](../b/bank.md) account. This is the most common form of automatic bill [payment](../p/payment.md).
2. **[Credit Card](../c/credit_card.md) Payments**: Payments are charged to the [customer](../c/customer.md)'s [credit card](../c/credit_card.md).
3. **Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT)**: Payments are transferred from one [bank](../b/bank.md) account to another through electronic means.
4. **Mobile Payments**: Leveraging mobile applications and services to facilitate automatic bill payments.

# Adjusting Journal Entry

An adjusting [journal](../j/journal.md) entry is a type of [accounting](../a/accounting.md) entry made to correct or update the balances of accounts at the end of an [accounting](../a/accounting.md) period. These adjustments are necessary to align the [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) with the accrual [basis](../b/basis.md) of [accounting](../a/accounting.md), ensuring that revenues and expenses are recorded in the period in which they are actually incurred, not necessarily when cash is received or paid. By doing so, businesses can provide a more accurate and complete picture of their financial standing.

## Types of Adjusting Journal Entries

1. **Accrued Revenues:** These are revenues that have been earned but not yet recorded in the accounts. For example, a company provides services to a client in December but does not bill the client until January. An adjusting entry is needed to record the [revenue](../r/revenue.md) in December.

2. **Accrued Expenses:** These are expenses that have been incurred but not yet recorded. For example, a company receives a bill for utilities used in December but does not pay it until January. An adjusting entry is necessary to record the [expense](../e/expense.md) in December.

3. **Deferred Revenues:** These are revenues that have been received but not yet earned. For example, a company receives [advance payment](../a/advance_payment.md) from a [customer](../c/customer.md) in December for services to be provided in the next year. An adjusting entry is required to defer the [revenue](../r/revenue.md) to the period when the service is actually provided.

4. **Deferred Expenses:** These are expenses that have been paid but not yet incurred. For example, a company pays for a one-year [insurance](../i/insurance.md) policy in advance. An adjusting entry is needed to allocate the [expense](../e/expense.md) over the periods to which it applies.

5. **[Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md):** This is the allocation of the cost of a [fixed asset](../f/fixed_asset.md) over its [useful life](../u/useful_life.md). An adjusting entry for [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) is made to recognize the [expense](../e/expense.md) in the period in which the [asset](../a/asset.md) is used.

## Importance of Adjusting Journal Entries

Adjusting [journal](../j/journal.md) entries are vital for several reasons:

- **Accurate Financial Reporting:** They ensure that the [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) present a true and fair view of the company's [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) and position.
- **Compliance with [Accounting](../a/accounting.md) Standards:** Adjusting entries are essential for compliance with Generally Accepted [Accounting Principles](../a/accounting_principles.md) (GAAP) or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
- **Tax Reporting:** Accurate adjusting entries ensure that revenues and expenses are reported in the correct periods, which is crucial for tax calculations and compliance.

## Steps to Make Adjusting Journal Entries

1. **Identify Transactions:** Determine which transactions require adjustments.
2. **Calculate Amounts:** Calculate the amounts to be adjusted.
3. **Prepare Entries:** Prepare the adjusting [journal](../j/journal.md) entries to record the adjustments.
4. **Post Entries:** Post the entries to the appropriate accounts in the [general ledger](../g/general_ledger.md).
5. **Review:** Review the entries to ensure accuracy and completeness.

## Examples of Adjusting Journal Entries

### Example 1: Accrued Revenue

A company provided $5,000 worth of services on December 31 but did not bill the [customer](../c/customer.md) until January 5. The adjusting entry on December 31 would be:

```
Accounts [Receivable](../r/receivable.md)     $5,000
   Service [Revenue](../r/revenue.md)          $5,000
```

### Example 2: Accrued Expense

A company incurred $1,200 in [utility](../u/utility.md) expenses in December but received the bill in January. The adjusting entry on December 31 would be:

```
Utilities [Expense](../e/expense.md)       $1,200
   Accounts Payable         $1,200
```

### Example 3: Deferred Revenue

A company received a $3,000 [advance payment](../a/advance_payment.md) on December 15 for services to be provided in January. The adjusting entry on December 31 would be:

```
Service [Revenue](../r/revenue.md)         $3,000
   [Deferred Revenue](../d/deferred_revenue.md)         $3,000
```

### Example 4: Deferred Expense

A company paid $24,000 on December 1 for a one-year [insurance](../i/insurance.md) policy. The adjusting entry on December 31 would be:

```
Prepaid [Insurance](../i/insurance.md)$24,000/12       $2,000
   [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) [Expense](../e/expense.md)      $2,000
```

### Example 5: Depreciation

A company has a piece of equipment that costs $60,000 with a [useful life](../u/useful_life.md) of 10 years. The annual [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) [expense](../e/expense.md) is $6,000. The adjusting entry on December 31 would be:

```
[Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) [Expense](../e/expense.md)    $6,000
   [Accumulated Depreciation](../a/accumulated_depreciation.md)  $6,000
```

## Common Challenges

- **Complexity:** Determining the correct amount and timing of adjustments can be complex, particularly for large organizations with numerous transactions.
- **[Judgment](../j/judgment.md):** Some adjustments require significant [judgment](../j/judgment.md), such as estimating [useful life](../u/useful_life.md) for [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) or determining the amount of accrued expenses.
- **Timing:** Adjustments must be made in a timely manner to ensure that [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) are accurate and complete.

## Tools and Technology

Many [accounting](../a/accounting.md) software packages, such as QuickBooks, Xero, and FreshBooks, provide features to automate the process of making adjusting [journal](../j/journal.md) entries.

By making these adjustments, businesses can comply with [accounting](../a/accounting.md) standards, provide accurate information to stakeholders, and make informed financial decisions.

# American Depositary Share (ADS)

An American Depositary Share (ADS) is a U.S. dollar-denominated [equity](../e/equity.md) share of a foreign-based company available for purchase on an American stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md). Each ADS represents one or more [shares](../s/shares.md) of a foreign stock or a fraction of a share. The terms "American Depositary [Shares](../s/shares.md)" and "American Depositary [Receipts](../r/receipt.md)" (ADR) are often used interchangeably. 

ADSs are a way for American investors to invest in non-U.S. companies without dealing with foreign stock exchanges or currencies. They are particularly common for firms from countries where [capital](../c/capital.md) controls or other restrictions make it difficult for foreign investors to purchase [shares](../s/shares.md) directly.

## History of ADS

The concept of American Depositary [Shares](../s/shares.md) was introduced in the 1920s as a mechanism to facilitate the trading of foreign [stocks](../s/stock.md) on U.S. exchanges. JPMorgan Chase & Co. is credited with creating the first ADR, which was for the British retailer Selfridges in 1927. Since then, the popularity of ADSs has increased significantly, especially as [globalization](../g/globalization.md) has connected the world's [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

## How ADS Works

When a foreign company wants to list its [shares](../s/shares.md) on a United States [exchange](../e/exchange.md), it typically partners with a U.S. [bank](../b/bank.md) to [issue](../i/issue.md) ADSs. The process begins in the foreign company’s [home](../h/home.md) country, where the company deposits its [shares](../s/shares.md) with a local [custodian](../c/custodian.md) [bank](../b/bank.md) associated with a U.S. [bank](../b/bank.md). The U.S. [bank](../b/bank.md) then issues the ADSs, which represent the [shares](../s/shares.md) held by the [custodian](../c/custodian.md) [bank](../b/bank.md).

Each ADS can represent one share, [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [shares](../s/shares.md), or fractions of a share of the foreign company’s stock. This allows the ADS to be priced at a level that is attractive to U.S. investors.

## Types of ADS Programs

There are three main types of ADS programs:

1. **Sponsored ADRs**: These are created when a foreign company selects a U.S. [bank](../b/bank.md) to serve as the ADR depositary. The foreign company provides [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) and other information necessary to comply with U.S. regulations. Sponsored ADRs can be further categorized into three levels based on their complexity and regulatory requirements:
   - **Level I**: These are the simplest form, traded over-the-counter (OTC). They require minimal reporting to the SEC.
   - **Level II**: These ADRs are [listed](../l/listed.md) on U.S. stock exchanges (e.g., NYSE or [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md)) and require more stringent reporting to the SEC, including compliance with U.S. GAAP or IFRS.
   - **Level III**: These involve the same level of SEC reporting as Level II but also include a [capital](../c/capital.md)-raising [transaction](../t/transaction.md) in the U.S. public markets.

2. **Unsponsored ADRs**: These ADRs are created without the involvement of the foreign company. Instead, a U.S. [broker](../b/broker.md) or investment [bank](../b/bank.md) creates them based on existing [shares](../s/shares.md) trading in the foreign [market](../m/market.md). Unsponsored ADRs do not require the foreign company to provide financial information or comply with U.S. regulations.

3. **Global Depositary [Receipts](../r/receipt.md) (GDRs)**: These are similar to ADRs but are traded in [multiple](../m/multiple.md) international markets, including non-U.S. exchanges. They are often used for [capital](../c/capital.md) raising outside the [issuer](../i/issuer.md)'s [home](../h/home.md) country, covering both Europe and the U.S. markets.

## Advantages of ADS

ADSs [offer](../o/offer.md) several advantages to both investors and foreign companies:

### For Investors:
1. **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: ADSs provide U.S. investors with an opportunity to diversify their portfolios internationally without dealing with foreign brokers or [currency](../c/currency.md) conversions.
2. **Simplicity**: [Investing](../i/investing.md) in ADSs is as straightforward as [investing](../i/investing.md) in U.S. [stocks](../s/stock.md). They are traded on U.S. exchanges, and transactions are settled in U.S. dollars.
3. **Accessibility**: ADSs are available through conventional brokerage accounts, and investors can [leverage](../l/leverage.md) standard tools and platforms used for U.S. equities.
4. **[Transparency](../t/transparency.md)**: ADSs of foreign companies [listed](../l/listed.md) on major U.S. exchanges are subject to the same financial [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) requirements as U.S. companies, providing investors with access to detailed information.
5. **Dividends**: Any dividends paid on the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [shares](../s/shares.md) are converted into U.S. dollars and distributed to ADS holders.

### For Foreign Companies:
1. **Access to [Capital](../c/capital.md)**: By listing ADSs in the U.S., foreign companies can tap into the largest [capital](../c/capital.md) [market](../m/market.md) in the world, potentially increasing their funding opportunities.
2. **Increased [Visibility](../v/visibility.md)**: A U.S. listing can enhance a foreign company's [visibility](../v/visibility.md) and reputation among global investors.
3. **Broader [Investor](../i/investor.md) Base**: Foreign companies can diversify their [investor](../i/investor.md) base beyond their [home](../h/home.md) country, attracting U.S. institutional and retail investors.
4. **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)**: ADSs [offer](../o/offer.md) foreign companies a way to increase the [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) of their [shares](../s/shares.md), making them more attractive to investors.

## Risks of ADS

Despite their advantages, [investing](../i/investing.md) in ADSs carries certain risks:

### For Investors:
1. **[Currency](../c/currency.md) [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: While transactions are in U.S. dollars, the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [shares](../s/shares.md) are priced in the foreign country’s [currency](../c/currency.md). [Exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) fluctuations can affect the [value](../v/value.md) of the ADS.
2. **[Political Risk](../p/political_risk.md)**: Investments in foreign companies are subject to the political environment of the [issuer](../i/issuer.md)’s country, including changes in laws, regulations, or government stability.
3. **Economic [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: The [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md) in the foreign company’s [home](../h/home.md) country can impact its performance and, consequently, the [value](../v/value.md) of the ADS.
4. **[Liquidity Risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md)**: Some ADSs may have lower trading volumes compared to U.S. [stocks](../s/stock.md), potentially leading to larger [bid](../b/bid.md)-ask [spreads](../s/spreads.md) and difficulty in buying or selling [shares](../s/shares.md) quickly.
5. **Regulatory and Compliance [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: Foreign companies may be subject to different [accounting](../a/accounting.md) standards and regulatory environments, posing challenges in accurately assessing [financial health](../f/financial_health.md).

### For Foreign Companies:
1. **Regulatory Compliance**: Foreign companies must adhere to SEC regulations and may need to provide more extensive disclosures, which can be time-consuming and costly.
2. **Costs**: Listing ADSs involves fees related to issuance, regulatory compliance, and ongoing reporting requirements.
3. **[Market](../m/market.md) Scrutiny**: A U.S. listing subjects foreign companies to greater scrutiny from investors and analysts, potentially impacting stock prices based on [earnings](../e/earnings.md) reports and news.

## Regulatory Environment

ADSs are subject to regulations in both the [issuer](../i/issuer.md)'s [home](../h/home.md) country and the United States. The primary U.S. regulatory body overseeing ADSs is the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC). Key regulatory requirements include:

1. **Registration**: Foreign companies must file a registration statement with the SEC, typically using Form F-6, to describe the terms of the ADR program.
2. **Reporting**: Foreign companies with Level II and III ADR programs must file annual reports (Form 20-F or Form 40-F) and timely updates (Form 6-K) with the SEC, providing [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) and other disclosures.
3. **Sarbanes-Oxley Act Compliance**: Foreign companies [listed](../l/listed.md) on U.S. exchanges must comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which mandates internal control assessments, management certifications, and auditor independence rules.

## Conclusion

American Depositary [Shares](../s/shares.md) serve as a crucial bridge between international companies and U.S. investors, enabling cross-border investments and global [market](../m/market.md) integration. They provide a convenient and reliable method for U.S. investors to [gain](../g/gain.md) exposure to foreign equities while [offering](../o/offering.md) foreign companies access to the vast [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and [capital](../c/capital.md) of the U.S. [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

# Aroon Oscillator

The Aroon [Oscillator](../o/oscillator.md) is a popular technical [indicator](../i/indicator.md) used in stock trading and financial [market](../m/market.md) analysis. Developed by Tushar Chande in 1995, the Aroon [Oscillator](../o/oscillator.md) is designed to measure the strength and direction of a [trend](../t/trend.md). The term "Aroon" is derived from the Sanskrit word for "Dawn," symbolizing the beginning of a new [trend](../t/trend.md) or the end of an existing one. The Aroon [Oscillator](../o/oscillator.md) combines two separate indicators—Aroon Up and Aroon Down—to give traders a comprehensive view of the [market](../m/market.md)’s [momentum](../m/momentum.md).

## The Components of the Aroon Oscillator

The Aroon [Oscillator](../o/oscillator.md) itself is derived from two Aroon indicators:

1. **Aroon Up**: This [indicator](../i/indicator.md) measures the number of periods since the highest high within a given timeframe.
2. **Aroon Down**: This [indicator](../i/indicator.md) measures the number of periods since the lowest low within a given timeframe.

Both indicators oscillate between 0 and 100. The Aroon [Oscillator](../o/oscillator.md) is calculated by subtracting the Aroon Down [value](../v/value.md) from the Aroon Up [value](../v/value.md):

\[ \text{Aroon [Oscillator](../o/oscillator.md)} = \text{Aroon Up} - \text{Aroon Down} \]

The resulting [value](../v/value.md) of the Aroon [Oscillator](../o/oscillator.md) also oscillates between -100 and 100, providing a metric to gauge the strength and direction of a [trend](../t/trend.md).

## Calculation

To understand how the Aroon [Oscillator](../o/oscillator.md) works, it's vital to break down the calculations that underpin it:

### Aroon Up and Aroon Down

- **Aroon Up Calculation**:
  \[ \text{Aroon Up} = \left( \frac{n - \text{periods since highest high}}{n} \right) \times 100 \]
  where \( n \) is the number of periods.

- **Aroon Down Calculation**:
  \[ \text{Aroon Down} = \left( \frac{n - \text{periods since lowest low}}{n} \right) \times 100 \]

### Aroon Oscillator Calculation

Once the Aroon Up and Aroon Down values are established, they are combined into the Aroon [Oscillator](../o/oscillator.md):

\[ \text{Aroon [Oscillator](../o/oscillator.md)} = \text{Aroon Up} - \text{Aroon Down} \]

For example, if the Aroon Up [value](../v/value.md) is 70 and the Aroon Down [value](../v/value.md) is 30, the Aroon [Oscillator](../o/oscillator.md) [will](../w/will.md) be:

\[ \text{Aroon [Oscillator](../o/oscillator.md)} = 70 - 30 = 40 \]

## Interpretation of the Aroon Oscillator

The Aroon [Oscillator](../o/oscillator.md) helps traders to determine the strength of a [trend](../t/trend.md) and its likely continuation or [reversal](../r/reversal.md):

- **Values above 50**: This suggests a strong [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md).
- **Values below -50**: This points to a strong [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md).
- **Values between -50 and 50**: These indicate a weaker or ambiguously directed [trend](../t/trend.md).

### Key Signals

1. **Crossing Above Zero**:
   - When the Aroon [Oscillator](../o/oscillator.md) crosses above zero from below, it indicates that the [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md) is strengthening.
2. **Crossing Below Zero**:
   - Conversely, when it crosses below zero from above, it suggests that the [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md) is gaining strength.

### Bullish Signals

- **Consistently High Aroon Up**: When the Aroon Up remains consistently high (typically above 70) while the Aroon Down is low (below 30), it indicates a strong bullish [trend](../t/trend.md).
- **Increasing Aroon [Oscillator](../o/oscillator.md)**: When the Aroon [Oscillator](../o/oscillator.md) is rising, especially above zero, it reinforces a bullish [trend](../t/trend.md).

### Bearish Signals

- **Consistently High Aroon Down**: When the Aroon Down remains consistently high while the Aroon Up is low, it signals a bearish [market](../m/market.md).
- **Decreasing Aroon [Oscillator](../o/oscillator.md)**: A falling Aroon [Oscillator](../o/oscillator.md), particularly when it dips below zero, supports a bearish outlook.

## Practical Applications

### Trend Identification

Traders use the Aroon [Oscillator](../o/oscillator.md) to identify the commencement and termination of trends. For instance, a rise above zero can highlight the beginning of an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md), while a fall below zero can signal the start of a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md).

### Volume Confirmation

Combining the Aroon [Oscillator](../o/oscillator.md) with [volume](../v/volume.md) data can strengthen its signals. For example, a bullish Aroon [Oscillator](../o/oscillator.md) signal accompanied by increasing [volume](../v/volume.md) can reinforce the [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md)'s strength.

### Trading Strategies

#### Basic Strategy

- **Buy Signal**: When the Aroon [Oscillator](../o/oscillator.md) crosses above zero.
- **Sell Signal**: When the Aroon [Oscillator](../o/oscillator.md) crosses below zero.

#### Divergence Strategy

- **[Bullish Divergence](../b/bullish_divergence.md)**: Occurs when the price makes a new low, but the Aroon [Oscillator](../o/oscillator.md) does not, suggesting a possible bullish [reversal](../r/reversal.md).
- **[Bearish Divergence](../b/bearish_divergence.md)**: Happens when the price makes a new high, but the Aroon [Oscillator](../o/oscillator.md) does not, indicating a potential bearish [reversal](../r/reversal.md).

### Example Analysis

Consider a stock where:

- The Aroon Up is at 80, indicating the highest high was relatively recent.
- The Aroon Down is at 20, suggesting the lowest low is not recent.

This results in an Aroon [Oscillator](../o/oscillator.md) [value](../v/value.md) of 60, which signals a strong [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md). Conversely, if the Aroon Up were 20 and the Aroon Down were 70, the Aroon [Oscillator](../o/oscillator.md) would be -50, flagging a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md).

## Limitations

While powerful, the Aroon [Oscillator](../o/oscillator.md) is not without its limitations:

1. **[Lagging Indicator](../l/lagging_indicator.md)**: As with many [trend](../t/trend.md)-following tools, the Aroon [Oscillator](../o/oscillator.md) can be a [lagging indicator](../l/lagging_indicator.md), often confirming trends that have already begun.
2. **Sideways Markets**: During horizontal or sideways markets, the Aroon [Oscillator](../o/oscillator.md) can give [false signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md), making it less effective.
3. **Divergences**: Misinterpreting divergences can lead to incorrect predictions; therefore, it is crucial to confirm signals with other [technical analysis tools](../t/technical_analysis_tools.md).

## Conclusion

The Aroon [Oscillator](../o/oscillator.md) is a versatile and influential tool in the arsenal of traders and analysts. It provides valuable insights into [trend](../t/trend.md) strength and direction by leveraging the symmetric properties of the Aroon Up and Aroon Down indicators. Correctly interpreted, it can significantly enhance the decision-making process, although it is often best used in combination with other indicators to mitigate its limitations and maximize its efficacy.

# Affordable Care Act

The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, is a comprehensive health care reform law enacted in March 2010. The law has three primary goals: 

1. **Make affordable [health insurance](../h/health_insurance.md) available to more people** by providing subsidies ([premium](../p/premium.md) tax credits) to individuals and families with incomes between 100% and 400% of the federal [poverty](../p/poverty.md) level (FPL).
2. **Expand the [Medicaid](../m/medicaid.md) program** to cover all adults with [income](../i/income.md) below 138% of the FPL. Not all states have expanded their [Medicaid](../m/medicaid.md) programs.
3. **Support innovative medical care delivery methods** designed to lower the costs of health care generally.

## Key Provisions of the Affordable Care Act

### Individual Mandate
The ACA initially required all Americans to have [health insurance](../h/health_insurance.md) or face a tax penalty. This mandate aimed to ensure that more people entered the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) [market](../m/market.md), balancing out the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) [risk](../r/risk.md) pool with both healthy and unhealthy individuals. However, the tax penalty for not having [insurance](../i/insurance.md) was effectively eliminated in 2019 by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

### Health Insurance Marketplaces
The ACA established [health insurance](../h/health_insurance.md) marketplaces (or exchanges) where individuals and small businesses can compare and purchase [insurance](../i/insurance.md) plans. These marketplaces are run by federal or state governments. They are crucial in providing access to standardized, regulated [health insurance](../h/health_insurance.md) plans and in facilitating [premium](../p/premium.md) subsidies.

### Medicaid Expansion
A significant [provision](../p/provision.md) of the ACA was the [expansion](../e/expansion.md) of [Medicaid](../m/medicaid.md), designed to cover more low-[income](../i/income.md) individuals and families. The [expansion](../e/expansion.md) made [Medicaid](../m/medicaid.md) available to all individuals with incomes up to 138% of the FPL. However, the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that states could opt-out of this [expansion](../e/expansion.md), leading to a patchwork of [Medicaid](../m/medicaid.md) availability across the country.

### Subsidies for Private Insurance
The ACA provides subsidies to help lower the costs of [health insurance](../h/health_insurance.md) for individuals and families within specific [income](../i/income.md) brackets. These subsidies come in two forms:
- **[Premium](../p/premium.md) Tax Credits**: These help lower the monthly [premium](../p/premium.md) costs.
- **Cost-Sharing Reductions**: These help reduce out-of-pocket costs such as deductibles and copayments for low-[income](../i/income.md) individuals.

### Employer Mandate
The ACA imposed a mandate on large employers (those with 50 or more full-time employees) to provide [health insurance](../h/health_insurance.md) to their employees or face penalties. This [provision](../p/provision.md) aims to ensure that more working Americans have access to employer-sponsored health coverage.

### Coverage for Preexisting Conditions
One of the hallmark features of the ACA is the prohibition against denying coverage or charging higher premiums due to preexisting conditions. This ensures that individuals with chronic illnesses or past health issues can obtain [insurance](../i/insurance.md) without facing prohibitive costs or outright denial.

### Essential Health Benefits
The ACA requires that all [health insurance](../h/health_insurance.md) plans offered in the individual and small group markets cover a set of essential health benefits, including but not limited to:
  - Ambulatory patient services
  - Emergency services
  - Hospitalization
  - Maternity and newborn care
  - Mental health and substance use disorder services
  - Prescription drugs
  - Rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices
  - Laboratory services
  - Preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management
  - Pediatric services, including oral and vision care

### Preventive Care
The ACA mandates that most [insurance](../i/insurance.md) plans provide preventive care services without charging a copayment, coinsurance, or deductible. This includes services like vaccinations, screenings, and preventive medications.

## Impact on the Health Care System

### Increased Insurance Coverage
Since its enactment, the ACA has significantly decreased the number of uninsured Americans. According to a report by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS), the uninsured rate among nonelderly Americans dropped from 16.3% in 2010 to 8.8% in 2019.

### Health Care Costs
The ACA includes several measures aimed at reducing health care costs. These include penalties to hospitals for high readmission rates, encouraging the formation of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs), and promoting [value](../v/value.md)-based purchasing programs.

### Quality of Care
The law promotes the use of electronic health records (EHRs) and other health IT to improve the quality of care and patient outcomes. Additionally, the ACA has initiatives to improve care coordination, patient safety, and the quality of care provided in hospitals and other settings.

## Legal Challenges and Reforms
The ACA has faced numerous legal challenges and attempts at repeal since its enactment. One of the most significant challenges occurred in 2012 when the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the ACA's individual mandate but allowed states to opt-out of [Medicaid](../m/medicaid.md) [expansion](../e/expansion.md).

Under the Trump administration, there were several efforts to repeal and replace the ACA, but none succeeded. Instead, the individual mandate penalty was reduced to $0 starting in 2019, effectively eliminating the enforcement of the mandate.

## Future Considerations
The ACA remains a crucial part of the American health care landscape. As health care costs continue to rise and disparities in access to health services persist, the ACA's provisions and ongoing reforms [will](../w/will.md) play a significant role in shaping the future of health care in the United States.

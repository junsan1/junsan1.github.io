# Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)

Adjusted [Gross Income](../g/gross_income.md) (AGI) is a critical concept in the realm of [taxation](../t/taxation.md) and [finance](../f/finance.md), particularly within the United States tax code. It serves as a foundation for determining [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md) and is a pivotal figure on individual tax returns. Understanding AGI helps taxpayers identify their [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md), eligibility for various deductions, credits, and other tax-related benefits. This detailed exposition [will](../w/will.md) delve into the components, calculation, and implications of AGI, covering various aspects that influence this fundamental figure.

### Definition and Importance of AGI

Adjusted [Gross Income](../g/gross_income.md) (AGI) is the total [gross income](../g/gross_income.md) of an individual or entity minus specific deductions, also known as adjustments. It reflects an individual's financial situation more accurately than [gross income](../g/gross_income.md) alone, as it accounts for allowable expenses related to [earnings](../e/earnings.md).

AGI is essential for several reasons:
- **[Taxable Income](../t/taxable_income.md) Calculation**: AGI is the starting point for determining [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md). From AGI, additional deductions and exemptions can be applied to arrive at the final [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md).
- **Tax Bracket Determination**: It helps in placing taxpayers within appropriate [tax brackets](../t/tax_brackets.md), which dictate the percentage of [income](../i/income.md) paid in [taxes](../t/taxes.md).
- **Eligibility for Tax Credits and Deductions**: Many tax credits and deductions have [income](../i/income.md) limits based on AGI. For instance, deductions for medical expenses, student [loan](../l/loan.md) [interest](../i/interest.md), and educational credits are often tied to AGI.
- **Impact on Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)**: AGI is used in the computation for the AMT, a parallel tax system designed to ensure higher-[income](../i/income.md) individuals pay a fair share of [taxes](../t/taxes.md).

### Components of AGI

#### Gross Income
[Gross income](../g/gross_income.md) includes all [income](../i/income.md) received in the form of [money](../m/money.md), goods, property, and services not exempt from tax. Types of [gross income](../g/gross_income.md) include:
- **Wages and Salaries**: Compensation from employment, including bonuses and commissions.
- **[Business](../b/business.md) [Income](../i/income.md)**: Profits from [self-employment](../s/self-employment.md), partnerships, and S corporations.
- **Dividends and [Interest](../i/interest.md)**: [Earnings](../e/earnings.md) from investments and savings.
- **[Capital](../c/capital.md) Gains**: Profits from the [sale](../s/sale.md) of investments or property.
- **Rental [Income](../i/income.md)**: [Income](../i/income.md) from leasing property.
- **Alimony Received**: Payments received from a former spouse as part of a divorce settlement (for divorces finalized before 2019).
- **Pension and Annuities**: Distributions from retirement accounts.
- **[Unemployment Compensation](../u/unemployment_compensation.md)**: Benefits received due to job loss.
- **[Social Security](../s/social_security.md) Benefits**: Depending on [income](../i/income.md) levels, up to 85% of [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) benefits may be taxable.

#### Adjustments to Income
Adjustments to [income](../i/income.md), also known as "above-the-line" deductions, are specific expenses that the IRS allows taxpayers to subtract from [gross income](../g/gross_income.md) to arrive at AGI. They include:
- **Educator Expenses**: Certain expenses incurred by teachers for classroom supplies.
- **Health [Savings Account](../s/savings_account.md) (HSA) Contributions**: Contributions to an HSA, which offers tax advantages for medical expenses.
- **Moving Expenses**: For qualified Armed Forces members moving due to a military [order](../o/order.md).
- **[Self-Employment](../s/self-employment.md) [Taxes](../t/taxes.md)**: [Deduction](../d/deduction.md) of half of the [self-employment](../s/self-employment.md) tax.
- **Self-Employed [Health Insurance](../h/health_insurance.md)**: Premiums paid for [health insurance](../h/health_insurance.md) by self-employed individuals.
- **Self-Employed SEP, SIMPLE, and Qualified Plans**: Contributions to retirement plans by self-employed taxpayers.
- **Penalty on Early [Withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) of Savings**: Penalties paid for premature [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) from savings.
- **Alimony Paid**: Payments made to a former spouse under a divorce agreement finalized before 2019.
- **IRA Contributions**: Certain contributions to traditional Individual Retirement Accounts.
- **Student [Loan](../l/loan.md) [Interest](../i/interest.md)**: [Interest](../i/interest.md) paid on qualified student loans.
- **Tuition and Fees**: For higher education expenses (subject to [income](../i/income.md) limits and other conditions).

### Calculating AGI

The process of calculating AGI involves several steps:
1. **Total the [Gross Income](../g/gross_income.md)**: Add all sources of [income](../i/income.md) to determine [gross income](../g/gross_income.md).
2. **Subtract Adjustments**: Deduct all applicable above-the-line adjustments from the [gross income](../g/gross_income.md).
3. **Determine AGI**: The result after subtracting adjustments from [gross income](../g/gross_income.md) is the AGI.

The IRS provides tools and publications, such as the [IRS Form 1040](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1040), to assist in the accurate calculation of AGI.

### Implications of AGI

AGI affects numerous aspects of an individual's tax situation:
- **[Deduction](../d/deduction.md) Limitations**: Many deductions are limited to a percentage of the AGI. For example, medical expenses are deductible only to the extent that they exceed 7.5% (as of 2023) of AGI.
- **Phase-Out of Tax Benefits**: Many tax benefits phase out after reaching certain AGI thresholds. For instance, the [Child Tax Credit](../c/child_tax_credit.md) and [Lifetime Learning Credit](../l/lifetime_learning_credit.md) gradually reduce and eventually phase out at higher AGI levels.
- **Healthcare Subsidies**: Under the [Affordable Care Act](../a/affordable_care_act.md), eligibility for [premium](../p/premium.md) subsidies for [health insurance](../h/health_insurance.md) purchased through the marketplace is based on AGI.
- **Retirement Contributions**: AGI impacts eligibility to contribute to Roth IRAs and the deductibility of [traditional IRA](../t/traditional_ira.md) contributions.
- **[Income](../i/income.md)-Driven [Repayment](../r/repayment.md) Plans**: For federal student loans, AGI is used to determine [payment](../p/payment.md) amounts under [income](../i/income.md)-driven [repayment](../r/repayment.md) plans.

### Planning Strategies Involving AGI

Effective [tax planning](../t/tax_planning.md) involves strategies to manage AGI, optimizing [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md) and eligibility for tax benefits. Common strategies include:
- **Defer [Income](../i/income.md)**: Postpone receiving [income](../i/income.md) to the next tax year to reduce current year's AGI.
- **Increase Retirement Contributions**: Maximize contributions to retirement accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs, which reduce AGI.
- **Utilize Health Savings Accounts (HSAs)**: Contribute the maximum allowed to an HSA to lower AGI while saving for medical expenses.
- **Harvest [Capital](../c/capital.md) Losses**: Sell investments at a loss to [offset](../o/offset.md) [capital](../c/capital.md) gains and reduce overall AGI.
- **Consider [Filing Status](../f/filing_status.md)**: Married couples may benefit from evaluating whether to file jointly or separately to optimize AGI and related tax benefits.

### Differences Between AGI and Other Income Metrics

1. **[Gross Income](../g/gross_income.md)**: Total [income](../i/income.md) received before any deductions.
2. **Modified Adjusted [Gross Income](../g/gross_income.md) (MAGI)**: AGI with some adjustments added back in, used to determine eligibility for certain tax benefits and credits.
3. **[Taxable Income](../t/taxable_income.md)**: AGI minus standard or itemized deductions and personal exemptions, the portion of [income](../i/income.md) that is actually subject to tax.

### AGI and State Taxes

While federal tax returns use AGI, state tax returns may also rely on this figure. However, states often have their own adjustments and modifications that can impact the state [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md) differently.

### Conclusion

Adjusted [Gross Income](../g/gross_income.md) (AGI) is a cornerstone of individual tax filings, influencing not only the amount of [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md) but also eligibility for numerous tax credits and deductions. Understanding and managing AGI through strategic planning can lead to significant tax savings and optimize financial outcomes. Competent handling of AGI requires awareness of its components, impacts, and effective strategies to minimize [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md). Taxpayers are encouraged to use resources such as IRS publications and seek professional advice to navigate AGI calculations and implications effectively.

# Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO)

Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) is a [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) measure primarily used in the evaluation of [Real Estate](../r/real_estate.md) Investment Trusts (REITs). This metric is crucial for investors as it provides a clearer picture of a REIT's cash available for [distribution](../d/distribution.md) compared to its standard Funds From Operations (FFO). AFFO adjusts the traditional FFO metric by [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for the [capital](../c/capital.md) expenditures, maintenance costs, and other operational adjustments which FFO initially ignores. It offers a more precise assessment of a REIT’s [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and distributable [income](../i/income.md).

## Importance and Usage of AFFO

AFFO is particularly significant in the context of REITs for several reasons:

1. **Better Measure of [Dividend](../d/dividend.md) Sustainability**: Since REITs are required to distribute a significant percentage of their [income](../i/income.md) as dividends, AFFO helps in gauging the sustainability of these [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payments. Unlike FFO, AFFO accounts for expenditures necessary to maintain the properties, which provides a more realistic view of cash available for [distribution](../d/distribution.md).

2. **Enhanced Comparability**: AFFO helps investors in comparing different REITs more effectively. As it factors in recurring [capital](../c/capital.md) expenditures and operational adjustments, it presents a standardized financial metric.

3. **Investment Decision Making**: For potential investors, understanding a REIT’s AFFO is critical in making informed decisions regarding the purchase or [sale](../s/sale.md) of REIT [shares](../s/shares.md). AFFO can illustrate whether a REIT is generating sufficient cash flows to cover operating expenses and [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payments.

## Calculating AFFO

The calculation of AFFO typically involves adjusting the Funds From Operations (FFO) figure with various factors. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Start with FFO**: Funds From Operations is calculated by adding [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) and amortization to net [income](../i/income.md) and subtracting any gains on sales of properties.

    ```
    FFO = Net [Income](../i/income.md) + [Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) & Amortization - Gains on [Sale](../s/sale.md) of Properties
    ```

2. **Subtract Recurring [Capital](../c/capital.md) Expenditures**: This includes costs related to maintaining and improving properties.

3. **Subtract Straight-Lining of Rents**: Any adjustment made to account for leases that have rent payments that aren’t consistent month to month or year to year.

4. **Add/Subtract Non-Cash Items**: This includes non-cash [income](../i/income.md) or expenses that aren’t representative of the REIT’s core operations.

    ```
    AFFO = FFO - Recurring [Capital](../c/capital.md) Expenditures - Straight-Lining of Rents + Non-Cash Items
    ```

## Example Calculation

Let’s consider a hypothetical REIT to illustrate the AFFO calculation process:

- Net [Income](../i/income.md): $50 million
- [Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) & Amortization: $30 million
- Gains on [Sale](../s/sale.md) of Properties: $5 million
- Recurring [Capital](../c/capital.md) Expenditures: $10 million
- Straight-Lining of Rents Adjustment: $3 million
- Non-Cash Items: $2 million

### 1. Calculate FFO

```
FFO = Net [Income](../i/income.md) + [Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) & Amortization - Gains on [Sale](../s/sale.md) of Properties
FFO = $50 million + $30 million - $5 million = $75 million
```

### 2. Adjust to Calculate AFFO

```
AFFO = FFO - Recurring [Capital](../c/capital.md) Expenditures - Straight-Lining of Rents + Non-Cash Items
AFFO = $75 million - $10 million - $3 million + $2 million = $64 million
```

In this example, the REIT has an AFFO of $64 million, which represents the cash available for [distribution](../d/distribution.md) after all necessary adjustments.

## Comparison to Other Metrics

### FFO vs. AFFO

- **Funds From Operations (FFO)**: This metric, as defined by the National Association of [Real Estate](../r/real_estate.md) Investment Trusts (NAREIT), adjusts net [income](../i/income.md) for gains or losses on sales of properties and adds back [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) and amortization. FFO is a useful measure of operating performance but does not account for necessary [capital](../c/capital.md) expenditures.
  
- **Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO)**: Takes FFO a step further by incorporating recurring [capital](../c/capital.md) expenditures, straight-lining of rents, and non-cash items. AFFO is considered a more accurate measure of a REIT’s ability to generate cash for [distribution](../d/distribution.md).

### Net Operating Income (NOI) vs. AFFO

- **Net [Operating Income](../o/operating_income.md) (NOI)**: This metric focuses on the [income](../i/income.md) generated from property operations, excluding [financing](../f/financing.md) costs and [taxes](../t/taxes.md). It’s useful for understanding the profitability of a property but does not account for broader financial considerations like [capital expenditure](../c/capital_expenditure.md).

- **AFFO**: Provides a comprehensive view by considering both operational performance and financial adjustments, thus [offering](../o/offering.md) a fuller picture of the REIT’s distributable cash.

## Importance of AFFO in Valuation

Investors use AFFO in several [valuation](../v/valuation.md) methods:

### Dividend Discount Model (DDM)

This model values a REIT based on the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of its expected future dividends. Since AFFO represents cash available for [distribution](../d/distribution.md), it provides a reliable [basis](../b/basis.md) for projecting future dividends.

### Price to AFFO Ratio

Similar to the Price to [Earnings](../e/earnings.md) (P/E) ratio, the Price to AFFO ratio helps investors determine if a REIT is [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md) or [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) in the [market](../m/market.md). A lower ratio suggests that the REIT is [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) relative to its peers.

## Practical Considerations

### Adjustments to AFFO

The adjustments made to FFO to calculate AFFO can vary between REITs due to differences in [accounting](../a/accounting.md) practices and operational structures. Common adjustments include:

- **[Capital](../c/capital.md) Improvements**: Enhancements made to extend the life of a property.
- **Leasing Costs**: Expenses related to securing new leases or renewing existing leases.
- **Non-Recurring Expenses**: One-time costs that are not expected to recur in the future.

### Transparency and Disclosure

It’s important for REITs to maintain [transparency](../t/transparency.md) in their AFFO calculations to ensure [investor](../i/investor.md) confidence. Detailed disclosures regarding the adjustments made to FFO are crucial for investors to make informed decisions.

## Industry Examples

Several prominent REITs utilize AFFO as a key performance [indicator](../i/indicator.md):

- **Realty [Income](../i/income.md) [Corporation](../c/corporation.md)**: Known for its monthly [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payments, Realty [Income](../i/income.md) [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) emphasizes AFFO as a core metric in its financial reporting ([Realty Income Corporation](https://www.realtyincome.com)).
- **Simon Property Group**: This REIT, specializing in shopping malls and retail properties, provides detailed AFFO calculations in its annual reports ([Simon Property Group](https://www.simon.com)).

## Conclusion

Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) is a critical metric in the [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) investment [trust](../t/trust.md) [industry](../i/industry.md), providing significant insights into a REIT’s [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and its ability to generate sustainable [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) for distributions. By adjusting the traditional FFO metric to account for necessary expenditures and operational adjustments, AFFO offers a more accurate representation of a REIT’s distributable [income](../i/income.md), aiding investors in making informed decisions. Understanding and carefully evaluating AFFO can lead to more effective investment strategies and enhanced [portfolio performance](../p/portfolio_performance.md) in the [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) sector.

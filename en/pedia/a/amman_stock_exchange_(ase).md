# Amman Stock Exchange (ASE)

The Amman Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (ASE) is the sole stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md) in Jordan. Established in 1999, the ASE plays a pivotal role in Jordan's [economy](../e/economy.md) as a platform for trading securities, thereby supporting economic investment and growth. The ASE operates under international standards with a transparent and secure [trading environment](../t/trading_environment.md), ensuring the integrity and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) in Jordan.

## History

The foundation of the ASE traces back to the early 1970s when the Amman Financial [Market](../m/market.md) (AFM) was created. By 1999, the AFM was restructured into the ASE to incorporate modern standards of financial trading and regulation. This transition was a significant step in streamlining Jordan's [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and aligning them with global practices, thereby attracting both local and international investors.

## Regulatory Framework

The ASE operates under a strict regulatory framework set by the Jordan Securities [Commission](../c/commission.md) (JSC). The JSC ensures that trading on the ASE is conducted in a fair, transparent, and orderly manner. It also oversees the licensing and regulation of [market](../m/market.md) participants, including brokerage firms, [listed](../l/listed.md) companies, and other financial institutions.

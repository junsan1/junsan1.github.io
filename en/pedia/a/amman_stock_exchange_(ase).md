# Amman Stock Exchange (ASE)

The Amman Stock Exchange (ASE) is the sole stock exchange in Jordan. Established in 1999, the ASE plays a pivotal role in Jordan's economy as a platform for trading securities, thereby supporting economic investment and growth. The ASE operates under international standards with a transparent and secure trading environment, ensuring the integrity and efficiency of financial markets in Jordan.

## History

The foundation of the ASE traces back to the early 1970s when the Amman Financial Market (AFM) was created. By 1999, the AFM was restructured into the ASE to incorporate modern standards of financial trading and regulation. This transition was a significant step in streamlining Jordan's financial markets and aligning them with global practices, thereby attracting both local and international investors.

## Regulatory Framework

The ASE operates under a strict regulatory framework set by the Jordan Securities Commission (JSC). The JSC ensures that trading on the ASE is conducted in a fair, transparent, and orderly manner. It also oversees the licensing and regulation of market participants, including brokerage firms, listed companies, and other financial institutions.

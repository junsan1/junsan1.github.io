# American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC)

The American Opportunity [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md) (AOTC) is a significant education-related [tax credit](../t/tax_credit.md) available to eligible students pursuing higher education in the United States. This [credit](../c/credit.md) is designed to help [offset](../o/offset.md) the costs associated with post-secondary education, making it a crucial financial aid tool for students and their families. The AOTC can be claimed for qualified education expenses paid for an eligible student for the first four years of higher education. Let's delve into the details of this [tax credit](../t/tax_credit.md), including eligibility criteria, how it works, what expenses qualify, and how to claim it.

## Eligibility Criteria

### Student Eligibility

1. **Enrollment Status**: To qualify for the AOTC, the student must be enrolled at least half-time in a program leading to a degree, certificate, or other recognized educational credential.
2. **Eligible Institutions**: The student must be enrolled in an eligible educational institution, which generally includes accredited post-secondary institutions such as colleges, universities, and vocational schools.
3. **Year of Study**: The [credit](../c/credit.md) is available only for the first four years of post-secondary education. Therefore, students beyond their fourth year do not qualify.
4. **No Felony Drug Conviction**: The student must not have been convicted of a felony drug offense during the tax year.

### Taxpayer and Dependent Criteria

1. **[Income](../i/income.md) Limits**: The [credit](../c/credit.md) is subject to [income](../i/income.md) limitations. For 2023, the full [credit](../c/credit.md) is available to taxpayers with a modified adjusted [gross income](../g/gross_income.md) (MAGI) of $80,000 or less ($160,000 or less for married couples filing jointly). The [credit](../c/credit.md) phases out for taxpayers with MAGIs between $80,000 and $90,000 ($160,000 and $180,000 for married couples filing jointly).
2. **[Filing Status](../f/filing_status.md)**: The [credit](../c/credit.md) can be claimed by taxpayers filing as single, [head of household](../h/head_of_household.md), qualifying widow(er), or [married filing jointly](../m/married_filing_jointly.md). It cannot be claimed by those using the [married filing separately](../m/married_filing_separately.md) status.
3. **[Taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) Identification**: Both the student and the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) claiming the [credit](../c/credit.md) must have valid [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) Numbers or Individual [Taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) Identification Numbers.

## How AOTC Works

1. **[Credit](../c/credit.md) Amount**: The AOTC provides a maximum annual [credit](../c/credit.md) of $2,500 per eligible student. This consists of 100% of the first $2,000 of qualified education expenses and 25% of the next $2,000.
2. **Partially Refundable**: Up to 40% of the AOTC (a maximum of $1,000) is refundable. This means that even if the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) owes no tax, they can still receive a refund of up to $1,000.
3. **Non-Refundable Portion**: The remaining 60% of the [credit](../c/credit.md) can reduce the amount of tax owed to zero but not below zero.

## Qualified Education Expenses

Qualified education expenses for the AOTC include:

1. **Tuition and Fees**: Amounts paid for tuition and fees required for enrollment or attendance at an eligible educational institution. This does not include amounts paid for courses involving sports, games, or hobbies unless they are part of the student's degree program.
2. **Course Materials**: Expenses for books, supplies, and equipment needed for a course of study, whether or not the materials are purchased from the educational institution.

### Exclusions

1. **Room and Board**: Costs of housing and meals are not considered qualified education expenses for the AOTC.
2. **Medical Expenses**: Health fees and [insurance](../i/insurance.md) costs are also excluded.

## How to Claim the AOTC

1. **Form 8863**: To claim the AOTC, taxpayers must complete Form 8863, Education Credits (American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning Credits), and attach it to their [tax return](../t/tax_return.md).
2. **[Form 1098](../f/form_1098.md)-T**: Eligible educational institutions provide [Form 1098](../f/form_1098.md)-T, Tuition Statement, to students. This form helps taxpayers determine the amount of qualified education expenses paid during the tax year.
3. **Record-Keeping**: Taxpayers should keep records of the expenses used to calculate the [credit](../c/credit.md), such as [receipts](../r/receipt.md), invoices, and the [Form 1098](../f/form_1098.md)-T, for at least four years in case of an audit.

## Comparison with Other Education Credits

Besides the AOTC, other education-related credits available to taxpayers include the [Lifetime Learning Credit](../l/lifetime_learning_credit.md) (LLC) and the Tuition and Fees [Deduction](../d/deduction.md). Here's a brief comparison:

1. **AOTC vs. LLC**:
   - **Eligibility Period**: The AOTC is available only for the first four years of post-secondary education, while the LLC is available for all years of post-secondary education and for courses to acquire or improve job skills.
   - **[Credit](../c/credit.md) Amount**: The AOTC offers a maximum [credit](../c/credit.md) of $2,500 per student, while the LLC offers up to $2,000 per [tax return](../t/tax_return.md).
   - **Refundability**: The AOTC is partly refundable; the LLC is non-refundable.
2. **AOTC vs. Tuition and Fees [Deduction](../d/deduction.md)**:
   - **Nature of Benefit**: The AOTC is a [credit](../c/credit.md), directly reducing the amount of tax owed, whereas the Tuition and Fees [Deduction](../d/deduction.md) is an adjustment to [income](../i/income.md), reducing [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md).
   - **[Income](../i/income.md) Limits**: The AOTC has higher [income](../i/income.md) phase-out limits compared to the Tuition and Fees [Deduction](../d/deduction.md).

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Full-Time Student

John is a full-time student in his sophomore year at a state university. During the tax year, he pays $4,000 in tuition and $600 for required textbooks. His parents, who file a [joint](../j/joint.md) [tax return](../t/tax_return.md) with a MAGI of $140,000, claim him as a dependent. They are eligible for the full AOTC.

### Calculation:
- Tuition and required textbooks: $4,000 (tuition) + $600 (books) = $4,600 (qualified expenses).
- AOTC: 100% of the first $2,000 = $2,000 + 25% of the next $2,000 = $500.
- Total AOTC: $2,500.

John's parents can claim a $2,500 [credit](../c/credit.md) on their [tax return](../t/tax_return.md).

### Example 2: Part-Time Student

Lisa is a part-time student in her second year at a community college. During the tax year, she pays $1,500 in tuition and $300 for required books. She files her own [tax return](../t/tax_return.md) with a MAGI of $30,000.

### Calculation:
- Tuition and required books: $1,500 (tuition) + $300 (books) = $1,800 (qualified expenses).
- AOTC: 100% of the first $1,800 = $1,800.
- Total AOTC: $1,800.

Lisa can claim a $1,800 [credit](../c/credit.md) on her [tax return](../t/tax_return.md), and up to 40% ($720) of it may be refundable if she owes no tax.

## Recent Changes and Updates

The AOTC is subject to legislative changes, so it's important for taxpayers to [check](../c/check.md) for any updates each tax year. Notably, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 retained the AOTC without significant changes, ensuring its continued availability for eligible students.

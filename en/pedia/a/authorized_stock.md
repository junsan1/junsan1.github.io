# Authorized Stock

Authorized stock, also known as “authorized [shares](../s/shares.md),” “authorized [capital stock](../c/capital_stock.md),” or “authorized [capital](../c/capital.md),” refers to the maximum number of [shares](../s/shares.md) that a [corporation](../c/corporation.md) is legally permitted to [issue](../i/issue.md), as stipulated in its articles of [incorporation](../i/incorporation.md). It is a critical concept within [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md) and the broader domain of [equity trading](../e/equity_trading.md). Understanding authorized stock is crucial for investors, company executives, and stakeholders as it provides insights into a [corporation](../c/corporation.md)'s [equity](../e/equity.md) structure and its potential for raising [capital](../c/capital.md).

## The Basics of Authorized Stock

When a [corporation](../c/corporation.md) is formed, its founders specify the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) that the company is authorized to [issue](../i/issue.md) in its charter documents. This figure represents the upper limit on the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) that can be distributed or sold to investors. Authorized stock includes both [issued shares](../i/issued_shares.md) (those that have been allocated to shareholders) and unissued [shares](../s/shares.md) (those that have not been distributed).

### Importance of Authorized Stock

1. **[Fund](../f/fund.md) Raising:** Authorized stock allows companies to raise [money](../m/money.md) by selling [shares](../s/shares.md). By issuing stock, companies can generate [capital](../c/capital.md) without incurring [debt](../d/debt.md).
2. **Control and Ownership:** The number of authorized [shares](../s/shares.md), combined with the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) issued and outstanding, helps determine control and ownership percentages among shareholders.
3. **Flexibility:** Having a large number of authorized [shares](../s/shares.md) provides flexibility to [issue](../i/issue.md) additional stock in the future, such as for raising [capital](../c/capital.md), employee stock [options](../o/options.md), or mergers and acquisitions.
4. **Regulatory Compliance:** Corporations must adhere to securities laws and stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md) regulations when issuing and selling [shares](../s/shares.md), making the concept of authorized stock integral to legal compliance.

### Authorized vs. Issued Shares

It's essential to distinguish between authorized [shares](../s/shares.md) and [issued shares](../i/issued_shares.md):

- **Authorized [Shares](../s/shares.md):** The total number of [shares](../s/shares.md) a company can [issue](../i/issue.md).
- **[Issued Shares](../i/issued_shares.md):** The subset of authorized [shares](../s/shares.md) that have been distributed to shareholders, either through public offerings, private placements, or other methods.

### Increasing Authorized Stock

A [corporation](../c/corporation.md) may decide to increase its authorized [shares](../s/shares.md) occasionally. Such a decision typically requires approval from the board of directors and a majority of shareholders. The process involves amending the articles of [incorporation](../i/incorporation.md) and filing the necessary documents with the relevant state authorities.

### Implications of Changes to Authorized Stock

Increasing or decreasing the number of authorized [shares](../s/shares.md) can have significant implications:

- **[Dilution](../d/dilution.md):** Issuing new [shares](../s/shares.md) can dilute the ownership percentage of existing shareholders, which may affect their voting power and dividends.
- **Stock Price Impact:** Announcements of new stock issuance can influence stock prices, as [market](../m/market.md) participants may react to the potential for [dilution](../d/dilution.md) or the perceived need for additional [capital](../c/capital.md).

## Corporate Governance and Authorized Stock

[Corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) plays a vital role in decisions regarding authorized stock. The board of directors and company executives must act in the best interests of the shareholders. [Transparency](../t/transparency.md) and clear communication regarding changes to authorized stock are crucial to maintaining [investor](../i/investor.md) confidence.

### Voting Rights

Shareholders typically have voting rights that allow them to approve or disapprove changes to authorized stock. These voting rights are exercised during [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) meetings, where resolutions related to stock issuance or changes to the [capital structure](../c/capital_structure.md) are presented.

### Executive Compensation and Stock Options

Many companies use stock [options](../o/options.md) as part of executive compensation packages. The availability of authorized but unissued [shares](../s/shares.md) enables companies to [offer](../o/offer.md) these [options](../o/options.md) without needing to seek additional approvals each time.

## Legal and Regulatory Framework

### State Corporate Laws

Each state in the U.S. has its own corporate laws governing authorized stock. For example, Delaware, known for its [business](../b/business.md)-friendly laws, requires corporations to specify their authorized stock in the certificate of [incorporation](../i/incorporation.md) and obtain [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) approval for any changes.

### Stock Exchanges

Stock exchanges, such as the New York Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (NYSE) and [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md), also have rules related to the issuance of stock. [Listed](../l/listed.md) companies must comply with these rules to maintain their listing status and ensure fair and orderly markets.

## Conclusion

Authorized stock is a fundamental [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md) concept that defines the maximum number of [shares](../s/shares.md) a company can [issue](../i/issue.md). It plays a critical role in [capital](../c/capital.md) raising, ownership structure, [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md), and regulatory compliance. By understanding the nuances of authorized stock, stakeholders can make informed decisions and better navigate the complexities of [equity](../e/equity.md) markets.

# Authorized Stock

Authorized stock, also known as “authorized shares,” “authorized capital stock,” or “authorized capital,” refers to the maximum number of shares that a corporation is legally permitted to issue, as stipulated in its articles of incorporation. It is a critical concept within corporate finance and the broader domain of equity trading. Understanding authorized stock is crucial for investors, company executives, and stakeholders as it provides insights into a corporation's equity structure and its potential for raising capital.

## The Basics of Authorized Stock

When a corporation is formed, its founders specify the number of shares that the company is authorized to issue in its charter documents. This figure represents the upper limit on the number of shares that can be distributed or sold to investors. Authorized stock includes both issued shares (those that have been allocated to shareholders) and unissued shares (those that have not been distributed).

### Importance of Authorized Stock

1. **Fund Raising:** Authorized stock allows companies to raise money by selling shares. By issuing stock, companies can generate capital without incurring debt.
2. **Control and Ownership:** The number of authorized shares, combined with the number of shares issued and outstanding, helps determine control and ownership percentages among shareholders.
3. **Flexibility:** Having a large number of authorized shares provides flexibility to issue additional stock in the future, such as for raising capital, employee stock options, or mergers and acquisitions.
4. **Regulatory Compliance:** Corporations must adhere to securities laws and stock exchange regulations when issuing and selling shares, making the concept of authorized stock integral to legal compliance.

### Authorized vs. Issued Shares

It's essential to distinguish between authorized shares and issued shares:

- **Authorized Shares:** The total number of shares a company can issue.
- **Issued Shares:** The subset of authorized shares that have been distributed to shareholders, either through public offerings, private placements, or other methods.

### Increasing Authorized Stock

A corporation may decide to increase its authorized shares occasionally. Such a decision typically requires approval from the board of directors and a majority of shareholders. The process involves amending the articles of incorporation and filing the necessary documents with the relevant state authorities.

### Implications of Changes to Authorized Stock

Increasing or decreasing the number of authorized shares can have significant implications:

- **Dilution:** Issuing new shares can dilute the ownership percentage of existing shareholders, which may affect their voting power and dividends.
- **Stock Price Impact:** Announcements of new stock issuance can influence stock prices, as market participants may react to the potential for dilution or the perceived need for additional capital.

## Corporate Governance and Authorized Stock

Corporate governance plays a vital role in decisions regarding authorized stock. The board of directors and company executives must act in the best interests of the shareholders. Transparency and clear communication regarding changes to authorized stock are crucial to maintaining investor confidence.

### Voting Rights

Shareholders typically have voting rights that allow them to approve or disapprove changes to authorized stock. These voting rights are exercised during shareholder meetings, where resolutions related to stock issuance or changes to the capital structure are presented.

### Executive Compensation and Stock Options

Many companies use stock options as part of executive compensation packages. The availability of authorized but unissued shares enables companies to offer these options without needing to seek additional approvals each time.

## Legal and Regulatory Framework

### Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)

In the United States, the SEC regulates the issuance and trading of securities, including authorized stock. Companies must file detailed reports and disclosures regarding their capital structure, ensuring transparency and protecting investors.

### State Corporate Laws

Each state in the U.S. has its own corporate laws governing authorized stock. For example, Delaware, known for its business-friendly laws, requires corporations to specify their authorized stock in the certificate of incorporation and obtain shareholder approval for any changes.

### Stock Exchanges

Stock exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq, also have rules related to the issuance of stock. Listed companies must comply with these rules to maintain their listing status and ensure fair and orderly markets.

# Automatic Premium Loan

An Automatic [Premium](../p/premium.md) [Loan](../l/loan.md) (APL) is a [provision](../p/provision.md) in some [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policies, typically found in [whole life insurance](../w/whole_life_insurance.md), which helps ensure the policy does not [lapse](../l/lapse.md) due to non-[payment](../p/payment.md) of premiums. If the policyholder fails to pay the [premium](../p/premium.md) by the due date, the insurer automatically borrows against the policy’s cash [value](../v/value.md) to pay the overdue [premium](../p/premium.md). This mechanism ensures that the policy remains in force, provided there is sufficient cash [value](../v/value.md) to cover the [premium](../p/premium.md) cost.

## Mechanism

### Policyholder's Benefit
The automatic [premium](../p/premium.md) [loan](../l/loan.md) clause is designed to protect the policyholder from unintentional lapses in coverage. It is especially valuable in whole life policies where the policy builds cash [value](../v/value.md) over time. Without this [provision](../p/provision.md), a missed [premium](../p/premium.md) [payment](../p/payment.md) might lead to the policy lapsing, which could be detrimental to the insured and their beneficiaries, depending on their [insurance](../i/insurance.md) needs and goals.

### Cash Value Loan
When an APL is activated, the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) company takes a [loan](../l/loan.md) from the policy’s accumulated cash [value](../v/value.md) to cover the unpaid [premium](../p/premium.md). This [loan](../l/loan.md) is subject to the terms outlined in the policy, including [interest](../i/interest.md) that [will](../w/will.md) [accrue](../a/accrue.md) on the borrowed amount. The [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) on the [loan](../l/loan.md) is usually specified in the policy and can be fixed or variable.

### Interest and Repayment
The [loan](../l/loan.md) plus any [accrued interest](../a/accrued_interest.md) reduces the [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) payable upon the policyholder's death if the [loan](../l/loan.md) is not repaid. Therefore, while an APL maintains the policy's active status, it’s crucial for policyholders to understand the implications of the [loan](../l/loan.md) and manage it accordingly.

### Automatic Nature
An essential aspect of the APL is its automatic nature – the policyholder is not required to initiate the [loan](../l/loan.md). This automatic feature ensures continuous coverage without the need for the policyholder to take immediate action in a [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) [shortfall](../s/shortfall.md) situation.

## Considerations in Using APL

### Sufficient Cash Value
For an APL to function, the policy must have sufficient cash [value](../v/value.md) to cover the unpaid premiums. If the cash [value](../v/value.md) is insufficient, the policy might still [lapse](../l/lapse.md). Whole life policies typically accumulate cash [value](../v/value.md) after the initial years of [premium](../p/premium.md) payments, [offering](../o/offering.md) a buffer for situations requiring an APL.

### Impact on Death Benefit
The [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) payable under the policy [will](../w/will.md) be reduced by any outstanding [loan](../l/loan.md) amount and the [accrued interest](../a/accrued_interest.md). Policyholders should be aware of this reduction as it affects the financial [security](../s/security.md) intended for their beneficiaries.

### Interest Accumulation
[Interest](../i/interest.md) on the APL [loan](../l/loan.md) continues to accumulate for as long as the [loan](../l/loan.md) remains unpaid. This can lead to a significant amount over time, which can substantially reduce the policy's cash [value](../v/value.md) and [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md).

## Managing APL Effectively

### Regular Review
Policyholders should regularly review their [whole life insurance](../w/whole_life_insurance.md) policy, paying special attention to [premium](../p/premium.md) payments and any available cash [value](../v/value.md). Keeping track of these elements helps in understanding the [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) of the policy and preempting any actions that might be required.

### Alternative Payment Arrangements
If faced with financial difficulties, policyholders might consider alternatives like lowering the [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md), using policy dividends to cover the premiums, or exploring other [payment](../p/payment.md) arrangements with the insurer to avoid depleting the cash [value](../v/value.md).

### Professional Advice
Consulting with a [financial advisor](../f/financial_advisor.md) or [insurance](../i/insurance.md) professional can provide clarity and strategies tailored to the individual's financial situation, helping ensure the policy remains beneficial and effective.

## Example

Let's illustrate an APL with an example.

Consider a policyholder with a [whole life insurance](../w/whole_life_insurance.md) policy that has built a cash [value](../v/value.md) of $10,000. The annual [premium](../p/premium.md) for this policy is $1,000. The policyholder encounters financial difficulties and misses the [premium](../p/premium.md) [payment](../p/payment.md) due date. Instead of the policy lapsing, the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) company automatically loans $1,000 from the cash [value](../v/value.md) to cover the [premium](../p/premium.md) [payment](../p/payment.md). This [loan](../l/loan.md) accrues [interest](../i/interest.md) at, say, 5% annually.

Now, the policyholder owes $1,000 plus 5% [interest](../i/interest.md) on this [loan](../l/loan.md). While the policy continues to provide the [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) protection, it's essential for the policyholder to manage this [loan](../l/loan.md) effectively to prevent the [loan](../l/loan.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) from eroding the cash [value](../v/value.md) and reducing the [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md).

# Available-for-Sale Security

## Introduction to Available-for-Sale Securities

Available-for-[Sale](../s/sale.md) (AFS) securities are a classification of financial assets, primarily used by companies and investors to categorize investments in [debt](../d/debt.md) or [equity](../e/equity.md) instruments that are not actively traded for [profit](../p/profit.md) but also not held to [maturity](../m/maturity.md). These securities are distinguished by their [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and accessibility, making them an integral part of a [balanced investment strategy](../b/balanced_investment_strategy.md). Under the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the Generally Accepted [Accounting Principles](../a/accounting_principles.md) (GAAP) in the United States, AFS securities receive special [accounting](../a/accounting.md) treatment, particularly in how their fair values are reported in [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md).

The primary motivation behind the AFS classification is to provide investors and companies with the flexibility to [liquidate](../l/liquidate.md) these investments if necessary, without the stringent restrictions associated with Held-to-[Maturity](../m/maturity.md) (HTM) investments. At the same time, they are not prone to frequent buying and selling, a characteristic of trading securities.

## Key Characteristics of Available-for-Sale Securities

1. **[Fair Value](../f/fair_value.md) Adjustment**: AFS securities are reported at their [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) on the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md). Any [unrealized gains](../u/unrealized_gains.md) or losses, which result from changes in the [market value](../m/market_value.md) of these securities, are not reflected in net [income](../i/income.md) but rather in other [comprehensive income](../c/comprehensive_income.md), a component of [equity](../e/equity.md).

2. **[Dividend](../d/dividend.md) and [Interest](../i/interest.md) [Income](../i/income.md)**: For [equity](../e/equity.md) securities classified as AFS, [dividend](../d/dividend.md) [income](../i/income.md) is recognized in the [income statement](../i/income_statement.md). Similarly, [interest](../i/interest.md) [income](../i/income.md) from [debt](../d/debt.md) securities is recorded in the [income statement](../i/income_statement.md).

3. **[Sale](../s/sale.md) of AFS Securities**: When AFS securities are sold, any realized gains or losses are recognized in the [income statement](../i/income_statement.md). This contrasts with the treatment of [unrealized gains](../u/unrealized_gains.md) and losses, which are reported in other [comprehensive income](../c/comprehensive_income.md) until realized.

4. **[Impairment](../i/impairment.md) of AFS Securities**: If there is evidence of a permanent decline in the [value](../v/value.md) of an AFS [security](../s/security.md), the [impairment](../i/impairment.md) loss is transferred from other [comprehensive income](../c/comprehensive_income.md) to the [income statement](../i/income_statement.md). This ensures that [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) accurately reflect any significant and long-lasting reductions in [value](../v/value.md).

## Accounting for Available-for-Sale Securities

### Initial Recognition

AFS securities are initially recorded at their purchase price, including any [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md) directly attributable to the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md). This is reflected as a [debit](../d/debit.md) in the Available-for-[Sale](../s/sale.md) Securities account and a [credit](../c/credit.md) to Cash or another appropriate account.

### Subsequent Measurement

After initial recognition, AFS securities are measured at [fair value](../f/fair_value.md). The ongoing adjustments to [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) are recorded in an account called "[Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income](../a/accumulated_other_comprehensive_income.md)" (AOCI), which is a subset of [equity](../e/equity.md). These adjustments do not affect the [income statement](../i/income_statement.md) unless the [security](../s/security.md) is sold or deemed to be impaired.

### Reporting on Financial Statements

1. **[Balance Sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md)**: AFS securities are presented at [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) under current or non-[current assets](../c/current_assets.md), depending on the company's intention regarding the [duration](../d/duration.md) of holding these investments.

2. **[Income Statement](../i/income_statement.md)**: Dividends earned from AFS [equity](../e/equity.md) securities and [interest](../i/interest.md) [income](../i/income.md) from AFS [debt](../d/debt.md) securities are included in the [income statement](../i/income_statement.md). Realized gains or losses from the [sale](../s/sale.md) of AFS securities are also reported here.

3. **[Comprehensive Income](../c/comprehensive_income.md) Statement**: This statement includes the effects of changes in [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) of AFS securities, showcasing [unrealized gains](../u/unrealized_gains.md) or losses in the period they occur.

## Financial Reporting Standards

### IFRS

Under IFRS, the [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for AFS securities falls under IAS 39 and IFRS 9, the latter of which came into effect starting January 1, 2018. IFRS 9 introduced a shift in the classification and measurement model for financial instruments. It eliminated the AFS category, replacing it with a more principles-based approach and introducing categories like "[Fair Value](../f/fair_value.md) Through [Profit](../p/profit.md) or Loss" (FVTPL) and "[Fair Value](../f/fair_value.md) Through Other [Comprehensive Income](../c/comprehensive_income.md)" (FVTOCI).

### U.S. GAAP

Under U.S. GAAP, the [accounting](../a/accounting.md) treatment for AFS securities is prescribed by ASC 320, which specifies the classification, recognition, measurement, and reporting of investments in [debt](../d/debt.md) and [equity](../e/equity.md) securities. The principles set out in ASC 320 align closely with the initial provisions of IAS 39, although differences exist due to the regulatory environments and reporting benchmarks in the U.S. and other jurisdictions.

## Strategic Use of AFS Securities in Investment Portfolios

AFS securities play a strategic role in investment portfolios, particularly in terms of [diversification](../d/diversification.md) and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md):

1. **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: By holding AFS securities, investors can achieve a diversified portfolio, mitigating risks associated with [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and specific [asset](../a/asset.md) classes.

2. **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) Management**: AFS securities provide a balance between [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and [return](../r/return.md). While they are not as [liquid](../l/liquid.md) as trading securities, they [offer](../o/offer.md) more flexibility compared to held-to-[maturity](../m/maturity.md) investments.

3. **[Optimization](../o/optimization.md) of Returns**: Investors can optimize returns through strategic sales when [market](../m/market.md) conditions are favorable, capitalizing on [unrealized gains](../u/unrealized_gains.md) recorded in other [comprehensive income](../c/comprehensive_income.md).

## Case Examples

### Financial Institutions

Financial institutions, such as banks and [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies, frequently [hold](../h/hold.md) AFS securities as part of their investment portfolios. For example, JPMorgan Chase (https://www.jpmorganchase.com/) utilizes AFS securities to manage [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and optimize their investment returns while maintaining regulatory compliance on [capital](../c/capital.md) reserves.

### Corporate Investments

Corporations often [hold](../h/hold.md) AFS securities as part of their treasury management strategy. For example, Alphabet Inc. (https://abc.xyz/) may invest [surplus](../s/surplus.md) cash in AFS securities to earn a [return](../r/return.md) on idle cash while retaining the flexibility to [liquidate](../l/liquidate.md) these assets when [capital](../c/capital.md) is required for operational or strategic purposes.

## Comparison with Other Financial Assets

### Trading Securities

- **Frequency of Trading**: Trading securities are actively bought and sold, with profits and losses reported in the [income statement](../i/income_statement.md).
- **Measurement**: Trading securities are always measured at [fair value](../f/fair_value.md), with [unrealized gains](../u/unrealized_gains.md) and losses impacting net [income](../i/income.md) directly.

### Held-to-Maturity Investments

- **Intention and [Holding Period](../h/holding_period.md)**: HTM investments are intended to be held until [maturity](../m/maturity.md), with [interest](../i/interest.md) [income](../i/income.md) recognized over the life of the investment.
- **Measurement**: HTM investments are measured at amortized cost unless they are sold before [maturity](../m/maturity.md), which could lead to reclassification and impact future holding capacities.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

1. **Flexibility**: AFS securities [offer](../o/offer.md) the flexibility to be sold in response to changes in [market](../m/market.md) conditions or investment strategies.
2. **[Balance Sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) Strength**: Recording AFS securities at [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) provides [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and reflects the current [market value](../m/market_value.md) of investments.
3. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: By recording [unrealized gains](../u/unrealized_gains.md) and losses in other [comprehensive income](../c/comprehensive_income.md), companies can manage [earnings](../e/earnings.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and provide a more stable [income statement](../i/income_statement.md).

### Disadvantages

1. **Complex [Accounting](../a/accounting.md)**: The [accounting](../a/accounting.md) processes for AFS securities involve complex [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) assessments and tracking of [unrealized gains](../u/unrealized_gains.md) and losses.
2. **Impact of [Market](../m/market.md) Fluctuations**: Significant [market](../m/market.md) fluctuations impacting the [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) of AFS securities can create [volatility](../v/volatility.md) in [equity](../e/equity.md) through the AOCI.

## Conclusion

Available-for-[Sale](../s/sale.md) securities serve as a versatile and strategic component of investment portfolios, [offering](../o/offering.md) a balance between [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and returns while providing companies and investors with flexibility in managing their assets. The nuanced [accounting](../a/accounting.md) treatment for AFS securities ensures that [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) reflect the true [economic value](../e/economic_value.md) of investments while avoiding undue [earnings](../e/earnings.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md). Understanding the fundamental principles of AFS securities, along with their strategic applications, allows investors and companies to [leverage](../l/leverage.md) these financial instruments effectively within the broader context of their financial management and reporting objectives.

# Acid-Test Ratio

The acid-test ratio, also known as the [quick ratio](../q/quick_ratio.md), is a financial metric used to evaluate a company's short-term [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and ability to meet its immediate [obligations](../o/obligation.md) without relying on the [sale](../s/sale.md) of [inventory](../i/inventory.md). It is a stringent measure that includes only the most [liquid](../l/liquid.md) assetsâ€”those that can be quickly converted into cash. The formula for the acid-test ratio is:

\[ \text{Acid-Test Ratio} = \frac{\text{(Cash \& Cash Equivalents + [Marketable Securities](../m/marketable_securities.md) + Accounts [Receivable](../r/receivable.md))}}{\text{[Current Liabilities](../c/current_liabilities.md)}} \]

## Components of the Acid-Test Ratio

### 1. Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and [cash equivalents](../c/cash_equivalents.md) are the most [liquid](../l/liquid.md) assets on a company's [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) and include physical [currency](../c/currency.md), [bank](../b/bank.md) account balances, and [short-term investments](../s/short-term_investments.md) that can be quickly converted into cash. These assets can be used immediately to meet financial [obligations](../o/obligation.md).

### 2. Marketable Securities
[Marketable securities](../m/marketable_securities.md) are [liquid](../l/liquid.md) financial instruments that can be quickly converted into cash at a reasonable price. Examples include [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, and other [short-term investments](../s/short-term_investments.md). These securities are considered near-cash assets and are included in the acid-test ratio calculation due to their [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).

### 3. Accounts Receivable
Accounts [receivable](../r/receivable.md) represent [money](../m/money.md) owed to the company by its customers for goods or services already delivered but not yet paid for. These amounts are expected to be received within a short period, typically within 30 to 90 days, making them relatively [liquid](../l/liquid.md) assets.

### 4. Current Liabilities
[Current liabilities](../c/current_liabilities.md) are short-term debts and [obligations](../o/obligation.md) that a company must pay within one year. These liabilities include accounts payable, short-term loans, accrued expenses, and other similar [obligations](../o/obligation.md). The acid-test ratio compares the company's [liquid](../l/liquid.md) assets to these [current liabilities](../c/current_liabilities.md) to evaluate its short-term [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).

## Interpretation of the Acid-Test Ratio

### High Acid-Test Ratio
When the acid-test ratio is greater than 1, it indicates that the company has more [liquid](../l/liquid.md) assets than [current liabilities](../c/current_liabilities.md), suggesting strong short-term [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and the ability to meet its immediate [obligations](../o/obligation.md) without selling [inventory](../i/inventory.md).

### Low Acid-Test Ratio
A ratio less than 1 suggests that the company may struggle to cover its short-term liabilities with its most [liquid](../l/liquid.md) assets. This could indicate potential [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) issues, which may lead to [financial distress](../f/financial_distress.md) if not addressed.

### Optimal Acid-Test Ratio
While a higher acid-test ratio is generally favorable, it is crucial to strike a balance. An excessively high ratio could suggest that the company is not effectively utilizing its [liquid](../l/liquid.md) assets to generate returns, indicating potential inefficiency in [asset management](../a/asset_management.md).

## Importance in Financial Analysis

The acid-test ratio is a critical tool for investors, creditors, and analysts to assess a company's [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and [risk](../r/risk.md) profile. It provides insight into the company's ability to manage its operations without relying on [inventory](../i/inventory.md) sales, which may be less predictable and more time-consuming.

### Investors
Investors use the acid-test ratio to evaluate the [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and financial stability of a company. A healthy ratio suggests that the company can sustain its operations and meet short-term [obligations](../o/obligation.md), making it a safer investment.

### Creditors
Creditors, such as banks and suppliers, assess the acid-test ratio to determine the company's [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) and ability to repay short-term debts. A strong ratio suggests lower [risk](../r/risk.md) and may lead to favorable lending terms.

### Analysts
Financial analysts incorporate the acid-test ratio into broader [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md) to provide a comprehensive assessment of a company's [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md). It complements other ratios and financial metrics to create a more detailed picture of the company's financial position.

## Limitations of the Acid-Test Ratio

### Exclusion of Inventory
One of the primary limitations of the acid-test ratio is the exclusion of [inventory](../i/inventory.md). For companies with significant [inventory](../i/inventory.md) levels, such as retail or [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) businesses, this exclusion may not provide a complete picture of [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).

### Industry Variations
Different industries have varying [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) requirements and operating cycles, which can influence the acid-test ratio. Therefore, it is essential to compare the ratio to [industry](../i/industry.md) benchmarks and competitors to draw meaningful conclusions.

### Timing of Accounts Receivable
The acid-test ratio relies on accounts [receivable](../r/receivable.md), which may not always be collected on time. Delays in receivables can affect the company's [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and skew the ratio.

## Example Calculation

Consider a company with the following financial data:
- Cash and [Cash Equivalents](../c/cash_equivalents.md): $50,000
- [Marketable Securities](../m/marketable_securities.md): $30,000
- Accounts [Receivable](../r/receivable.md): $70,000
- [Current Liabilities](../c/current_liabilities.md): $100,000

The acid-test ratio can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Acid-Test Ratio} = \frac{50,000 + 30,000 + 70,000}{100,000} = \frac{150,000}{100,000} = 1.5 \]

This ratio of 1.5 indicates that the company has $1.50 in [liquid](../l/liquid.md) assets for every $1.00 of [current liabilities](../c/current_liabilities.md), suggesting strong short-term [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).

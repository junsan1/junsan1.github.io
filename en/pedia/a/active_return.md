# Active return

Active [return](../r/return.md) is a measure of the performance of an investment portfolio relative to a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md). It is the difference between the actual [return](../r/return.md) of the portfolio and the [return](../r/return.md) of the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md). Active [return](../r/return.md) captures the [value added](../v/value_added.md) or subtracted by the [portfolio manager](../p/portfolio_manager.md)'s investment decisions. Below, we [will](../w/will.md) delve deeper into the concept of active [return](../r/return.md), its calculation, significance, and its role in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md).

### Definition

Active [return](../r/return.md) can be mathematically defined as:

\[ \text{Active [Return](../r/return.md)} = R_p - R_b \]

where:
- \( R_p \) is the [return](../r/return.md) on the portfolio.
- \( R_b \) is the [return](../r/return.md) on the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md).

The result can be positive or negative. A positive active [return](../r/return.md) indicates that the portfolio outperformed the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md), while a negative active [return](../r/return.md) indicates underperformance.

### Calculation

To calculate active [return](../r/return.md), one must first choose an appropriate [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md). Benchmarks are chosen based on the [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) and [asset class](../a/asset_class.md) of the portfolio. Common benchmarks include stock indices like the S&P 500, FTSE 100, or [bond](../b/bond.md) indices like the Barclays Aggregate [Bond](../b/bond.md) [Index](../i/index.md).

Suppose a portfolio has an [annual return](../a/annual_return.md) of 10%, and the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [index](../i/index.md) has an [annual return](../a/annual_return.md) of 7%. The active [return](../r/return.md) would be:

\[ \text{Active [Return](../r/return.md)} = 10\% - 7\% = 3\% \]

This indicates that the [portfolio manager](../p/portfolio_manager.md)’s decisions added 3% of [value](../v/value.md) above the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md).

### Components of Active Return

Active [return](../r/return.md) can be decomposed into two components:

1. **[Security Selection](../s/security_selection.md) [Return](../r/return.md)**: This component measures the contribution to the active [return](../r/return.md) from selecting specific securities within an [asset class](../a/asset_class.md). It reflects the [portfolio manager](../p/portfolio_manager.md)'s ability to choose outperforming securities.

2. **[Asset Allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) [Return](../r/return.md)**: This component measures the contribution to the active [return](../r/return.md) from the [portfolio manager](../p/portfolio_manager.md)’s decision on the allocation of [capital](../c/capital.md) between different [asset](../a/asset.md) classes. It reflects the ability to [overweight](../o/overweight.md) or [underweight](../u/underweight.md) certain [asset](../a/asset.md) categories relative to the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md).

### Significance

- **Performance Measurement**: Active [return](../r/return.md) is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of [active management](../a/active_management.md). It shows whether the active decisions made by the [portfolio manager](../p/portfolio_manager.md) have added [value](../v/value.md) relative to a passive [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md).
  
- **Reward and Incentive Structures**: [Fund](../f/fund.md) managers and [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds often structure their fees and incentives based on active [return](../r/return.md). Performance-based bonuses and management fees can be linked to how well they [outperform](../o/outperform.md) the [market](../m/market.md).

- **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Assessment**: The pursuit of active [return](../r/return.md) can involve taking on additional [risk](../r/risk.md). Analyzing active [return](../r/return.md) alongside [risk metrics](../r/risk_metrics.md) like [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md), [beta](../b/beta.md), and [alpha](../a/alpha.md) helps in understanding whether higher returns are achieved through higher [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Active Return in Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), or algo-trading, uses computer algorithms to [trade](../t/trade.md) securities automatically. These algorithms can be designed to generate active [return](../r/return.md) by implementing various [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). The key to success in algo-trading lies in the ability to exploit [market](../m/market.md) inefficiencies and generate returns that exceed a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md).

#### Steps to Achieve Active Return in Algo-Trading:

1. **Strategy Development**: Algo-traders develop strategies based on [quantitative analysis](../q/quantitative_analysis.md), [financial modeling](../f/financial_modeling.md), and statistical methods. These strategies identify entry and exit points and determine position sizes.

2. **[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md)**: Before deploying an algorithm in live trading, it is essential to backtest it against historical data. This helps in assessing how the algorithm would have performed and whether it would have generated positive active returns.

3. **[Execution](../e/execution.md)**: [High-frequency trading algorithms](../h/high-frequency_trading_algorithms.md) can execute trades in fractions of a second. Efficient [execution](../e/execution.md) minimizes [slippage](../s/slippage.md) and ensures that the algorithm takes advantage of [market](../m/market.md) opportunities.

4. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Algorithms incorporate [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) rules to control exposure to [market](../m/market.md) risks. This includes setting stop-loss levels, [portfolio diversification](../p/portfolio_diversification.md), and adhering to [leverage](../l/leverage.md) limits.

5. **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring and adjustment of algorithms ensure they remain effective in changing [market](../m/market.md) conditions. [Performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md), including active [return](../r/return.md), are used to refine and improve strategies.

#### Key Players in Algorithmic Trading

### Challenges

Generating positive active returns consistently is challenging due to several factors:

- **[Market Efficiency](../m/market_efficiency.md)**: Efficient markets make it difficult to find and exploit mispricings. As more participants use [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), available [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) opportunities diminish.

- **[Transaction Costs](../t/transaction_costs.md)**: High-frequency trading can incur significant [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md), which can erode the potential active [return](../r/return.md).

- **[Model Risk](../m/model_risk.md)**: Algorithms are based on historical data, and there is a [risk](../r/risk.md) that [market](../m/market.md) conditions [will](../w/will.md) change, rendering the models ineffective.

- **Regulatory Changes**: Financial regulations can impact how [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) is conducted, adding another layer of complexity.

### Conclusion

Active [return](../r/return.md) is a fundamental concept in [investment management](../i/investment_management.md) that measures the [value added](../v/value_added.md) by [active management](../a/active_management.md). In the context of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), active [return](../r/return.md) quantifies the success of [proprietary trading](../p/proprietary_trading.md) strategies and their ability to [outperform](../o/outperform.md) benchmarks. While challenging, successful [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) firms [leverage](../l/leverage.md) sophisticated models, technology, and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices to achieve and sustain positive active returns.

title: Active Return
---

# Active return is a measure of the performance of an investment portfolio relative to a benchmark. It is the difference between the actual return of the portfolio and the return of the benchmark. Active return captures the value added or subtracted by the portfolio manager's investment decisions. Below, we will delve deeper into the concept of active return, its calculation, significance, and its role in algorithmic trading.

### Definition

Active return can be mathematically defined as:

\[ \text{Active Return} = R_p - R_b \]

where:
- \( R_p \) is the return on the portfolio.
- \( R_b \) is the return on the benchmark.

The result can be positive or negative. A positive active return indicates that the portfolio outperformed the benchmark, while a negative active return indicates underperformance.

### Calculation

To calculate active return, one must first choose an appropriate benchmark. Benchmarks are chosen based on the investment strategy and asset class of the portfolio. Common benchmarks include stock indices like the S&P 500, FTSE 100, or bond indices like the Barclays Aggregate Bond Index.

Suppose a portfolio has an annual return of 10%, and the benchmark index has an annual return of 7%. The active return would be:

\[ \text{Active Return} = 10\% - 7\% = 3\% \]

This indicates that the portfolio manager’s decisions added 3% of value above the benchmark.

### Components of Active Return

Active return can be decomposed into two components:

1. **Security Selection Return**: This component measures the contribution to the active return from selecting specific securities within an asset class. It reflects the portfolio manager's ability to choose outperforming securities.

2. **Asset Allocation Return**: This component measures the contribution to the active return from the portfolio manager’s decision on the allocation of capital between different asset classes. It reflects the ability to overweight or underweight certain asset categories relative to the benchmark.

### Significance

- **Performance Measurement**: Active return is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of active management. It shows whether the active decisions made by the portfolio manager have added value relative to a passive investment strategy.
  
- **Reward and Incentive Structures**: Fund managers and hedge funds often structure their fees and incentives based on active return. Performance-based bonuses and management fees can be linked to how well they outperform the market.

- **Risk Assessment**: The pursuit of active return can involve taking on additional risk. Analyzing active return alongside risk metrics like standard deviation, beta, and alpha helps in understanding whether higher returns are achieved through higher risk.

### Active Return in Algorithmic Trading

Algorithmic trading, or algo-trading, uses computer algorithms to trade securities automatically. These algorithms can be designed to generate active return by implementing various trading strategies. The key to success in algo-trading lies in the ability to exploit market inefficiencies and generate returns that exceed a benchmark.

#### Steps to Achieve Active Return in Algo-Trading:

1. **Strategy Development**: Algo-traders develop strategies based on quantitative analysis, financial modeling, and statistical methods. These strategies identify entry and exit points and determine position sizes.

2. **Backtesting**: Before deploying an algorithm in live trading, it is essential to backtest it against historical data. This helps in assessing how the algorithm would have performed and whether it would have generated positive active returns.

3. **Execution**: High-frequency trading algorithms can execute trades in fractions of a second. Efficient execution minimizes slippage and ensures that the algorithm takes advantage of market opportunities.

4. **Risk Management**: Algorithms incorporate risk management rules to control exposure to market risks. This includes setting stop-loss levels, portfolio diversification, and adhering to leverage limits.

5. **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring and adjustment of algorithms ensure they remain effective in changing market conditions. Performance metrics, including active return, are used to refine and improve strategies.

### Challenges

Generating positive active returns consistently is challenging due to several factors:

- **Market Efficiency**: Efficient markets make it difficult to find and exploit mispricings. As more participants use algorithmic trading, available arbitrage opportunities diminish.

- **Transaction Costs**: High-frequency trading can incur significant transaction costs, which can erode the potential active return.

- **Model Risk**: Algorithms are based on historical data, and there is a risk that market conditions will change, rendering the models ineffective.

- **Regulatory Changes**: Financial regulations can impact how algorithmic trading is conducted, adding another layer of complexity.

### Conclusion

Active return is a fundamental concept in investment management that measures the value added by active management. In the context of algorithmic trading, active return quantifies the success of proprietary trading strategies and their ability to outperform benchmarks. While challenging, successful algorithmic trading firms leverage sophisticated models, technology, and risk management practices to achieve and sustain positive active returns.

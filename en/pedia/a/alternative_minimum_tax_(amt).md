# Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)

The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) is a supplemental [income tax](../i/income_tax.md) imposed by the United States federal government. The primary purpose of the AMT is to ensure that individuals, corporations, trusts, and estates with substantial [income](../i/income.md) do not avoid paying [federal income](../f/federal_income.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) by exploiting deductions and exemptions. This tax system runs parallel to the regular [income tax](../i/income_tax.md) system, requiring taxpayers to calculate their tax liabilities under both regimes and pay the higher of the two.

## History and Purpose

The AMT was introduced in 1969 to address concerns that wealthy taxpayers were using various deductions and exclusions to significantly reduce or eliminate their [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md). Initially, the AMT applied to a small number of high-[income](../i/income.md) taxpayers. However, over the years, [inflation](../i/inflation.md) and legislative changes have expanded its reach, causing it to impact many middle-[income](../i/income.md) taxpayers as well.

## How AMT is Calculated

Calculating the AMT involves several steps:

1. **Compute Regular [Taxable Income](../t/taxable_income.md)**: Start with the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md)'s regular [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md).
2. **Add Back Preference Items**: Certain tax preference items, such as the [standard deduction](../s/standard_deduction.md), personal exemptions, and specific itemized deductions, are added back to the [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md). Other preferences include [tax-exempt interest](../t/tax-exempt_interest.md) from private activity bonds and certain [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) deductions.
3. **Apply AMT Adjustments**: Additional adjustments are made for items such as incentive stock [options](../o/options.md), passive activities, and certain credits.
4. **Calculate AMT [Income](../i/income.md) (AMTI)**: The result after these adjustments and preference items is the Alternative Minimum [Taxable Income](../t/taxable_income.md) (AMTI).
5. **Apply AMT [Exemption](../e/exemption.md)**: Subtract the AMT [exemption](../e/exemption.md) amount, which varies based on [filing status](../f/filing_status.md) and is subject to phase-out at higher [income](../i/income.md) levels.
6. **AMT Rates**: Apply the AMT tax rates (26% or 28%) to the remaining AMTI.
7. **Determine AMT [Liability](../l/liability.md)**: The AMT [liability](../l/liability.md) is compared to the regular [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md). If the AMT [liability](../l/liability.md) is higher, the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) pays the difference as the AMT.

## Significant AMT Components

- **AMT [Exemption](../e/exemption.md)**: A certain amount of [income](../i/income.md) is exempt from the AMT, which varies annually and depends on [filing status](../f/filing_status.md). The [exemption](../e/exemption.md) phases out at higher [income](../i/income.md) levels.
- **AMT Preferences and Adjustments**: These include specific deductions and [income](../i/income.md) adjustments that are not allowed under the AMT. Examples include:
  - Medical expenses [deduction](../d/deduction.md) thresholds.
  - State and [local tax](../l/local_tax.md) deductions.
  - Miscellaneous itemized deductions.
  - [Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) on certain assets.
- **AMT Rates**: The AMT applies a two-tiered rate system:
  - 26% on the first portion of [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md).
  - 28% on amounts exceeding a specified limit.

## Impact on Taxpayers

The AMT can have several significant effects on taxpayers, including:

- **Increased [Tax Liability](../t/tax_liability.md)**: Taxpayers subject to the AMT may find their [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md) notably higher than anticipated due to the inclusion of preference items and disallowed deductions.
- **Complex Calculations**: The AMT calculations can be complex and time-consuming, often requiring taxpayers to seek professional tax preparation services.
- **[Retirement Planning](../r/retirement_planning.md)**: Certain retirement contributions and distributions, like incentive stock [options](../o/options.md), might be impacted by the AMT rules.

## AMT Reform and Legislative Changes

Over the years, there have been numerous discussions and legislative efforts to reform or eliminate the AMT. Notable changes include:

- **The [Tax Reform Act of 1986](../t/tax_reform_act_of_1986.md)**: This act significantly expanded the reach of the AMT by altering deductions and exemptions.
- **The American [Taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) Relief Act of 2012**: This introduced a permanent AMT [exemption](../e/exemption.md) amount, indexed for [inflation](../i/inflation.md), to reduce the impact on middle-[income](../i/income.md) taxpayers.
- **The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA)**: This act significantly raised the AMT [exemption](../e/exemption.md) amounts and increased the phase-out thresholds, reducing the number of taxpayers subject to the AMT.

## AMT and Corporations

Corporations may also be subject to the AMT. The calculation for corporations involves different adjustments and preference items, as well as unique [exemption](../e/exemption.md) amounts and rates.

## Conclusion

The Alternative Minimum Tax ensures a [baseline](../b/baseline.md) tax contribution from high-[income](../i/income.md) individuals and entities, preventing the overuse of deductions and exclusions. It complements the regular tax system, maintaining fairness and [revenue](../r/revenue.md) generation in the federal tax structure. Understanding the AMT's intricacies is crucial for affected taxpayers to manage their tax liabilities effectively.

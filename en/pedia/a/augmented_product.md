# Augmented Product

In the realm of product theory, the concept of an augmented product is critical for understanding how companies can differentiate their offerings by adding extra features and services that go beyond the basic function of the product itself. Going beyond the core product, an augmented product provides additional [value](../v/value.md) that can appeal to target customers, enhancing their overall satisfaction and experience with the product.

## Core Product vs. Augmented Product

### Core Product
The core product is essentially what the [customer](../c/customer.md) is actually buying. It represents the primary benefit or the main [utility](../u/utility.md) that a product offers. For example, if a [customer](../c/customer.md) buys a smartphone, the core product would be the ability to make calls, send text messages, and access the internet.

### Augmented Product
The augmented product, on the other hand, includes additional features and services that add [value](../v/value.md) to the core product. These may include warranties, [customer service](../c/customer_service.md), free delivery, installation, user manuals, and more. Using the smartphone example, the augmented product might include a [warranty](../w/warranty.md) period, 24/7 [customer](../c/customer.md) support, free accessories like headphones or chargers, and software updates.

## Importance of Augmented Products

Augmented products are crucial for differentiation in competitive markets. When many companies [offer](../o/offer.md) similar core products, augmentations can set one product apart from the others. This can be particularly important in markets where the core products have become commoditized. Here, companies must find other ways to add [value](../v/value.md) and make their products more attractive to consumers.

### Customer Loyalty
By [offering](../o/offering.md) an augmented product, companies can foster [customer](../c/customer.md) loyalty. Enhanced features and superior [customer service](../c/customer_service.md) create a better overall experience, which can lead to repeat purchases and positive word-of-mouth.

### Brand Perception
An augmented product can also enhance brand perception. Customers may associate a brand with high quality not only because of the core product but also because of the additional benefits they receive.

### Higher Price Point
Augmented products often justify a higher price point. Customers are usually willing to pay more for a product that offers additional services and enhanced features, seeing the overall package as a better deal.

## Components of an Augmented Product

### Warranties and Guarantees
These provide customers with peace of mind by ensuring that any defects [will](../w/will.md) be addressed without additional cost. For example, Apple offers a one-year limited [warranty](../w/warranty.md) on its products, which can be extended with AppleCare+.

### Customer Support
24/7 [customer](../c/customer.md) support can be a critical feature of an augmented product. Quality [customer service](../c/customer_service.md) can make a huge difference in [customer](../c/customer.md) satisfaction. Companies like Amazon have built their reputation, in part, on exceptional [customer service](../c/customer_service.md).

### Delivery and Installation
Free delivery and installation services add convenience for the [customer](../c/customer.md), making the purchasing experience smoother and more enjoyable. IKEA, for example, offers various delivery and assembly services to enhance their product offerings.

### User Manuals and Tutorials
Comprehensive user manuals and tutorials can significantly improve a [customer](../c/customer.md)'s ability to make full use of their purchase. Companies like Microsoft provide extensive documentation and online tutorials for their software products.

### Software Updates
Regular software updates can keep a product relevant and up to date. For instance, Tesla continuously rolls out over-the-air software updates to enhance the features and performance of their vehicles.

### Premium Packaging
High-quality, attractive packaging can be a part of the augmented product, making the experience of unboxing enjoyable. Apple has set a standard in the tech [industry](../i/industry.md) for its meticulously designed product packaging.

## Case Studies

### Apple Inc.
Apple’s products are a textbook example of extremely well-executed augmented products. Beyond the core function of their devices, Apple adds considerable [value](../v/value.md) through features like iCloud storage, regular software updates, integration within their ecosystem, and extensive [customer](../c/customer.md) support through AppleCare. These augmented features contribute to the higher price point of Apple products and the brand’s strong [customer](../c/customer.md) loyalty.

### Amazon
Amazon goes beyond [offering](../o/offering.md) a platform for buying and selling products by adding [value](../v/value.md) through services like Amazon Prime, which includes benefits such as free two-day shipping, streaming services, and exclusive deals. Their exceptional [customer service](../c/customer_service.md), comprehensive [return](../r/return.md) policy, and easy-to-navigate website further enhance the augmented product experience.

### Tesla
Tesla doesn’t just sell electric vehicles; they sell a futuristic driving experience complete with over-the-air software updates, a [robust](../r/robust.md) network of Superchargers for convenient long-distance travel, and a dedicated [customer service](../c/customer_service.md) team. These features turn the simple core product—an electric car—into an augmented product that stands out in the automotive [industry](../i/industry.md).

## Conclusion

The concept of an augmented product is not just about additional features but about enhancing the overall [customer](../c/customer.md) experience. Companies that understand and effectively implement this concept can achieve differentiation, increase [customer](../c/customer.md) loyalty, and justify higher price points for their products. The augmented product strategy involves a deep understanding of [customer](../c/customer.md) needs and continuous innovation to add meaningful [value](../v/value.md) beyond the core product.

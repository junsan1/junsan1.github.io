# Advanced Technical Analysis

[Technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) is a method used to evaluate and predict the future price movements of financial instruments, such as stocks, currencies, or commodities, by analyzing past market data, primarily price and volume data. Advanced [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) goes a step further, employing more complex indicators, patterns, and techniques to gain deeper insights and enhance [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). This comprehensive guide will delve into the various aspects, tools, and methodologies involved in advanced [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md).

### 1. Depth of Market (DOM)

Depth of Market, often referred to as the order book, is a tool that shows the volume of buy and sell orders for a particular financial instrument at various price levels. This allows traders to gauge the supply and demand dynamics, providing insights into potential price movements. Traders can identify significant [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels, assess market liquidity, and detect possible manipulation.

### 2. Volume Analysis

[Volume analysis](../v/volume_analysis.md) involves interpreting trading volumes to assess the strength or weakness of a price movement. Higher trading volumes often indicate stronger price trends, while lower volumes may signal a lack of conviction. Key volume-based indicators include:

- **On-Balance Volume (OBV)**: OBV measures cumulative buying and selling pressure by adding the volume on up days and subtracting it on down days.
- **Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)**: VWAP is the average price a security has traded at throughout the day, weighted by volume.

### 3. Chart Patterns

[Advanced chart patterns](../a/advanced_chart_patterns.md) are formations that emerge in price charts, which can indicate potential future price movements based on historical trends. Some of the most important [advanced chart patterns](../a/advanced_chart_patterns.md) include:

- **Head and Shoulders**: This reversal pattern indicates a change from bullish to bearish trend or vice versa. It consists of three peaks: a higher peak between two lower peaks, resembling a head and shoulders.
- **Double Top and Double Bottom**: These are classic [reversal patterns](../r/reversal_patterns.md). A double top signals a bearish reversal after reaching a resistance level twice, while a double bottom indicates a bullish reversal after hitting a support level twice.
- **Triangles (Ascending, Descending, and Symmetrical)**: These [continuation patterns](../c/continuation_patterns.md) indicate periods of consolidation before a continuation of the prevailing trend.

### 4. Advanced Candlesticks

[Candlestick patterns](../c/candlestick_patterns.md) are essential tools in [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md). Advanced [candlestick patterns](../c/candlestick_patterns.md) provide deeper insights into market sentiment and potential reversals. Some key patterns include:

- **Engulfing Pattern**: A [bullish engulfing pattern](../b/bullish_engulfing_pattern.md) takes place when a small bearish candlestick is followed by a larger bullish candlestick that completely engulfs it. A [bearish engulfing pattern](../b/bearish_engulfing_pattern.md) occurs when a small bullish candlestick is followed by a larger bearish candlestick.
- **Doji**: A doji candle forms when the open and close prices are virtually the same, signifying indecision or a potential reversal in the market.
- **Hammer and Hanging Man**: A hammer indicates a potential bullish reversal after a downtrend, characterized by a small body and a long lower shadow. The hanging man signals a potential bearish reversal after an uptrend, with similar characteristics to the hammer.

### 5. Technical Indicators

[Technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) are mathematical calculations based on price, volume, or open interest data. Advanced [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) help traders to make more informed decisions. Some popular advanced indicators include:

- **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: RSI measures the speed and change of price movements, ranging from 0 to 100. A value above 70 typically indicates overbought conditions, while a value below 30 suggests oversold conditions.
- **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**: MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages. The MACD line is the difference between a 26-period and 12-period EMA, and the signal line is a 9-period EMA of the MACD line.
- **[Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md)**: [Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md) consist of a middle band (a simple moving average) and an upper and lower band (standard deviations from the middle band). They provide a visual representation of volatility and potential price breakouts.

### 6. Fibonacci Analysis

Fibonacci analysis involves using mathematical ratios derived from the Fibonacci sequence to identify potential [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels. Key Fibonacci levels include 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8%, which often coincide with significant price reversal points. Traders use Fibonacci retracement and extension tools to project potential price targets and entry/exit points.

### 7. Elliott Wave Theory

[Elliott Wave Theory](../e/elliott_wave_theory.md), developed by Ralph Nelson Elliott, is a form of [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) that identifies recurring wave patterns to predict market trends. The theory consists of two types of waves: impulse waves (in the direction of the trend) and corrective waves (against the trend). [Elliott Wave patterns](../e/elliott_wave_patterns.md) help traders understand the cyclical nature of markets and anticipate future price movements.

### 8. Ichimoku Cloud

The Ichimoku Kinko Hyo, or [Ichimoku Cloud](../i/ichimoku_cloud.md), is a comprehensive technical indicator that provides information on support/resistance levels, trend direction, and momentum. It consists of five main components:

- **Tenkan-sen (Conversion Line)**: The average of the highest high and lowest low over the previous 9 periods.
- **Kijun-sen (Base Line)**: The average of the highest high and lowest low over the previous 26 periods.
- **Senkou Span A (Leading Span A)**: The average of the Tenkan-sen and Kijun-sen, plotted 26 periods ahead.
- **Senkou Span B (Leading Span B)**: The average of the highest high and lowest low over the previous 52 periods, plotted 26 periods ahead.
- **Chikou Span (Lagging Span)**: The closing price plotted 26 periods behind.

### 9. Market Profile

Market profile is a charting technique that displays the volume traded at various price levels over a specified time period. It provides a graphical representation of where the most trading activity occurs, indicating significant [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels.

### 10. Sentiment Analysis

[Sentiment analysis](../s/sentiment_analysis.md) involves gauging the overall mood of market participants to predict potential price movements. Advanced sentiment tools include:

- **Commitment of Traders (COT) Report**: Published by the [Commodity Futures](../c/commodity_futures.md) Trading Commission (CFTC), the COT Report provides insights into the positions of different market participants, such as commercial traders, non-commercial traders, and small traders.
- **Social Media Analysis**: Analyzing [social media sentiment](../s/social_media_sentiment.md), such as tweets, forum posts, and news articles, can provide real-time insights into market sentiment and potential price moves.

### 11. Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

Machine learning and AI are increasingly being integrated into advanced [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) to improve the accuracy and efficacy of [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). Techniques such as neural networks, support vector machines, and natural language processing enable traders to analyze vast amounts of data, uncover hidden patterns, and make more informed decisions.

### 12. Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), or algo-trading, involves using computer algorithms to execute trades based on predefined criteria. Advanced [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) tools and indicators are often integrated into these algorithms to enhance their precision and profitability. Companies specializing in this field include:

- **QuantConnect**: [quantconnect.com](https://www.quantconnect.com/)
- **AlgoTrader**: [algotrader.com](https://www.algotrader.com/)

# Arbitrage with Convertible Bonds

**Convertible Bonds Overview:**

A convertible bond is a type of hybrid financial instrument that combines the features of both debt and equity. It allows the bondholder to convert the bond into a predetermined number of shares of the issuing company, usually at the discretion of the bondholder. This hybrid nature allows investors to benefit from the stability and predictable income of a bond while also participating in the potential upside of the company’s stock. A convertible bond typically pays periodic interest until maturity unless it is converted into stock.

The core mechanism of convertible bonds revolves around the conversion price and conversion ratio:
- *Conversion Price:* The price at which the bond can be converted into shares.
- *Conversion Ratio:* The number of shares received upon conversion, calculated as the face value of the bond divided by the conversion price.

**[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) in Convertible Bonds:**

Convertible bond [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) involves exploiting price inefficiencies between convertible bonds and their underlying stocks or other related instruments. Traders typically aim to profit from discrepancies in the pricing of the convertible bond relative to its theoretical value derived from its components (e.g., bond value, stock value, and conversion rights).

**Types of [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) Strategies:**

1. **Convertible [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md):**
   - This strategy involves buying convertible bonds and shorting the underlying stock. The investor profits if the convertible bond is undervalued relative to the stock.
   - Traders monitor the conversion premium, which is the difference between the bond’s conversion value and its market price, to make decisions.

2. **Credit [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md):**
   - Focuses on the credit spread between the convertible bond and other debt instruments issued by the same company. Profit is derived from discrepancies in perceived credit risk.
   - Investors may purchase the convertible bond and sell the company's regular bonds.

3. **Volatility [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md):**
   - Involves taking advantage of differences between the implied volatility of the convertible bond and the actual volatility of the underlying stock.
   - This strategy often entails delta-hedging, where traders adjust their positions in the underlying stock to maintain a neutral delta position in the convertible bond.

4. **Interest Rate [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md):**
   - Exploits differences in interest rate environments. Investors may profit from changes in interest rates that affect the bond's value.
   - Bonds are sensitive to interest rate changes, and traders can hedge interest rate risk through various instruments like Treasury securities or [interest rate swaps](../i/interest_rate_swaps.md).

**Risks in Convertible Bond [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md):**

1. **Market Risk:**
   - The primary risk arises from market movements in the underlying stock. Significant price changes in the stock can impact the value of the convertible bond and the [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategy.
   
2. **Credit Risk:**
   - Related to the issuer's creditworthiness, the risk that the company may default on its obligations impacts the bond’s price.
   
3. **[Liquidity Risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md):**
   - Convertible bonds may be less liquid than stocks, leading to difficulties in entering and exiting positions without significant price impacts.
   
4. **Interest Rate Risk:**
   - Changes in interest rates can affect the bond's price independently of the underlying stock's performance.
   
5. **Borrowing Risk:**
   - When shorting the stock, investors face risks associated with borrowing the stock, such as recall risk (being forced to return the borrowed shares) and costs related to maintaining the short position.

**Popular Tools and Models for [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md):**

1. **[Black-Scholes Model](../b/black-scholes_model.md):**
   - Used to price options and by extension, the option-like component of convertible bonds.

2. **Binomial Tree Model:**
   - Suitable for valuing convertible bonds with complex features like call or [put options](../p/put_options.md), as it models different possible paths the stock price might take and their corresponding bond values.

3. **Monte Carlo Simulations:**
   - Used to value convertible bonds by simulating numerous potential future price paths for the stock and calculating the present value of the bond for each path.

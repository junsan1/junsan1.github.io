# A-B Trust

An A-B [trust](../t/trust.md), also known as a bypass [trust](../t/trust.md) or [credit](../c/credit.md) shelter [trust](../t/trust.md), is a type of [irrevocable trust](../i/irrevocable_trust.md) used for [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md) purposes. The main goal of an A-B [trust](../t/trust.md) is to minimize [estate](../e/estate.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) by maximizing the use of the federal [estate tax](../e/estate_tax.md) [exemption](../e/exemption.md). This type of [trust](../t/trust.md) comes into play upon the death of the first spouse in a married couple, and it is structured in a way that splits the [estate](../e/estate.md) into two separate trusts, [Trust](../t/trust.md) A and [Trust](../t/trust.md) B.

## Purpose and Strategy

The primary purpose of an A-B [trust](../t/trust.md) is to take full advantage of the [exemption](../e/exemption.md) from the federal [estate tax](../e/estate_tax.md) that is statutorily allowed to each individual. When a spouse passes away, the [estate](../e/estate.md) is divided into two separate trusts:

- **[Trust](../t/trust.md) A (Survivor's [Trust](../t/trust.md))**: This is for the benefit of the surviving spouse and includes the surviving spouse’s share of the couple’s property.
- **[Trust](../t/trust.md) B (Bypass [Trust](../t/trust.md), [Credit](../c/credit.md) Shelter [Trust](../t/trust.md), or Decedent’s [Trust](../t/trust.md))**: This [trust](../t/trust.md) is funded with assets equivalent to the [estate tax](../e/estate_tax.md) [exemption](../e/exemption.md) amount available at the time of the first spouse’s death.

The assets placed in [Trust](../t/trust.md) B are not considered part of the surviving spouse’s [estate](../e/estate.md) when they pass away, thereby reducing the taxable [estate](../e/estate.md) and potentially saving considerable sums in [estate](../e/estate.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md).

## Creation and Operation

### Establishment of the Trust

An A-B [trust](../t/trust.md) is established through the creation of a revocable [living trust](../l/living_trust.md) during the couple’s lifetime. The couple, often acting as co-trustees, can manage and control the assets within the [trust](../t/trust.md) while both are alive. Upon the death of the first spouse, the [trust](../t/trust.md) is divided into two sub-trusts, A and B.

### Funding the Trusts

Upon the first death, the [estate](../e/estate.md) assets are allocated to [Trust](../t/trust.md) B up to the excludable amount for [estate](../e/estate.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md), which leverages the [estate tax](../e/estate_tax.md) [exemption](../e/exemption.md) of the deceased spouse. Any remaining assets are allocated to [Trust](../t/trust.md) A, which remains under the control of the surviving spouse.

[Trust](../t/trust.md) A operates as a [revocable trust](../r/revocable_trust.md), meaning the surviving spouse has the flexibility to alter or revoke it. [Trust](../t/trust.md) B, however, becomes irrevocable upon the establishment and is managed according to the terms set out by the deceased spouse, often to benefit the surviving spouse and children.

### Management and Distributions

The surviving spouse typically receives [income](../i/income.md) generated from both trusts and may have limited access to the [principal](../p/principal.md) of [Trust](../t/trust.md) B based on certain criteria, such as health, education, maintenance, or support. This ensures that the surviving spouse is financially supported while preserving the [principal](../p/principal.md) of [Trust](../t/trust.md) B for eventual [distribution](../d/distribution.md) to the beneficiaries, usually the children, upon the death of the surviving spouse.

## Tax Implications

A-B trusts are particularly valuable in states within the United States that do not allow for portability of the [estate tax](../e/estate_tax.md) [exemption](../e/exemption.md) between spouses. By funding [Trust](../t/trust.md) B up to the [exemption](../e/exemption.md) limit, the [estate](../e/estate.md) capitalizes on the maximally available [exemption](../e/exemption.md), thus reducing the tax burden on the surviving spouse’s [estate](../e/estate.md). The assets within [Trust](../t/trust.md) B [will](../w/will.md) not be subject to [estate](../e/estate.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) when the second spouse dies.

Moreover, any appreciation of the assets in [Trust](../t/trust.md) B is not included in the surviving spouse’s taxable [estate](../e/estate.md), providing a further tax advantage. This makes A-B trusts highly effective in preserving [wealth](../w/wealth.md) across generations.

## Benefits of A-B Trusts

1. **Tax [Efficiency](../e/efficiency.md)**: By utilizing both spouses’ [estate tax](../e/estate_tax.md) exemptions, A-B trusts can significantly reduce the [estate](../e/estate.md) [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md) for the beneficiaries.
2. **[Asset Protection](../a/asset_protection.md)**: These trusts protect the deceased spouse’s assets from creditors and potential claims against the surviving spouse.
3. **Control**: The deceased spouse can dictate the terms of [Trust](../t/trust.md) B, ensuring that the assets are distributed according to their wishes, rather than solely at the discretion of the surviving spouse.
4. **[Income](../i/income.md) [Provision](../p/provision.md)**: The [trust](../t/trust.md) ensures that the surviving spouse retains [income](../i/income.md) and, if needed, limited [principal](../p/principal.md) distributions for support and maintenance.

## Drawbacks and Considerations

1. **Complexity**: Establishing and maintaining A-B trusts require careful planning and administration, often necessitating professional assistance, which may be costly.
2. **Irrevocability of [Trust](../t/trust.md) B**: Once [Trust](../t/trust.md) B is funded, it generally cannot be altered, potentially inflexible in addressing changes in circumstances or laws.
3. **Potential Higher Administrative Costs**: Ongoing administrative costs for managing two separate trusts may be higher compared to a simpler [estate](../e/estate.md) plan.
4. **Impact on [Step-Up in Basis](../s/step-up_in_basis.md)**: Assets in [Trust](../t/trust.md) B do not receive a [step-up in basis](../s/step-up_in_basis.md) at the second spouse’s death, which may lead to higher [capital](../c/capital.md) gains [taxes](../t/taxes.md) for beneficiaries.

## Example of A-B Trust in Action

Imagine a couple, John and Jane, with a combined [estate](../e/estate.md) worth $10 million. The federal [estate tax](../e/estate_tax.md) [exemption](../e/exemption.md) is $12.92 million (2023). Upon John’s death, his half of the [estate](../e/estate.md), $5 million, is allocated to [Trust](../t/trust.md) B. This uses John’s [estate tax](../e/estate_tax.md) [exemption](../e/exemption.md). Jane’s half remains in [Trust](../t/trust.md) A.

When Jane dies, her [estate](../e/estate.md) (now potentially appreciated to a greater [value](../v/value.md) if assets appreciated over time) includes only her $5 million plus any growth minus distributions, thereby potentially staying within the [exemption](../e/exemption.md) limit and avoiding further [estate](../e/estate.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md).

## Situations for Using A-B Trusts

A-B trusts are particularly suitable for high-net-worth individuals or couples in states without [estate tax](../e/estate_tax.md) [exemption](../e/exemption.md) portability. They are also beneficial for those desiring strict control over the [disposition](../d/disposition.md) of their assets posthumously and wish to provide for their surviving spouse while minimizing tax liabilities.

## Summary

A-B trusts are a sophisticated yet valuable tool in [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md), particularly for reducing [estate tax](../e/estate_tax.md) liabilities and providing controlled financial [security](../s/security.md) for a surviving spouse. Despite some complexities and potential costs, the benefits often outweigh the drawbacks, making them a popular choice among wealthier individuals and families.

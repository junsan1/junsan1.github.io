# Additional Child Tax Credit

The Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) is a refundable tax credit in the United States designed to assist lower-income families who have qualifying children. This credit aims to provide financial relief and support to those who may not have enough income to take full advantage of the nonrefundable Child Tax Credit. The refundable nature of the ACTC allows taxpayers to receive a refund even if they owe no federal income tax. This guide will explore the intricacies of the ACTC, including eligibility criteria, calculation methods, legislative history, and its impact on families.

## Eligibility Criteria

### Qualifying Child

To be eligible for the ACTC, the child must meet the following requirements:
- **Age Requirement:** The child must be under 17 years of age at the end of the tax year.
- **Relationship Requirement:** The child must be a son, daughter, stepchild, foster child, sibling, stepsibling, or a descendant of any of these.
- **Citizenship Requirement:** The child must be a U.S. citizen, U.S. national, or U.S. resident alien.
- **Residency Requirement:** The child must have lived with the taxpayer for more than half of the tax year.
- **Support Requirement:** The child must not have provided more than half of their own support during the tax year.

### Income Requirements

The ACTC is aimed at low- to moderate-income families. Specific income-related criteria include:
- **Earned Income Threshold:** For 2022, taxpayers must have earned income of more than $2,500 to qualify. 
- **Phase-out Limits:** The credit begins to phase out for taxpayers with a higher income, specifically $200,000 for single filers and $400,000 for married couples filing jointly.

### Filing Status

Taxpayers must file under one of the following statuses to be eligible for the ACTC:
- Single
- Married Filing Jointly
- Head of Household
- Qualifying Widow(er)

## Calculation of ACTC

The ACTC is calculated based on the nonrefundable portion of the Child Tax Credit; any remaining amount is then used to determine the ACTC.

### Step-by-Step Calculation

1. **Initial Calculation of the Child Tax Credit (CTC):**
   - Determine the amount of Child Tax Credit the taxpayer is eligible for ($2,000 per qualifying child for the 2022 tax year).
   
2. **Non-Refundable Portion:**
   - Subtract the tax liability from the Child Tax Credit to find the nonrefundable portion.
   
3. **Refundable Portion (ACTC):**
   - Calculate 15% of the taxpayer's earned income over $2,500.
   - The refundable portion cannot exceed $1,400 per qualifying child.

### Example

Consider a single filer with two qualifying children and an earned income of $30,000:

1. Eligible Child Tax Credit: 2 children x $2,000 = $4,000
2. Tax Liability (hypothetical): $1,000
3. Non-refundable portion: $4,000 - $1,000 = $3,000
4. 15% of earned income over $2,500: 15% x ($30,000 - $2,500) = $4,125
5. Since the refundable portion cannot exceed $1,400 per child: 2 children x $1,400 = $2,800
6. Thus, ACTC = $2,800

## Legislative History

### Original Enactment

The Child Tax Credit (CTC) was initially introduced as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. It allowed a $400 credit per qualifying child, which increased to $500 in subsequent years.

### Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001

This act increased the Child Tax Credit to $1,000 per qualifying child and made it partially refundable, setting the stage for the ACTC.

### American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012

Extended the provisions of the CTC and the ACTC, including the $1,000 credit amount and the refundability threshold.

### Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017

This act boosted the Child Tax Credit to $2,000 per qualifying child and made up to $1,400 of the credit refundable as ACTC. It also raised the phase-out threshold to $200,000 for single filers and $400,000 for joint filers.

### American Rescue Plan Act of 2021

Temporarily increased the Child Tax Credit to $3,000 per child ($3,600 for children under six), made the credit fully refundable, and extended eligibility to 17-year-olds for the 2021 tax year. These changes significantly impacted middle- and lower-income families.

## Impact on Families

### Financial Relief

The ACTC offers substantial financial assistance to families who might not otherwise benefit fully from the nonrefundable Child Tax Credit. By providing a refundable credit, the ACTC helps to reduce poverty and supports families in meeting their financial obligations.

### Reducing Childhood Poverty

According to various studies, including those by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) and the Urban Institute, the ACTC has significantly reduced childhood poverty rates. By providing additional funds to families in need, the ACTC contributes to better health, educational outcomes, and overall well-being for children.

### Support for Low-Income Earners

Families with lower incomes often have minimal tax liabilities, rendering them unable to benefit from nonrefundable tax credits. The ACTC ensures these families receive financial support, helping them cover essential expenses such as food, housing, and childcare.

### Economic Stimulus

By distributing funds to low- and moderate-income families, the ACTC contributes to economic stimulus. Recipients are likely to spend the credits on goods and services, thereby injecting money into the local economy and supporting businesses.

## Criticisms and Debates

### Income Threshold

Critics argue that the $2,500 earned income threshold excludes the poorest families who might need the most assistance. Proposals have been made to lower or eliminate this threshold to make the ACTC more inclusive.

### Refundable Amount Cap

Some policymakers and advocacy groups argue that the $1,400 refundable cap per child should be increased to match the full $2,000 Child Tax Credit, thereby providing more financial support to eligible families.

### Complexity

The calculation of the ACTC can be complex and confusing for many taxpayers, particularly those without professional tax preparation assistance. Simplifying the eligibility criteria and calculation methods could improve access and understanding.

### Legislative Changes

The periodic changes in tax laws related to the ACTC can create uncertainty for families planning their finances. Consistency in policy is crucial to ensuring that families can rely on this support.

## Conclusion

The Additional Child Tax Credit plays a vital role in providing financial assistance to low- and moderate-income families in the United States. By offering a refundable credit, the ACTC helps mitigate the financial burdens faced by many families, supports the well-being of children, and stimulates the economy. While there are areas for potential improvement, the ACTC remains a crucial tool in the fight against childhood poverty and financial instability.

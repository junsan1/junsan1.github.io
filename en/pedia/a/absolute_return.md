# Absolute Return

Absolute [return](../r/return.md) is a financial term referring to the [gain](../g/gain.md) or loss that an [asset](../a/asset.md) or portfolio achieves over a given period, expressed in terms of its percentage [return](../r/return.md). Unlike relative [return](../r/return.md), which measures performance relative to a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) or [index](../i/index_instrument.md), absolute [return](../r/return.md) focuses solely on the individual performance of the investment itself.

## Concept and Importance

### Definition and Calculation
Absolute [return](../r/return.md) is calculated as the appreciation (or [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md)) in the [value](../v/value.md) of an investment or portfolio over a certain period. It is typically expressed as a percentage. The formula for calculating absolute [return](../r/return.md) is as follows:

\[ \text{Absolute [Return](../r/return.md)} = \left( \frac{\text{Ending [Value](../v/value.md)} - \text{Beginning [Value](../v/value.md)}}{\text{Beginning [Value](../v/value.md)}} \right) \times 100\% \]

For example, if an [investor](../i/investor.md) starts with $100,000 and the portfolio grows to $120,000 after one year, the absolute [return](../r/return.md) would be:

\[ \text{Absolute [Return](../r/return.md)} = \left( \frac{120,000 - 100,000}{100,000} \right) \times 100\% = 20\% \]

### Importance in Investment Strategy
[Absolute return strategies](../a/absolute_return_strategies.md) are important because they aim to provide positive returns regardless of [market](../m/market.md) conditions. Investors employing such strategies seek to make [money](../m/money.md) in both rising and falling markets, focusing on [capital preservation](../c/capital_preservation.md) and steady growth.

This type of strategy is particularly appealing during periods of [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) or downturns, as it aims to deliver consistent results independent of [market](../m/market.md) trends. Therefore, [absolute return strategies](../a/absolute_return_strategies.md) can be an essential component of a diversified investment portfolio, providing a [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against [market](../m/market.md) risks.

## Absolute Return Funds

### Characteristics
Absolute [return](../r/return.md) funds are investment funds managed with the goal of generating positive returns in any [market](../m/market.md) environment. These funds often use various investment techniques, including long-short positions, [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), and [leverage](../l/leverage.md), to achieve their [return](../r/return.md) objectives.

### Types of Absolute Return Funds
1. **[Hedge](../h/hedge.md) Funds**: These are pooled investment funds that are more flexible than traditional mutual funds. They can use a wide [range](../r/range.md) of strategies to achieve high absolute returns, such as long-short [equity](../e/equity.md), [market neutral](../m/market_neutral.md), event-driven, [global macro](../g/global_macro.md), and more.
2. **Absolute [Return](../r/return.md) Mutual Funds**: These funds aim to generate positive returns similar to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds but are subject to regulations that generally make them less risky and lower returning than [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds.
3. **[Managed Futures](../m/managed_futures.md) Funds**: These invest in [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) and [options on futures](../o/options_on_futures.md), employing strategies like [trend following](../t/trend_following.md) and [systematic trading](../s/systematic_trading.md) to achieve absolute returns.

### Examples of Absolute Return Funds
1. **Bridgewater Associates**: One of the largest [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds in the world, managed by Ray Dalio. [Bridgewater Associates](https://www.bridgewater.com/)
2. **Two Sigma**: A renowned [fund](../f/fund.md) that relies heavily on [quantitative analysis](../q/quantitative_analysis.md) and algorithms. [Two Sigma](https://www.twosigma.com/)
3. **AQR [Capital](../c/capital.md) Management**: Known for its [quantitative investment strategies](../q/quantitative_investment_strategies.md) aimed at absolute [return](../r/return.md). [AQR Capital Management](https://www.aqr.com/)

## Strategies for Achieving Absolute Return

### Long-Short Equity
This strategy involves taking long positions in [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) while shorting [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md). The goal is to [profit](../p/profit.md) from the relative price movements of these securities, regardless of overall [market](../m/market.md) trends.

### Market Neutral
[Market neutral strategies](../m/market_neutral_strategies.md) aim to exploit price inefficiencies between related financial instruments while maintaining a [neutral](../n/neutral.md) exposure to the [market](../m/market.md). This is done by balancing long and short positions to mitigate [market risk](../m/market_risk.md).

### Global Macro
This approach involves taking positions based on macroeconomic trends and geopolitical events. [Fund](../f/fund.md) managers analyze global [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md) and use various instruments, including currencies, commodities, and bonds, to achieve absolute returns.

### Arbitrage
[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategies seek to take advantage of price discrepancies between related instruments across different markets or within the same [market](../m/market.md). Common forms include [merger arbitrage](../m/merger_arbitrage.md), [convertible arbitrage](../c/convertible_arbitrage.md), and statistical [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md).

### Managed Futures
These strategies involve trading [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) based on systematic or discretionary methods. [Managed futures](../m/managed_futures.md) funds often use [trend](../t/trend.md)-following models to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on price movements in various [asset](../a/asset.md) classes, including commodities, currencies, and stock indices.

### Event-Driven
Event-driven strategies [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on opportunities arising from corporate events such as mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, and restructurings. By identifying and [investing](../i/investing.md) in securities affected by these events, [fund](../f/fund.md) managers aim to generate absolute returns.

## Benefits and Risks of Absolute Return Strategies

### Benefits
1. **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: [Absolute return strategies](../a/absolute_return_strategies.md) often have low correlations with traditional [asset](../a/asset.md) classes like [stocks](../s/stock.md) and bonds, adding [diversification](../d/diversification.md) to an investment portfolio.
2. **[Capital Preservation](../c/capital_preservation.md)**: These strategies emphasize protecting [capital](../c/capital.md) and seek to generate positive returns in both [bull](../b/bull.md) and bear markets.
3. **Potential for Higher Returns**: By employing various sophisticated techniques, absolute [return](../r/return.md) funds have the potential to deliver higher returns compared to traditional investment strategies.

### Risks
1. **Complexity**: The strategies employed can be complex and may require a higher level of expertise and [active management](../a/active_management.md).
2. **[Leverage](../l/leverage.md) [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: Many absolute [return](../r/return.md) funds use [leverage](../l/leverage.md), which can amplify both gains and losses.
3. **[Market](../m/market.md) and [Liquidity Risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md)**: Despite aiming for positive returns in all conditions, absolute [return](../r/return.md) funds are not immune to [market](../m/market.md) and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) risks.
4. **Management [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: The success of these funds heavily relies on the skill and experience of the [fund](../f/fund.md) managers. Poor decision-making can lead to significant losses.

## Performance Measurement

### Benchmarking
Unlike traditional funds, which are often benchmarked against indices like the S&P 500, absolute [return](../r/return.md) funds do not have a standard [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) since they aim to deliver positive returns regardless of [market](../m/market.md) conditions. Performance is often assessed based on the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s ability to achieve its target [return](../r/return.md) and manage [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Performance Metrics
1. **[Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md)**: Measures [risk-adjusted return](../r/risk-adjusted_return.md) by calculating the [excess return](../e/excess_return.md) per unit of [risk](../r/risk.md) ([standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md)).
2. **[Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md)**: Similar to the [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) but focuses only on [downside risk](../d/downside_risk.md) by using the [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) of negative returns.
3. **Maximum [Drawdown](../d/drawdown.md)**: The maximum observed loss from a peak to a [trough](../t/trough.md), providing insight into the worst-case scenario for the investment.
4. **[Alpha](../a/alpha.md)**: Represents the [excess return](../e/excess_return.md) of the [fund](../f/fund.md) relative to its [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md), adjusted for [risk](../r/risk.md).

## Conclusion

Absolute [return](../r/return.md) is a compelling strategy for investors seeking to achieve consistent gains regardless of [market](../m/market.md) conditions. By employing diverse and sophisticated techniques, absolute [return](../r/return.md) funds aim to provide positive returns and [capital preservation](../c/capital_preservation.md). However, they come with complexities and risks that require careful consideration and expert management. For those looking to diversify their portfolios and [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md), [absolute return strategies](../a/absolute_return_strategies.md) can [offer](../o/offer.md) valuable benefits.

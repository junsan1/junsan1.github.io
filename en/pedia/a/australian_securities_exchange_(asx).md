# Australian Securities Exchange (ASX)

The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) is Australia's primary securities exchange, located in Sydney, New South Wales. ASX operates markets for a diverse range of asset classes including equities, fixed income, commodities, and more. It acts as a comprehensive platform that serves various stakeholders in the financial industry, such as companies looking to raise capital, investors seeking to buy and sell securities, and various firms engaging in investment and financial services. Algortrading is one such domain deeply interlinked with the functioning of ASX.

## Historical Background

The history of ASX dates back to the 19th century with the establishment of Australia's first stock exchange in Melbourne in 1861. Over the years, six state-based stock exchanges operated independently. The amalgamation of these exchanges in the late 20th century led to the formation of a unified stock market.

The Australian Stock Exchange Limited (ASX) was established in 1987 under the Australian Securities Exchange Act. In 2006, the ASX merged with the Sydney Futures Exchange, further extending its market capabilities. This merger resulted in the present-day Australian Securities Exchange.

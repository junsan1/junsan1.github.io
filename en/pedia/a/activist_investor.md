# Activist Investor

An activist [investor](../i/investor.md) is a [stakeholder](../s/stakeholder.md) who uses [equity](../e/equity.md) ownership in a publicly traded company to push for changes within the company. These changes could be related to the company’s [financial structure](../f/financial_structure.md), [market](../m/market.md) positioning, operational strategy, management practices, or governance policies. Unlike passive investors, who maintain a hands-off approach, activist investors actively seek to influence or bring about changes that they believe [will](../w/will.md) increase [shareholder value](../s/shareholder_value.md).

## Objectives of Activist Investors

### Financial Performance Enhancement
One of the primary objectives is to improve the [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) of the targeted company. Activist investors often push for cost-cutting measures, [restructuring](../r/restructuring.md), or strategic shifts to enhance profitability and unlock [shareholder value](../s/shareholder_value.md).

### Corporate Governance
Activists may advocate for enhanced [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) practices. This could involve pushing for better [transparency](../t/transparency.md), the appointment of independent directors, changes in executive compensation, and improved [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) rights.

### Strategic Redirection
Activists might suggest a strategic redirection, such as divesting non-core assets, entering or exiting certain markets, or changing the company's [capital allocation](../c/capital_allocation.md) strategy. These measures aim to better align the company’s strategy with [market](../m/market.md) opportunities and risks.

### Management Changes
In many cases, activists seek changes in the company’s management team. This could involve removing underperforming executives or board members and installing new [leadership](../l/leadership.md) believed to be more capable of driving the company forward.

## Methods Employed by Activist Investors

### Share Accumulation
Activist investors typically acquire a significant stake in a company to [gain](../g/gain.md) [leverage](../l/leverage.md). Once a sufficient stake is accumulated, they may engage with management or the board to propose their ideas.

### Shareholder Proposals
Activists can submit proposals to be voted on by other shareholders during the company's annual meeting. These proposals might address issues such as governance changes, strategic redirection, or executive compensation.

### Public Campaigns
Some activist investors resort to public campaigns to apply pressure on the company's management and board. They may publish [open](../o/open.md) letters, use media channels, or engage in [proxy](../p/proxy.md) battles to [rally](../r/rally.md) other shareholders.

### Proxy Fights
In cases where negotiations with the company’s management [fail](../f/fail.md), activists may initiate a [proxy fight](../p/proxy_fight.md). This involves persuading other shareholders to vote for their proposed changes or for a new slate of directors that the activist supports.

### Litigation
If necessary, activist investors might resort to legal actions to enforce their rights or push for changes, particularly if they believe the company’s management is engaging in practices detrimental to [shareholder value](../s/shareholder_value.md).

## Case Studies

### Yahoo!

### Valeant Pharmaceuticals
Bill Ackman’s campaign at Valeant Pharmaceuticals was focused on the company’s controversial [business](../b/business.md) practices.

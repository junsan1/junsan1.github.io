# Arbitrage Strategies in Different Markets

[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) is the simultaneous purchase and sale of an asset to profit from a difference in the price across different markets or forms. It exploits short-term discrepancies in the prices of identical or similar financial instruments on different markets or in different forms. These strategies are fundamental in making markets more efficient as they help in achieving price equilibrium by balancing discrepancies through immediate trading actions. 

## Types of Arbitrage

### 1. **Pure Arbitrage**

Pure [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), often referred to as classical [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), involves buying and selling the same asset simultaneously in different markets to profit from price discrepancies. The key here is that the price difference represents a risk-free profit.

**Example:**
If a stock is trading at $100 on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and at $101 on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), a trader could buy the stock on NYSE and simultaneously sell it on LSE, capturing a profit of $1 per share minus transaction costs.

### 2. **Risk Arbitrage**

Risk [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), also known as merger [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), occurs when an investor attempts to profit from the merger or acquisition announcements. Investors typically buy the stock of the company being acquired and short sell the stock of the acquiring company, banking on the spread between the offer price and the current trading price narrowing as the deal closes.

**Example:**
Company A announces plans to acquire Company B for $50 per share, but Company B’s shares are currently trading at $45. An arbitrageur might buy shares of Company B at $45 and profit if the deal goes through and shares eventually trade up to the offer price of $50.

### 3. **Convertible Arbitrage**

Convertible [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) involves taking a long position in a company’s convertible securities, like bonds or preferred shares, and a short position in the company’s common stock. The expectation is that the convertible security and the short stock position will offset one another, allowing small, consistent profits regardless of the market direction.

**Example:**
An investor buys a convertible bond and shorts the underlying stock. If the stock price drops, the short sale profits offset the bond's decreased value, and if the stock price rises, the convertible feature allows for profitable conversion.

### 4. **Fixed-Income Arbitrage**

Fixed-income [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategies involve the simultaneous purchase and sale of different bonds to exploit price differences. This can include trading between bonds of different maturities, ratings, or from different issuers.

**Example:**
A trader notices that 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds are undervalued relative to 5-year U.S. Treasury bonds. They might buy the 10-year bonds and short the 5-year bonds, profiting as the spread between them adjusts.

### 5. **Statistical Arbitrage**

Statistical [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) involves using complex mathematical models to identify temporary price discrepancies among a set or 'basket' of securities. Traders use algorithms to predict price movements based on historical relationships, and profits are made on the convergence of the securities' prices.

**Example:**
A statistical [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) model might identify that stock A and stock B typically have a price correlation. If this correlation temporarily diverges, the trader may short the over-performing stock and go long the under-performing stock to profit from the reversion to the mean.

### 6. **Triangular Arbitrage**

Triangular [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) typically occurs in the foreign exchange market, involving three currencies. Traders exploit discrepancies between three related currency pairs, converting one currency to another, then to a third, and back to the first, ideally ending up with a profit after the round-trip conversion.

**Example:**
If USD/EUR, EUR/GBP, and GBP/USD quotes presented an inconsistency, a trader could exchange USD for EUR, then EUR for GBP, and finally GBP back to USD, ultimately ending with more USD than initially held due to the exploited rate differences.

### 7. **Cross-Border Arbitrage**

Cross-border [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategies involve taking advantage of the price differences of securities that trade on multiple international exchanges. The trader buys the asset in the market where it is undervalued and sells it in the market where it is overvalued.

**Example:**
A stock traded on both the Tokyo and New York exchanges might be priced differently due to exchange rates, market inefficiencies, or other factors. An arbitrageur might buy the stock in Tokyo where it is cheaper and sell it in New York where it is more expensive.

## Arbitrage in Different Markets

### **Equity Markets**

Equity [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) involves exploiting price discrepancies of stocks on different exchanges or derivative markets. This can include index [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), [pairs trading](../p/pairs_trading.md), and sector-based strategies.

**Example:**
Index [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) takes advantage of discrepancies between [index futures](../i/index_futures.md) and the underlying stocks in the index. If the future is overpriced relative to the index value, arbitragers may sell the future and buy the underlying stocks and vice versa.

### **Commodity Markets**

Commodity [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) deals with price differences in commodities across different markets or forms. Traders make profits from misalignments in the prices of related commodity contracts or between spot markets and futures.

**Example:**
A trader might notice that gold is priced differently in the futures market compared to the spot market. By buying gold in the cheaper market and simultaneously selling it in the higher-priced market, they can lock in a profit.

### **Foreign Exchange Markets**

In forex markets, [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) trading involves exploiting minor price discrepancies among different currency pairs or among currency exchanges. 

**Example:**
Currency [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) could include taking advantage of different exchange rates offered by banks or forex brokers for the same currency pairs. Using triangular [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), traders can profit from minute differences in exchange rates.

### **Credit Markets**

[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) in credit markets involves exploiting pricing inefficiencies between different credit instruments or between credit instruments and their [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md).

**Example:**
In the case of bond and credit default swap (CDS) [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), the arbitrageur takes opposite positions in the bond and its corresponding CDS to lock in the price discrepancy and profit from the difference in credit risk pricing.

### **Cryptocurrency Markets**

The relatively new and less efficient cryptocurrency markets offer unique [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) opportunities due to significant price differences across various exchanges.

**Example:**
A bitcoin arbitrageur might notice price differences for Bitcoin on Binance and Coinbase. By buying Bitcoin at a lower price on one exchange and selling it at a higher price on the other, they can capture a risk-free profit after accounting for trading fees.

### **Derivative Markets**

[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) opportunities in the derivative markets involve exploiting price differences between [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) and their underlying assets. These could exist in options, futures, or other derivative products.

**Example:**
Options [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), like the "conversion" or "reversal" strategy, involves a combination of buying and selling the underlying stock and various options to lock in a risk-free profit when the pricing between the stock and options is misaligned.

# Alternative Trading System (ATS)

An Alternative Trading System (ATS) is a non-[exchange](../e/exchange.md) trading venue that matches buyers and sellers to find counterparties for transactions. These systems facilitate trading in a variety of assets, including [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, and [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), but they do so outside of traditional public stock exchanges. ATSs often operate under various regulations as well as certain restrictions, yet they [offer](../o/offer.md) benefits like reduced costs and faster [trade](../t/trade.md) [execution](../e/execution.md). This document provides a comprehensive overview of ATS, its types, functioning, advantages, regulations, and notable examples.

## Types of ATS

### Electronic Communication Networks (ECNs)

ECNs are computerized systems that automatically match buy and sell orders for securities in the [market](../m/market.md). These networks allow traders to bypass brokers and interact directly with the [market](../m/market.md), thus reducing [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md). Notable examples include:

- #### [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md)
  [NASDAQ](https://www.nasdaq.com/) operates [multiple](../m/multiple.md) ECNs that facilitate trading in securities.

### Dark Pools

[Dark pools](../d/dark_pools.md) are private financial forums or exchanges for trading securities. Unlike public exchanges, the orders placed in [dark pools](../d/dark_pools.md) are not visible to the public, hence the term "dark." These systems are typically used by larger institutional investors to execute large trades without affecting the [market price](../m/market_price.md). Notable examples include:

- #### Liquidnet
  [Liquidnet](https://www.liquidnet.com/) is a global institutional trading network, [offering](../o/offering.md) services in [dark pool](../d/dark_pool.md) trading.

### Crossing Networks

Crossing networks are a type of ATS that matches buy and sell orders electronically without routing the [order](../o/order.md) to a public [exchange](../e/exchange.md). These networks often execute orders at predetermined times and prices. Notable examples include:

- #### ITG POSIT
  [ITG POSIT](https://www.itg.com/products-technology/trading-networks/posit/) is one such crossing network that provides anonymous, automated trading solutions.

## How ATS Works

An ATS functions as an intermediary between a buyer and a seller, [matching orders](../m/matching_orders.md) without the need to go through traditional exchanges. Below are the basic steps involved:

1. **[Order](../o/order.md) Placement**: Orders are placed by investors through their brokers or directly if they have access.
2. **[Order](../o/order.md) Matching**: The ATS's system matches these orders based on their pricing and [volume](../v/volume.md).
3. **[Trade](../t/trade.md) [Execution](../e/execution.md)**: Once a match is found, the [trade](../t/trade.md) is executed electronically.
4. **Settlement**: The [trade](../t/trade.md) is then settled, meaning the securities are transferred from the seller to the buyer and the cash is transferred in the opposite direction.

### Order Types

Different types of orders can be placed in an ATS. These include:

- **[Market](../m/market.md) Orders**: Orders to buy or sell immediately at the current [market price](../m/market_price.md).
- **Limit Orders**: Orders to buy or sell at a specific price or better.
- **Stop Orders**: Orders that become [market](../m/market.md) orders once a specified price is reached.

### Technology Stack

The technology stack of an ATS generally includes:

- **Matching Engine**: The core component responsible for matching buy and sell orders.
- **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md) System**: Ensures that trades comply with regulatory standards and [risk profiles](../r/risk_profiles.md).
- **Network [Infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md)**: High-speed, low-latency networks to facilitate rapid [trade](../t/trade.md) [execution](../e/execution.md).
- **[Security](../s/security.md) Measures**: Cybersecurity protocols to protect the integrity of the trading system.

## Advantages of ATS

### Lower Costs

ATS often provides lower [transaction fees](../t/transaction_fees.md) compared to traditional exchanges. This cost [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) is primarily due to reduced intermediaries and lower overhead costs.

### Anonymity

[Dark pools](../d/dark_pools.md) and some other types of ATS [offer](../o/offer.md) anonymity, which can be particularly beneficial for large institutional trades. This anonymity can reduce [market](../m/market.md) impact and information [leakage](../l/leakage.md).

### Flexibility

ATS allows for various [order types](../o/order_types_in_trading.md) and [execution](../e/execution.md) strategies, [offering](../o/offering.md) more flexibility to traders. This is especially useful for [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) where specific conditions need to be met.

### Speed

With advanced technological [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md), ATS provides faster [trade](../t/trade.md) executions. This speed is crucial for high-frequency trading (HFT) and other strategy-based trading.

## Regulatory Framework

### United States

In the U.S., ATSs are regulated by the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) under Regulation ATS. They are usually required to register as [broker](../b/broker.md)-dealers and comply with specific standards related to [transparency](../t/transparency.md), [fraud](../f/fraud.md) prevention, and trading practices.

- #### Finra
  [Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)](https://www.finra.org/) oversees the quality and fairness of ATS operations in the U.S.

### Europe

In Europe, ATSs are governed under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive ([MiFID II](../m/mifid_ii.md)), which sets out rules to increase [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and protect investors.

- #### ESMA
  [European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA)](https://www.esma.europa.eu/) regulates [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) in the [European Union](../e/european_union_(eu).md), including ATS.

### Asia

Different Asian countries have their own regulatory bodies overseeing ATS operations. For example, Japan has the Financial Services Agency (FSA), while Hong Kong has the Securities and [Futures](../f/futures.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SFC).

- #### FSA Japan
  [Financial Services Agency (FSA)](https://www.fsa.go.jp/en/) is Japanâ€™s regulatory authority overseeing ATS.

## Conclusion

Alternative [Trading Systems](../t/trading_systems.md) (ATS) represent a vital component of today's [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). They [offer](../o/offer.md) numerous advantages in terms of cost, speed, and flexibility while posing unique regulatory challenges. As technology continues to evolve, the role and influence of ATS in the financial ecosystem are likely to expand further.

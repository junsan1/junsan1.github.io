# Allotment

## Introduction
Allotment, in the context of [finance](../f/finance.md) and stock markets, refers to the process by which securities (such as [stocks](../s/stock.md) or bonds) are distributed to investors. It typically occurs during events like Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), Further Public Offerings (FPOs), or other issues of [shares](../s/shares.md). The allotment stage follows the subscription phase where investors apply for [shares](../s/shares.md). The allocation can be based on various criteria such as the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) applied by each [investor](../i/investor.md), pro-rata [basis](../b/basis.md), or preferential allotment.

## Initial Public Offerings (IPOs)
An Initial Public [Offering](../o/offering.md) (IPO) represents the first time that a company offers its [shares](../s/shares.md) to the public. During an IPO, an allotment is decided based on the [demand](../d/demand.md) and [supply](../s/supply.md) of [shares](../s/shares.md). The primary goal is to ensure a fair [distribution](../d/distribution.md) and to help [price discovery](../p/price_discovery.md) in the [market](../m/market.md).

### Steps in IPO Allotment
1. **Application Submission**: Investors submit applications to subscribe to the IPO [shares](../s/shares.md).
2. **Subscription Analysis**: The total [demand](../d/demand.md) for [shares](../s/shares.md) is analyzed.
3. **Allocation Criteria**: [Shares](../s/shares.md) are allocated based on predefined criteria.
4. **Announcement**: The final allotment is announced, and [shares](../s/shares.md) are transferred to the investors' Demat accounts.

## Reasons for Raising Shares
Companies opt to raise [shares](../s/shares.md) for myriad reasons, ranging from [expansion](../e/expansion.md) plans to [restructuring](../r/restructuring.md) debts. The reasons can be broadly categorized into the following:

### Funding Expansion Plans
Companies looking to expand their operations, enter new markets, or invest in new projects often require substantial [capital](../c/capital.md). Raising [shares](../s/shares.md) is one way to generate the necessary funds without increasing the company’s [debt](../d/debt.md) burden.

### Reducing Debt
Firms burdened with significant [debt](../d/debt.md) might raise [shares](../s/shares.md) to pay off loans. Issuing [shares](../s/shares.md) can provide the necessary [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) to manage and reduce overall [debt](../d/debt.md), thereby improving the company’s [financial health](../f/financial_health.md).

### Enhancing Liquidity
A company might [issue](../i/issue.md) more [shares](../s/shares.md) to increase the [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) of its stock. Greater share availability can improve [market](../m/market.md) perception and attract a broader [investor](../i/investor.md) base. Enhanced [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) can result in more stable stock prices.

### Strategic Acquisitions
Raising [shares](../s/shares.md) can help a company [finance](../f/finance.md) mergers or acquisitions. The [capital](../c/capital.md) raised can be used to execute strategic acquisitions that align with the company's long-term goals and growth plans.

### Strengthening Balance Sheet
Raising [shares](../s/shares.md) increases the [equity](../e/equity.md) base of the company, thus strengthening its [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md). This can help in improving [financial ratios](../f/financial_ratios.md), which can be favorable for future borrowings and investment opportunities.

## Methods of Allotment
Different methods can be employed to allocate [shares](../s/shares.md) during an IPO or any other issuance of [shares](../s/shares.md). Each method has its implications and is suitable for different scenarios.

### Pro-rata Basis
When the [issue](../i/issue.md) is [oversubscribed](../o/oversubscribed.md), [shares](../s/shares.md) may be allotted on a pro-rata [basis](../b/basis.md). This means that each applicant receives [shares](../s/shares.md) in proportion to the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) applied for. For example, if an [investor](../i/investor.md) applies for 1000 [shares](../s/shares.md) and the subscription is twice the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) available, the [investor](../i/investor.md) might only receive 500 [shares](../s/shares.md).

### Lottery System
Particularly relevant for retail portions in heavily [oversubscribed](../o/oversubscribed.md) IPOs, the lottery system is a random selection process ensuring each applicant has an equal chance to receive [shares](../s/shares.md).

### Preferential Allotment
In this method, [shares](../s/shares.md) are allotted to specific investors based on pre-agreed terms. This is often seen in private placements where securities are sold to a select group of investors.

### Book Building Process
Here, investors [bid](../b/bid.md) for the [shares](../s/shares.md) within a specified price [range](../r/range.md), and based on the bids, the final [issue](../i/issue.md) price and allotment are determined. This method helps in efficient [price discovery](../p/price_discovery.md).

## Detailed Example: XYZ Tech IPO
To understand the allotment process better, consider the hypothetical example of XYZ Tech, a tech [startup](../s/startup.md) [going public](../g/going_public.md):

1. **[Pre-IPO](../p/pre-ipo.md) Stage**: XYZ Tech decides to go public and files for an IPO with a total [offering](../o/offering.md) of 1 million [shares](../s/shares.md).
2. **[Investor](../i/investor.md) Applications**: The IPO opens, and investors apply for 3 million [shares](../s/shares.md) in total, making it 3 times [oversubscribed](../o/oversubscribed.md).
3. **Allotment Process**:
   - Retail investors' portion is [oversubscribed](../o/oversubscribed.md) and allotted through a lottery system.
   - Institutional investors receive a pro-rata allocation.
4. **Final Allocation**: XYZ Tech announces the allocation result:
   - Retail investors who applied through lottery get a proportional share.
   - Institutional bidders like [investment banks](../i/investment_bank_(ib).md) and mutual funds receive [shares](../s/shares.md) based on their [bid](../b/bid.md) strength.

XYZ Tech successfully raises [capital](../c/capital.md) while ensuring fair and transparent allotment to various [investor](../i/investor.md) categories.

## Prominent Companies and Their IPOs
A few companies that have recently gone public and followed the above allotment process include:

### [Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB)](https://www.airbnb.com/)
Airbnb, the vacation rental giant, went public on December 10, 2020. The IPO was a milestone, [offering](../o/offering.md) 51.55 million [shares](../s/shares.md), and it was [oversubscribed](../o/oversubscribed.md) [multiple](../m/multiple.md) times.

### [Snowflake Inc. (NYSE: SNOW)](https://www.snowflake.com/)
Snowflake, a cloud-based data warehouse company, had one of the most anticipated IPOs in 2020, raising around $3.4 billion by issuing 28 million [shares](../s/shares.md).

### [DoorDash, Inc. (NYSE: DASH)](https://www.doordash.com/)
DoorDash, the food delivery service, raised around $3.37 billion by [offering](../o/offering.md) 33 million [shares](../s/shares.md) in its December 2020 IPO.

## Conclusion
Allotment is an integral part of the [equity](../e/equity.md) issuance process, ensuring a fair [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of [shares](../s/shares.md) to investors. Whether via an IPO, FPO, rights [issue](../i/issue.md), or any other issuance method, companies utilize share allotment to raise necessary [capital](../c/capital.md) to [fund](../f/fund.md) growth, reduce [debt](../d/debt.md), and achieve strategic objectives. The process involves several steps and criteria to ensure [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and equitable access for investors.

# Adaptive Moving Average

The Adaptive Moving Average (AMA), also known as the Kaufman Adaptive Moving Average (KAMA), is a [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) tool that was developed by American quantitative financial theorist Perry J. Kaufman in 1995. It is designed to account for varying [market](../m/market.md) conditions and to adapt dynamically to price movements by smoothing out [noise](../n/noise.md) and reducing lag. Unlike traditional moving averages such as the Simple Moving Average (SMA) or Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which have fixed periods, the Adaptive Moving Average adjusts its sensitivity based on [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and price trends.

## Key Concepts

### Efficiency Ratio (ER)

One of the cornerstone elements of AMA is the [Efficiency Ratio](../e/efficiency_ratio.md) (ER), which quantifies the relative [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) of price movement in a given period and helps in adapting the smoothing [factor](../f/factor.md). The [Efficiency Ratio](../e/efficiency_ratio.md) is calculated using the formula:

\[ ER = \frac{\text{Change}}{\text{[Volatility](../v/volatility.md)}} \]

Where:
- **Change** is the absolute [value](../v/value.md) of the difference between the current price and the price n periods ago.
- **[Volatility](../v/volatility.md)** is the sum of the absolute values of the price changes over each period.

The ER ranges from 0 to 1:
- A high ER (near 1) indicates strong trending conditions where prices are consistently moving in one direction.
- A low ER (near 0) indicates choppy or sideways [market](../m/market.md) conditions with less directional movement.

### Smoothing Constant (SC)

In [order](../o/order.md) to adjust the AMA, the ER is used to modify the Smoothing Constant (SC), which essentially determines the rate at which the moving average responds to price changes. The formula for SC is:

\[ SC_{t} = [ER \times (FastestPeriod - SlowestPeriod) + SlowestPeriod]^2 \]

Typically, the fastest and slowest periods are set to values such as 2 and 30, respectively, but these can be adjusted according to the [trader](../t/trader.md)’s preferences.

### AMA Calculation

Once the ER and SC are determined, the final step is to calculate the Adaptive Moving Average itself, using the formula:

\[ AMA_{t} = AMA_{t-1} + SC_{t} \times (Price_{t} - AMA_{t-1}) \]

Where:
- **AMA\(_{t}\)** is the Adaptive Moving Average at time \( t \)
- **AMA\(_{t-1}\)** is the Adaptive Moving Average at time \( t-1 \)
- **Price\(_{t}\)** is the [asset](../a/asset.md)’s price at time \( t \)
- **SC\(_{t}\)** is the Smoothing Constant at time \( t \)

## Advantages of AMA

### Noise Reduction

One of the primary advantages of AMA is its ability to filter out [market](../m/market.md) [noise](../n/noise.md). During periods of low [volatility](../v/volatility.md) or no clear [trend](../t/trend.md), the AMA remains relatively flat, thus reducing the number of [false signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md) and trading whipsaws.

### Reduced Lag

Because the AMA adapts based on [market](../m/market.md) conditions, it tends to respond more quickly during strong trends and more slowly during sideways markets. This adaptiveness reduces the lag inherent in traditional moving averages, aligning more closely with current [price action](../p/price_action.md) when the [market](../m/market.md) is trending.

### Versatility

The Adaptive Moving Average is versatile and can be applied to various types of financial instruments such as [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, commodities, and forex. It is equally effective in detecting both long-term and short-term trends.

## Limitations

Despite its advantages, the AMA has its own set of limitations. The primary drawback is its complexity compared to traditional moving averages. This complexity requires a deeper understanding and careful tuning of parameters like the [Efficiency Ratio](../e/efficiency_ratio.md) and the Smoothing Constant, which may not be accessible to all traders, especially novices.

## Implementation

### Python Example

Here is a basic implementation of the Adaptive Moving Average in Python:

```python
[import](../i/import.md) numpy as np

def AMA(prices, period_fast=2, period_slow=30):
    n = len(prices)
    ama = np.zeros(n)
    change = np.abs(prices - np.roll(prices, period_fast))
    [volatility](../v/volatility.md) = np.sum(np.abs(prices - np.roll(prices, 1)))
    er = change / [volatility](../v/volatility.md)

    sc = (er * (2 / (period_fast + 1) - 2 / (period_slow + 1)) + 2 / (period_slow + 1)) ** 2
    ama[0] = prices[0]

    for i in [range](../r/range.md)(1, n):
        ama[i] = ama[i - 1] + sc[i] * (prices[i] - ama[i - 1])

    [return](../r/return.md) ama

prices = np.array([1, 2, 2.5, 2, 1.5, 2.2, 2.8, 3.0, 3.2, 3.6, 3.9, 3.7, 3.8])
ama_values = AMA(prices)

print(ama_values)
```

### Software and Tools

Several financial [software platforms](../s/software_platforms_for_trading.md) and trading tools support the implementation of AMA. Examples include:

- **MetaTrader 4/5**: A popular platform among forex traders, which allows custom indicators like AMA.
- **[NinjaTrader](../n/ninjatrader.md)**: A [trading platform](../t/trading_platform.md) that supports advanced charting and custom indicators.
- **[TradingView](../t/tradingview.md)**: An online charting platform that has a wide [range](../r/range.md) of [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) including custom scripts for AMA.

## Real-World Applications

### Trend Following Systems

The AMA is extensively used in [trend](../t/trend.md)-following systems. Traders use it to identify the beginning and end of trends, applying strategies such as buying when the AMA turns upward in anticipation of a bullish [trend](../t/trend.md) and selling when it turns downward.

### Automated Trading Systems

Given its adaptive nature, the AMA is highly suitable for [automated trading systems](../a/automated_trading_systems.md). Quantitative traders and [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) firms often incorporate it into their [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md). Companies like **[AlgoTrader](../a/algotrader.md)** ([algotrader.com](https://www.algotrader.com)) provide platforms that enable the [incorporation](../i/incorporation.md) of the AMA into automated [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

### Portfolio Management

Portfolio managers use the AMA to manage [risk](../r/risk.md) and enhance returns by dynamically adjusting their positions based on the prevailing [market](../m/market.md) trends. This approach is particularly beneficial in volatile markets where sudden price movements can significantly impact [portfolio performance](../p/portfolio_performance.md).

### Scalping and Intraday Trading

Intraday traders and scalpers benefit from the AMA by using it to identify short-term trends and quick [market](../m/market.md) reversals. The reduced lag helps traders capture opportunities that may not be evident with traditional moving averages.

## Conclusion

The Adaptive Moving Average (AMA) stands out as a powerful tool in the realm of [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) due to its ability to adapt to varying [market](../m/market.md) conditions. By incorporating the [Efficiency Ratio](../e/efficiency_ratio.md) and the Smoothing Constant, it provides a dynamic approach to smoothing price data, reducing [noise](../n/noise.md), and responding to price movements more effectively than traditional moving averages. However, its complexity requires a thorough understanding and careful parameter tuning. Despite its limitations, the AMA remains a versatile and valuable tool for traders and portfolio managers aiming to navigate the complexities of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

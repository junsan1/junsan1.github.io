# Average Return

## Introduction

Average [return](../r/return.md) is a fundamental concept in [finance](../f/finance.md) and [investing](../i/investing.md), particularly significant in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) (also known as "algotrading" or "automated trading"). It provides investors and traders with insights into the historical performance of a [financial asset](../f/financial_asset.md), portfolio, or strategy. The average [return](../r/return.md) is a measure used to quantify the central tendency of returns over a specific period. This metric can be calculated in various ways, each here tailored to different analytical needs and scenarios.

## Types of Average Return

### Arithmetic Average Return

The arithmetic average [return](../r/return.md) is the most straightforward calculation of average returns. It is computed by summing up the individual returns and then dividing by the number of periods. Formally, for a set of \( n \) returns \( R_1, R_2, \ldots, R_n \):

\[ 
 \text{Arithmetic Average [Return](../r/return.md)} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} R_i 
\]

This type of average is best used in short-term analysis where [compounding](../c/compounding.md) effects are minimal. It provides a simple estimate of performance over [multiple](../m/multiple.md) periods and is often used in [backtesting trading strategies](../b/backtesting_trading_strategies.md).

### Geometric Average Return

The geometric average [return](../r/return.md), also known as the compounded annual growth rate (CAGR), is more suitable for long-term performance evaluation. It accounts for the effects of [compounding](../c/compounding.md) over [multiple](../m/multiple.md) periods. The formula for \( n \) returns \( R_1, R_2, \ldots, R_n \) is:

\[ 
 \text{Geometric Average [Return](../r/return.md)} = \left( \prod_{i=1}^{n} (1 + R_i) \right)^\frac{1}{n} - 1 
\]

This method is more accurate for assessing the performance sustainability of an [asset](../a/asset.md) or strategy over time as it smooths out [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and highlights [growth trends](../g/growth_trends_in_trading.md).

### Modified Dietz Method

The [Modified Dietz method](../m/modified_dietz_method.md) is an approximation approach that incorporates external cash flows. Itâ€™s particularly useful in scenarios where a portfolio experiences significant cash inflows or outflows. The formula is:

\[ 
 \text{Modified Dietz [Return](../r/return.md)} = \frac{EMV - BMV - C}{BMV + wC} 
\]

- \( EMV \) is the ending [market value](../m/market_value.md).
- \( BMV \) is the beginning [market value](../m/market_value.md).
- \( C \) is the net external [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md).
- \( w \) is the weighting [factor](../f/factor.md) calculated as the fraction of the period the [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) is present.

## Applications in Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading strategies](../a/algorithmic_trading_strategies.md) deploy [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md) and algorithms to execute trades at speeds and frequencies unachievable by human traders. Average [return](../r/return.md) metrics form the backbone of evaluating, [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md), and optimizing these strategies.

### Backtesting

[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) involves running an algorithm on historical data to assess its viability. Average [return](../r/return.md) types, particularly the arithmetic and geometric returns, are crucial to determining how well a strategy would have performed in the past, guiding future decision-making.

### Risk Management

Returns analysis helps in refining the [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) elements of a trading algorithm. By knowing the average returns, traders can design strategies with acceptable [risk](../r/risk.md) levels and set appropriate thresholds for drawdowns, stop losses, and take-profits.

### Performance Metrics

Average returns are also indispensable in constructing [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md), such as the [Sharpe ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md), which adjusts returns by [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for [risk](../r/risk.md) ([standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) of returns). 

\[ 
 \text{[Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md)} = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_p} 
\]

where \( R_p \) is the average [return](../r/return.md) of the portfolio, \( R_f \) is the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate, and \( \sigma_p \) is the [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) of the portfolio returns.

### Portfolio Optimization

In modern portfolio theory, average returns are central to constructing an optimal portfolio. The [mean-variance optimization](../m/mean-variance_optimization.md) technique uses expected returns (geometric average) and [covariance](../c/covariance.md) of [asset](../a/asset.md) returns to maximize returns for a given level of [risk](../r/risk.md).

\[ 
 \text{[Optimization](../o/optimization.md) Objective:} \quad \max_w \left( w^T \mu - \[lambda](../l/lambda.md) w^T \Sigma w \right)
\]

- \( w \) is the weights vector.
- \( \mu \) is the mean returns vector.
- \( \Sigma \) is the [covariance](../c/covariance.md) matrix of returns.
- \( \[lambda](../l/lambda.md) \) is the [risk](../r/risk.md)-aversion coefficient.

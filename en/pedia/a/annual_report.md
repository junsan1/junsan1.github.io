## Key Metrics in an Annual Report

### 1. Earnings Per Share (EPS)

### 2. Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio)
This ratio helps assess the [valuation](../v/valuation.md) of a company in relation to its [earnings](../e/earnings.md). It is calculated as:
\[ \text{P/E Ratio} = \frac{\text{[Market Price](../m/market_price.md) Per Share}}{\text{[Earnings](../e/earnings.md) Per Share}} \]

### 3. Return on Equity (ROE)
ROE measures the profitability generated from shareholders' [equity](../e/equity.md). It is calculated as:
\[ \text{ROE} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Shareholders’ [Equity](../e/equity.md)}} \]

### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio (D/E Ratio)
This ratio evaluates the company’s financial [leverage](../l/leverage.md) by comparing its [total liabilities](../t/total_liabilities.md) to shareholders' [equity](../e/equity.md). It is calculated as:
\[ \text{D/E Ratio} = \frac{\text{[Total Liabilities](../t/total_liabilities.md)}}{\text{Shareholders’ [Equity](../e/equity.md)}} \]

### 5. Current Ratio
The [current ratio](../c/current_ratio.md) measures the company's ability to meet its short-term [obligations](../o/obligation.md) with its short-term assets. It is calculated as:
\[ \text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{[Current Liabilities](../c/current_liabilities.md)}} \]

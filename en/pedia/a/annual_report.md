## Key Metrics in an Annual Report

### 1. Earnings Per Share (EPS)

ROE measures the profitability generated from shareholders' equity. It is calculated as:
\[ \text{ROE} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Shareholders’ Equity}} \]

### 4. Debt to Equity Ratio (D/E Ratio)
This ratio evaluates the company’s financial leverage by comparing its total liabilities to shareholders' equity. It is calculated as:
\[ \text{D/E Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Liabilities}}{\text{Shareholders’ Equity}} \]

### 5. Current Ratio
The current ratio measures the company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its short-term assets. It is calculated as:
\[ \text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}} \]

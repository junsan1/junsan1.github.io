# Amended Return

An amended [return](../r/return.md) is a revised [tax return](../t/tax_return.md) filed to correct errors or to include information not originally reported on an initial [return](../r/return.md). Taxpayers file amended returns to address errors ranging from simple mathematical mistakes to omissions of substantial [income](../i/income.md), credits, or deductions. Typically, for individual filers in the United States, the Form 1040-X is used to file amended returns. Similarly, businesses and corporations have their own versions of forms for filing amended returns, such as the Form 1120X for corporations.

## Purpose of Filing an Amended Return

There are several reasons why taxpayers might need to file an amended [return](../r/return.md). These include:

1. **Error [Correction](../c/correction.md)**: Mistakes on the original [tax return](../t/tax_return.md) need to be corrected. These can include errors in reporting [income](../i/income.md), tax deductions, credits, or even just calculation errors.
2. **Changes in Tax Legislation**: Occasionally, changes in tax laws or IRS regulations may retroactively affect filed returns, necessitating amendments.
3. **New Information**: Sometimes, taxpayers receive additional information after they have filed their initial [return](../r/return.md). This can include late-arriving forms such as W-2s, 1099s, or K-1s.
4. **Net Operating Loss (NOL)**: Corporations or individuals may need to carry back a net operating loss to a previous tax year, which can only be done through an amended [return](../r/return.md).

## Form 1040-X: Structure and Filing

Form 1040-X is structured to allow taxpayers to enter the necessary corrections to the previously filed Form 1040. The form has various parts:

1. **Part I**: Contains fields for personal information such as name, address, [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) Number, and [filing status](../f/filing_status.md).
2. **Part II**: The [accounting](../a/accounting.md) section breaks down the old [return](../r/return.md) figures (Column A), the corrected amounts (Column C), and the net difference between the two (Column B).
3. **Part III**: A detailed explanation section where taxpayers describe the specific reasons for the amendments.
4. **Attachments**: Any necessary schedules or additional forms that support the corrections made on Form 1040-X must be attached.

## Filing Deadlines and Rules

The IRS generally allows three years from the date the original [return](../r/return.md) was filed (or two years from the date the tax was paid, whichever is later) to file an amended [return](../r/return.md) to claim a refund. Itâ€™s important to [note](../n/note.md):

- Amended returns cannot be e-filed in most cases; they must be mailed to the IRS.
- Taxpayers should ensure they have all additional documentation to support the changes.
- In cases of overpayment, [interest](../i/interest.md) may be paid by the IRS on the refunded amount.

## Impact on State Tax Returns

Amending a federal [tax return](../t/tax_return.md) may also necessitate an amended state [tax return](../t/tax_return.md). Each state has its procedures for amending returns, often mirroring the federal process but sometimes with nuances.

## Potential Issues and Considerations

- **Audits**: Filing an amended [return](../r/return.md) may raise red flags with the IRS, increasing the likelihood of an audit.
- **[Statute of Limitations](../s/statute_of_limitations.md)**: Beyond the general three-year rule, certain situations (such as [fraud](../f/fraud.md)) can extend the [statute of limitations](../s/statute_of_limitations.md).

## Tax Software and Professional Help

Many tax preparation software providers, such as TurboTax, H&R Block, and TaxAct, [offer](../o/offer.md) modules specifically designed to [handle](../h/handle.md) amended returns. Professional tax advisors, including CPAs and enrolled agents, can [offer](../o/offer.md) personalized assistance and ensure that all adjustments are correctly reported.

## Examples of Amending Corporate Returns

Corporations may also need to file amended returns for a variety of reasons similar to individual filers. Form 1120X is used by corporations to:

- Correct [income](../i/income.md), deductions, and credits
- Adjust for carryback of Net Operating Losses (NOL)
- Reflect changes due to amended K-1s from partnerships or S Corporations

## International Considerations

For U.S. taxpayers living abroad, special rules apply, and coordinating amendments to both U.S. and foreign tax returns might be necessary to avoid dual [taxation](../t/taxation.md).

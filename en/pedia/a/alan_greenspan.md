# Alan Greenspan

Alan Greenspan, born March 6, 1926, in New York City, is a distinguished American [economist](../e/economist.md) best known for his tenure as Chairman of the Federal Reserve of the United States from 1987 to 2006. Greenspan's tenure, spanning nearly two decades, was marked by significant economic events and challenges, and his policies have been both lauded and criticized by economists and policymakers alike.

## Early Life and Education
Alan Greenspan was born to a Hungarian-Jewish family. He showed an early talent for mathematics and music. Greenspan attended George Washington High School and later enrolled at the prestigious Juilliard School, focusing on clarinet and saxophone. However, his passion for [economics](../e/economics.md) overtook his musical ambitions, and he later attended New York University (NYU), earning a Bachelor of Science in [Economics](../e/economics.md) [summa cum laude](../s/summa_cum_laude.md) in 1948 and a Master of Arts in [Economics](../e/economics.md) in 1950. He also pursued advanced economic studies at Columbia University under the direction of famed [economist](../e/economist.md) Arthur Burns but did not complete his Ph.D. at the time.

## Professional Career 

### Private Sector
Before his long tenure at the Federal Reserve, Greenspan co-founded the economic consulting [firm](../f/firm.md) Townsend-Greenspan & Co., Inc., in 1954, an economic consultancy with which he remained until his appointment to the Federal Reserve in 1987.

### Chairman of the Federal Reserve
Alan Greenspan was appointed Chairman of the Federal Reserve by President Ronald Reagan in August 1987, taking over from Paul Volcker. His term included [multiple](../m/multiple.md) reappointments by subsequent Presidents George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush. 

Greenspan's tenure is often remembered in several key phases:

#### Black Monday (1987 Stock Market Crash)
Just two months after his appointment, Greenspan faced the [stock market crash](../s/stock_market_crash.md) of October 19, 1987, known as [Black Monday](../b/black_monday.md). In response, Greenspan acted swiftly to ensure [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and calm the markets, helping to mitigate the broader economic impact. His actions during this period earned him praise for his crisis management skills.

#### The 1990s Economic Expansion  
During the 1990s, the U.S. experienced the longest peacetime economic [expansion](../e/expansion.md) in its history. Greenspan's policies during this period, characterized by relatively low [inflation](../i/inflation.md) and high growth, garnered substantial acclaim. He supported technological innovation and [productivity](../p/productivity.md) improvements, maintaining a low and stable [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) environment that contributed to the economic boom.

#### The Dot-com Bubble
The late 1990s were also marked by the rapid rise and subsequent burst of the dot-com bubble. While Greenspan noted the "[irrational exuberance](../i/irrational_exuberance.md)" in the markets as early as 1996, he has been criticized for not taking more concrete steps to curb the bubble.

#### Early 2000s and the Housing Bubble
Greenspan's policies post-2000 have been the subject of significant debate. Critics argue that the low [interest](../i/interest.md) rates maintained during the early 2000s contributed to the [housing bubble](../h/housing_bubble.md) that eventually burst in 2007-2008, leading to the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md). Greenspan's response has centered around the view that global [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md) and financial innovations were also critical contributors.

## Later Career and Legacy

After retiring from the Fed in 2006, Greenspan founded Greenspan Associates LLC, a consulting [firm](../f/firm.md) through which he continued to provide economic advice to various clients. He also joined the boards of companies and participated in high-profile speaking engagements.

Greenspan remains a controversial figure, often cited for both the stability and vulnerabilities that characterized his tenure. His memoir, "The Age of Turbulence: Adventures in a New World" (2007), provides an in-depth retrospective on his years at the Federal Reserve and his views on economic policy.

## Criticisms and Controversies

### Monetary Policy and the Financial Crisis
Greenspanâ€™s tenure at the Federal Reserve saw the increasing financialization of the U.S. [economy](../e/economy.md). Critics claim that his approach to [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md), especially his hesitancy to intervene in [asset](../a/asset.md) [bubbles](../b/bubble.md), set the stage for the financial instability that culminated in the 2007-2008 crisis. Scholars and economists debate whether earlier intervention could have softened the impact or prevented the crisis.

### Deregulation
Another major point of contention is Greenspan's support for [deregulation](../d/deregulation.md). During his tenure, several legislative changes reduced restrictions on banking and [credit](../c/credit.md) markets. While proponents argue that these policies helped foster innovation and growth, critics contend they resulted in a lack of oversight and increased [systemic risk](../s/systemic_risk.md).

### Philosophical Perspectives
Greenspan has adhered to a philosophy informed by Objectivism, developed by Ayn Rand, of whom he was a personal acquaintance. His commitment to free-[market](../m/market.md) principles and minimal government intervention reflect this influence extensively, both praised by some and criticized by others for contributing to economic [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

## Publications and Influence

Greenspan has authored several books and many articles that continue to shape economic thought and policy debates. His works, interviews, and public engagements reflect his enduring influence on contemporary [economics](../e/economics.md) and public policy.

### Selected Works

# Adjustable Life Insurance

Adjustable [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md), also known as "flexible [premium](../p/premium.md) adjustable [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md)" or simply "flexible [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md)," is a type of [permanent life insurance](../p/permanent_life_insurance.md) policy that combines the features of both [term life insurance](../t/term_life_insurance.md) and [whole life insurance](../w/whole_life_insurance.md). This unique form of [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) stands out for its adjustable features, allowing policyholders to modify the policy's coverage, [premium](../p/premium.md) payments, and [duration](../d/duration.md) according to evolving financial needs and circumstances. 

## Key Features and Components

### 1. Premium Flexibility
One of the standout features of adjustable [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) is the flexibility it offers in [premium](../p/premium.md) payments. Policyholders have the option to increase or decrease the [premium](../p/premium.md) amounts within specified limits set by the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) company. This can be particularly advantageous during periods of financial instability or when there is a change in [income](../i/income.md). 

### 2. Adjustable Coverage Amount
Policyholders can adjust the [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) or the [face value](../f/face_value.md) of the policy. This makes it possible to increase coverage during periods requiring higher protection, such as when starting a family or covering a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md). Conversely, it also allows for decreasing the coverage when less protection is needed, usually later in life.

### 3. Cash Value Accumulation
Like [whole life insurance](../w/whole_life_insurance.md), adjustable [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policies accumulate cash [value](../v/value.md) over time. The cash [value](../v/value.md) earns [interest](../i/interest.md) based on the insurer's investment portfolio, and policyholders can borrow against or withdraw from this accumulated cash [value](../v/value.md).

### 4. Death Benefit Options
Flexible [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policies often [offer](../o/offer.md) [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) [options](../o/options.md). Policyholders can choose between a level [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md), which remains constant throughout the policy's [duration](../d/duration.md), or an increasing [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md), which adjusts according to the accumulated cash [value](../v/value.md) plus the face amount of the policy.

### 5. Conversion Options
Many adjustable [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policies come with conversion [options](../o/options.md) that allow for changing the form of the policy without undergoing new [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md). For instance, a term life portion can be converted into a whole life portion as financial circumstances evolve.

## Types of Adjustable Life Insurance

### 1. Universal Life Insurance
[Universal life insurance](../u/universal_life_insurance.md) is one of the most common forms of adjustable [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md). It offers [premium](../p/premium.md) flexibility, [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) adjustability, and cash [value](../v/value.md) accumulation features that can be adjusted based on [interest](../i/interest.md) credits and the performance of [underlying](../u/underlying.md) investments.

### 2. Variable Universal Life Insurance
Variable [universal life insurance](../u/universal_life_insurance.md) combines the flexible features of [universal life insurance](../u/universal_life_insurance.md) with an investment component. Policyholders can allocate a portion of their [premium](../p/premium.md) payments to a variety of investment [options](../o/options.md) such as [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, or mutual funds, allowing for the potential of higher cash [value](../v/value.md) growth.

### 3. Indexed Universal Life Insurance
Indexed [universal life insurance](../u/universal_life_insurance.md) (IUL) policies [offer](../o/offer.md) [premium](../p/premium.md) and [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) flexibility, similar to [universal life insurance](../u/universal_life_insurance.md) but with cash [value](../v/value.md) growth linked to a specific [market index](../m/market_index.md). The [interest](../i/interest.md) credited to the cash [value](../v/value.md) depends on the performance of the chosen [index](../i/index_instrument.md), usually subject to certain caps and floors.

## Benefits and Advantages

### 1. Adaptability
The primary advantage of adjustable [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) is its adaptability. Policyholders can tweak the policy features to align with changing financial goals and life events. This can provide peace of mind and financial [security](../s/security.md) in diverse circumstances.

### 2. Cash Value Benefits
The cash [value](../v/value.md) component of adjustable [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) provides a savings element that can be accessed through loans or withdrawals. This feature can serve as an [emergency fund](../e/emergency_fund.md), educational [fund](../f/fund.md), or retirement supplement.

### 3. Estate Planning
Adjustable [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) can be an effective tool for [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md), [offering](../o/offering.md) tax benefits and ensuring that beneficiaries receive an adequate [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md). The ability to adjust coverage helps maintain appropriate benefit levels throughout the policyholder's life.

### 4. Flexibility in Risk Management
Policyholders can manage their [risk](../r/risk.md) more effectively with adjustable [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) by altering premiums and benefits as their tolerance for [risk](../r/risk.md) changes. This flexibility can be crucial in maintaining financial stability and planning for the future.

## Drawbacks and Considerations

### 1. Complexity
Adjustable [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policies can be complex to understand and manage. The multitude of adjustable features requires careful monitoring and decision-making, making it less suitable for individuals looking for simplicity in their [insurance](../i/insurance.md) coverage.

### 2. Cost
Premiums for adjustable [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policies are generally higher than those for [term life insurance](../t/term_life_insurance.md) due to the added flexibility and cash [value](../v/value.md) component. Policyholders must weigh the benefits against the higher costs to determine if it's the right fit for their financial situation.

### 3. Market Risk (for Variable Components)
For those policies with investment [options](../o/options.md), such as variable universal life, the cash [value](../v/value.md) is subject to [market risk](../m/market_risk.md). Poor investment performance can result in lower cash [value](../v/value.md) accumulation and may require additional premiums to keep the policy in force.

### 4. Loans and Withdrawals Impact
While borrowing against the cash [value](../v/value.md) offers [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), it can also impact the policy's [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) if the [loan](../l/loan.md) is not repaid. Withdrawals can similarly diminish the cash [value](../v/value.md) and [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md), potentially affecting the policy's effectiveness.

## Choosing the Right Adjustable Life Insurance Policy

### 1. Assess Financial Goals
Before selecting an adjustable [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) policy, individuals should thoroughly assess their financial goals, [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md), and long-term planning needs. This assessment includes considering the likely stages in life that [will](../w/will.md) require adjustments to coverage and premiums.

### 2. Insurance Company Reputation
Choosing a reputable [insurance](../i/insurance.md) company with a solid financial [rating](../r/rating.md) is crucial to ensure the policy remains viable in the long term. Companies like Prudential, MetLife, and Northwestern Mutual [offer](../o/offer.md) adjustable [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) products and are well-regarded in the [industry](../i/industry.md).

### 3. Understanding the Policy's Terms
A comprehensive understanding of the policy's terms, conditions, and limitations is essential. Prospective policyholders should review how [premium](../p/premium.md) adjustments affect the policy, the limitations on [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md) changes, and any associated fees.

### 4. Professional Guidance
Consulting with a [financial advisor](../f/financial_advisor.md) or [insurance](../i/insurance.md) agent with expertise in adjustable [life insurance](../l/life_insurance.md) can provide valuable insights and assist in selecting the most appropriate policy. They can help navigate the complexities and ensure the policy aligns with one's financial strategy.

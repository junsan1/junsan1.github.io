# Animal Spirits

"Animal spirits" is a term initially coined by the famous [economist](../e/economist.md) [John Maynard Keynes](../j/john_maynard_keynes.md) in his seminal work, "The General Theory of Employment, [Interest](../i/interest.md), and [Money](../m/money.md)," published in 1936. The term encapsulates the human emotions that influence consumer and [business](../b/business.md) behavior, including feelings of confidence, [trust](../t/trust.md), and optimism or pessimism. Keynes argued these animal spirits are the psychological and emotional factors that drive economic decision-making beyond conventional financial models and mathematical predictions.

## Introduction

In economic contexts, "animal spirits" refer to the instincts, predilections, and emotions that ostensibly guide human behavior in conditions of [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md). These unquantifiable factors compel entrepreneurs to undertake investments, consumers to spend, and governments to implement policies. Keynes posited that traditional economic theories, which assume [rational behavior](../r/rational_behavior.md), do not fully capture the [variability](../v/variability.md) of [economic cycles](../e/economic_cycles.md). He believed that consumer confidence, speculative [bubbles](../b/bubble.md), and sudden [market](../m/market.md) changes are all products of animal spirits.

## Historical Context

### Keynes and the Concept

[John Maynard Keynes](../j/john_maynard_keynes.md) developed the theory during the [Great Depression](../g/great_depression.md), a period marked by economic instability, high [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md), and [deflation](../d/deflation.md). Keynes observed that mere changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates or other traditional economic levers were insufficient to stimulate spending and investment. Instead, he asserted that boosting the [economy](../e/economy.md) required understanding and influencing human psychology and sentiment. As such, "animal spirits" became a foundational concept in [Keynesian economics](../k/keynesian_economics_in_trading.md).

### Evolution of the Concept

After Keynes, the term "animal spirits" evolved and found a place in discussions about [market](../m/market.md) behavior and [economic cycles](../e/economic_cycles.md). The term gained broader acceptance in explaining phenomena like [stock market](../s/stock_market.md) [bubbles](../b/bubble.md), [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) crises, and rapid shifts in consumer spending.

Economists George Akerlof and Robert Shiller revived and extended Keynes's ideas in their book "Animal Spirits: How Human Psychology Drives the [Economy](../e/economy.md), and Why It Matters for Global [Capitalism](../c/capitalism.md)" (2009). Akerlof and Shiller argued that economists should pay more attention to psychological motivators and less to strictly rational models to understand fluctuations in macroeconomic variables like gross domestic product (GDP), [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, and [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

## Components of Animal Spirits

### Confidence

Confidence is one of the most crucial elements of animal spirits. High levels of confidence among consumers and businesses can lead to increased spending, investment, and [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md). Conversely, a lack of confidence can result in reduced spending and investment, leading to economic slowdowns or recessions.

### Fairness

Fairness pertains to the perception of just treatment in economic transactions. Peopleâ€™s sentiment about whether they are being treated fairly in wages, prices, or contracts can significantly influence economic behavior. Akerlof and Shiller underscored the importance of social norms and fairness in economic decisions, challenging the traditional notion that transactions are purely based on cost-benefit analyses.

### Corruption and Bad Faith

Perceived corruption and dishonesty can severely dampen economic activity by eroding [trust](../t/trust.md). When people believe that [business](../b/business.md) practices or [government policies](../g/government_policies_in_trading.md) are corrupt, they are less likely to engage in economic activities or comply with regulations. [Trust](../t/trust.md) is a crucial [factor](../f/factor.md) in the smooth functioning of markets and economies.

### Money Illusion

[Money illusion](../m/money_illusion.md) refers to the tendency of people to think of [currency](../c/currency.md) in [nominal](../n/nominal.md) terms rather than real terms. For instance, a worker might focus on their paycheck amount rather than its [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md). This illusion can affect spending, saving, and investment decisions, often leading to suboptimal economic outcomes.

## Implications for Economic Policy

### Monetary Policy

Understanding animal spirits can help central banks and policymakers design more effective monetary policies. Central banks might use forward [guidance](../g/guidance.md), communicating future policy intentions clearly to influence expectations and confidence levels. This approach aims to manage public sentiment and its impact on economic behavior.

### Fiscal Policy

Governments can steer animal spirits through fiscal measures such as public spending, tax breaks, and subsidies. During economic recessions, Keynesian economic policy would advocate for increased government spending to boost confidence and stimulate economic activity.

### Regulatory Policies

To combat corruption and promote fairness, [robust](../r/robust.md) regulatory frameworks are essential. Fair and transparent systems build [trust](../t/trust.md), encouraging investment and participation in economic activities.

## Animal Spirits in Financial Markets

### Stock Market Dynamics

Animal spirits play a significant role in stock [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md), influencing [investor](../i/investor.md) behavior and [market](../m/market.md) trends. Booms and busts in stock markets are often driven by shifts in [investor](../i/investor.md) sentiment rather than changes in fundamentals. [Investor](../i/investor.md) psychology can lead to speculative [bubbles](../b/bubble.md) where [asset](../a/asset.md) prices exceed their [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md), followed by sharp corrections when the bubble bursts.

### Housing Markets

Similar to stock markets, housing markets are also susceptible to animal spirits. During periods of optimism, individuals might overestimate future house price increases, leading to speculative buying. Conversely, during downturns, pessimism can cause sharp declines in housing prices, affecting homeowners and the broader [economy](../e/economy.md).

### Business Investment Decisions

[Business](../b/business.md) investment decisions are profoundly affected by animal spirits. During periods of high confidence, firms are more likely to invest in new projects, facilities, and technology, driving [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md). On the other hand, during times of [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) or pessimism, firms may cut back on investment, contributing to economic slowdowns.

## Modern Interpretations and Applications

### Behavioral Economics

[Behavioral economics](../b/behavioral_economics.md) extensively incorporates the concept of animal spirits to explain real-world deviations from standard economic models. Psychologists and economists collaborate to study how factors such as overconfidence, [loss aversion](../l/loss_aversion.md), and [herd behavior](../h/herd_behavior_in_trading.md) influence economic decisions. Notable works in this field include Daniel Kahneman's "Thinking, Fast and Slow" and Richard Thaler's "Nudge."

### Modern Economic Theory

Modern economic theories often integrate aspects of animal spirits to provide more comprehensive models of economic behavior. Econometric models may include variables that [proxy](../p/proxy.md) for sentiment or confidence, aiming to better capture the reality of economic fluctuations.

## Criticisms and Limitations

### Lack of Quantifiability

One criticism of the concept of animal spirits is the difficulty in quantifying psychological and emotional factors. Traditional economic models rely on measurable variables, and incorporating intangible factors like sentiment poses challenges.

### Overemphasis on Psychology

Some critics argue that emphasizing animal spirits might lead to an overreliance on psychological explanations at the [expense](../e/expense.md) of structural economic factors. They contend that economic issues like [income inequality](../i/income_inequality.md), [labor market](../l/labor_market.md) rigidities, and technological advancements require more attention.

### Policy Implementation Challenges

Implementing policies based on animal spirits may be complex. Influencing public sentiment and confidence involves more than just economic measures; it requires consistent communication, [transparency](../t/transparency.md), and sometimes even cultural shifts. Policymakers might find these softer aspects harder to manage than traditional economic tools.

## Conclusion

Animal spirits play an indispensable role in economic theory and policy, providing a more nuanced understanding of human behavior and its impact on economic outcomes. While traditional economic models focus on rational decision-making, acknowledging psychological and emotional factors enriches the analytical framework. By incorporating animal spirits, economists and policymakers can better anticipate and respond to economic fluctuations, ultimately fostering more stable and prosperous economies.

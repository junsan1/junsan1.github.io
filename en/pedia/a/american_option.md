# American Option

In the realm of [financial derivatives](../f/financial_derivatives.md), an American option is a type of [options contract](../o/options_contract.md) that can be exercised at any time before its [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md). This characteristic offers greater flexibility compared to its European counterpart, which can only be exercised at [maturity](../m/maturity.md). Due to this flexibility, American [options](../o/options.md) often command a higher [premium](../p/premium.md) in the [market](../m/market.md). 

## Characteristics of American Options

### Exercise Flexibility
The most distinctive feature of an American option is the ability of the option holder to [exercise](../e/exercise.md) the right to buy or sell the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at any moment up until the [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md). This ability to [exercise](../e/exercise.md) early is particularly advantageous in situations where the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) pays dividends, when there is a sharp rise or fall in the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), or other [market](../m/market.md) conditions that might make [early exercise](../e/early_exercise.md) beneficial.

### Underlying Assets
American [options](../o/options.md) can be based on a wide array of [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets, such as individual [stocks](../s/stock.md), commodities, indices, or [exchange](../e/exchange.md)-traded funds (ETFs). The variety of [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets allows for tactical investment strategies and hedging opportunities.

## Pricing American Options

The flexibility to [exercise](../e/exercise.md) at any point makes the pricing of American [options](../o/options.md) more complex compared to [European options](../e/european_options.md). The most common methodologies used for pricing American [options](../o/options.md) are:

### Binomial Option Pricing Model
This model uses a discrete-time lattice-based approach, where the price is modeled as a tree with each node representing possible future prices of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

### Black-Scholes-Merton Model
Although primarily used for [European options](../e/european_options.md), the [Black-Scholes model](../b/black-scholes_model.md) can be adapted slightly to provide a [baseline](../b/baseline.md) for American [options](../o/options.md) by [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for [early exercise](../e/early_exercise.md) through various approximations and adjustments.

### Monte Carlo Simulations
[Monte Carlo methods](../m/monte_carlo_methods.md) [leverage](../l/leverage.md) [computational algorithms](../c/computational_algorithms.md) to simulate the various paths the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) could take, helping in estimating the option price by averaging the outcomes of [multiple](../m/multiple.md) scenarios.

## Factors Influencing American Options

### Time to Expiration
The [value](../v/value.md) of an American option typically decreases as it approaches its [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md), a phenomenon known as [time decay](../t/time_decay.md). However, because of the [early exercise](../e/early_exercise.md) feature, the rate of decay can differ from that of [European options](../e/european_options.md).

### Volatility
The greater the [volatility](../v/volatility.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), the higher the [option premium](../o/option_premium.md). High [volatility](../v/volatility.md) increases the probability that the option [will](../w/will.md) move into the [money](../m/money.md), thus making it more valuable.

### Dividends
For American call [options](../o/options.md), anticipated dividends on the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock can impact the decision to [exercise](../e/exercise.md) early. If a substantial [dividend](../d/dividend.md) [payment](../p/payment.md) is expected, the option holder might choose to [exercise](../e/exercise.md) the option before the [ex-dividend](../e/ex-dividend.md) date to capture the [dividend](../d/dividend.md) [payout](../p/payout.md).

### Interest Rates
Changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates can affect the option’s [premium](../p/premium.md). Rising [interest](../i/interest.md) rates generally make call [options](../o/options.md) more valuable and [put options](../p/put_options.md) less valuable, and vice versa.

## Uses and Strategies

American [options](../o/options.md) are versatile financial instruments that can be utilized for various [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), including but not limited to:

### Hedging
Investors use American [options](../o/options.md) to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against potential losses in their portfolios. For instance, owning [put options](../p/put_options.md) on an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) can protect against [downside risk](../d/downside_risk.md).

### Speculation
Traders can speculate on the future direction of an [asset](../a/asset.md)’s price using American [options](../o/options.md). Calls are bought if a price increase is expected, while puts are purchased if a price decrease is anticipated.

### Covered Call Writing
This conservative strategy involves holding a long position in an [asset](../a/asset.md) while simultaneously writing (selling) call [options](../o/options.md) on the same [asset](../a/asset.md). This generates additional [income](../i/income.md) through the received premiums.

### Protective Puts
This strategy entails buying a [put option](../p/put.md) for an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) that is already owned. It serves as an [insurance](../i/insurance.md) policy against a downward price movement.

## Market for American Options

### Exchanges
American [options](../o/options.md) are primarily traded on major exchanges such as the Chicago Board [Options](../o/options.md) [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (CBOE) and the [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md) [Options](../o/options.md) [Market](../m/market.md). These exchanges provide a regulated environment where [options](../o/options.md) can be bought and sold with [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).

### Brokers
Several brokerage platforms facilitate the trading of American [options](../o/options.md). These include:

* [TD Ameritrade](https://www.tdameritrade.com)

### Over-the-Counter (OTC)
Aside from exchanges, American [options](../o/options.md) can also be traded over-the-counter (OTC), where the terms of the option contract can be more customized. However, OTC trading involves higher [counterparty risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md) and less [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).

## American Options in Popular Culture

While American [options](../o/options.md) have largely remained a topic of [interest](../i/interest.md) within financial circles, they sometimes find their way into broader discussions concerning stock markets and investments. Movies like "The Wolf of [Wall Street](../w/wall_street.md)" and books on trading and [investing](../i/investing.md) often touch upon the utilization of [options](../o/options.md) as a part of complex [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

## Regulatory Environment

The trading of American [options](../o/options.md), like other financial instruments, is governed by regulations established by bodies such as the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) in the United States. These regulations aim to ensure [market](../m/market.md) integrity, protect investors, and maintain fair practices within the [options](../o/options.md) [market](../m/market.md).

### Tax Implications
Gains and losses from trading American [options](../o/options.md) are subject to [taxation](../t/taxation.md). The specific tax treatment can vary based on whether the positions are held short-term or long-term, among other factors. It is advisable for traders to consult with a tax professional to understand the implications fully.

## Conclusion

American [options](../o/options.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) unique advantages due to their [exercise](../e/exercise.md) flexibility, making them attractive for hedging, [speculation](../s/speculation.md), and [income](../i/income.md)-generation strategies. However, their [valuation](../v/valuation.md) is more intricate, requiring comprehensive models to account for the possibility of [early exercise](../e/early_exercise.md). As such, they remain a sophisticated tool within the realm of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), combining potential rewards with complexity and [risk](../r/risk.md).

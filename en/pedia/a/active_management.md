# Active Management

Active management is an [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) wherein the manager takes an active role in buying and selling securities with the objective of outperforming an investment [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [index](../i/index.md). Unlike passive management, where the investment portfolio is designed to replicate a specific [index](../i/index.md), active managers rely on their research, foresight, and [judgment](../j/judgment.md) to build a portfolio that [will](../w/will.md) achieve better returns.

### Goals and Objectives
The primary goal of active management is to achieve returns that exceed the performance of a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [index](../i/index.md), such as the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Active managers aim to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on [market](../m/market.md) inefficiencies by identifying over-valued and under-valued securities. This requires a thorough analysis of individual companies, industries, and macroeconomic conditions to make informed investment decisions.

### Strategies and Tactics

#### Stock Picking
One of the most common strategies in active management is stock picking. Active managers conduct detailed research on individual [stocks](../s/stock.md) to identify those that they believe [will](../w/will.md) [outperform](../o/outperform.md) the [market](../m/market.md). This involves analyzing [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md), assessing management quality, and understanding the competitive landscape within which the company operates.

#### Market Timing
[Market timing](../m/market_timing.md) involves making buy and sell decisions based on predictions of future [market](../m/market.md) movements. This can include timing investments to benefit from seasonal patterns, [economic cycles](../e/economic_cycles.md), or reacting to geopolitical events.

#### Sector Rotation
[Sector rotation](../s/sector_rotation.md) is a strategy where an active manager shifts investments among different sectors of the [economy](../e/economy.md). For example, if a manager believes that technology [stocks](../s/stock.md) [will](../w/will.md) [outperform](../o/outperform.md) healthcare [stocks](../s/stock.md) in the coming year, they might increase their [holdings](../h/holdings.md) in technology companies while reducing their exposure to healthcare.

#### Arbitrage
[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) involves taking advantage of price discrepancies between different markets or securities. For instance, an active manager might buy a [security](../s/security.md) in one [market](../m/market.md) where it’s [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) and simultaneously sell it in another [market](../m/market.md) where it’s [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md).

### Tools and Techniques

#### Fundamental Analysis
[Fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md) involves evaluating a [security](../s/security.md) by examining various qualitative and quantitative factors such as [earnings](../e/earnings.md), revenues, and assets. The goal is to determine a company's [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) to judge whether the stock is [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) or [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md).

#### Technical Analysis
[Technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) focuses on statistical trends gathered from trading activity, such as price movement and [volume](../v/volume.md). Tools used in [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) include charts and other [market indicators](../m/market_indicators.md) to forecast future price movements.

#### Quantitative Analysis
[Quantitative analysis](../q/quantitative_analysis.md) utilizes [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md) to assess investment opportunities. These models can [range](../r/range.md) from simple [financial ratios](../f/financial_ratios.md) to complex computer algorithms, which can analyze vast amounts of data to identify trading opportunities.

### Advantages

#### Potential for Higher Returns
The most significant advantage of active management is the potential for higher returns. An adept active manager can exploit [market](../m/market.md) inefficiencies to generate [alpha](../a/alpha.md), which is the additional [return](../r/return.md) on an investment over a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md).

#### Flexibility
Active management allows for more flexibility compared to passive strategies. Managers can adjust their portfolios in response to [market](../m/market.md) conditions, making them more adaptable to changing environments.

#### Risk Management
Active managers can employ various [risk management techniques](../r/risk_management_techniques.md) to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against potential losses. For instance, they might use [options](../o/options.md) or [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) to protect their portfolios from [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

### Disadvantages

#### Higher Costs
Active management typically involves higher fees compared to passive management. These costs can include management fees, [transaction fees](../t/transaction_fees.md), and research costs, all of which can eat into overall returns.

#### Inconsistent Performance
Despite the potential for higher returns, active management does not guarantee consistent outperformance of the [market](../m/market.md). Many active managers [underperform](../u/underperform.md) their benchmarks after fees and expenses.

#### Requires Expertise
Effective active management requires a high level of expertise and experience. It can be challenging for investors to identify skilled managers who have the ability to consistently [outperform](../o/outperform.md) the [market](../m/market.md).

### Real-World Applications

#### Hedge Funds
[Hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds are one of the most prominent examples of active management. These investment vehicles employ a variety of strategies, such as [long/short equity](../l/long_short_equity.md), [market](../m/market.md)-[neutral](../n/neutral.md), and [global macro](../g/global_macro.md), to achieve superior returns.

#### Mutual Funds
Many mutual funds are actively managed, with portfolio managers making decisions about which securities to buy and sell. Examples of companies that [offer](../o/offer.md) actively managed mutual funds include Fidelity (https://www.fidelity.com) and T. Rowe Price (https://www.troweprice.com).

#### Private Equity
[Private equity](../p/private_equity.md) firms invest directly in private companies or conduct buyouts of public companies. These investments require active management to improve operational efficiencies and drive growth, which can lead to substantial returns.

### Performance Measurement

#### Alpha
[Alpha](../a/alpha.md) measures the [excess return](../e/excess_return.md) of an investment relative to the [return](../r/return.md) of a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [index](../i/index.md). Positive [alpha](../a/alpha.md) indicates outperformance, while negative [alpha](../a/alpha.md) indicates underperformance.

#### Sharpe Ratio
The [Sharpe ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) assesses the performance of an investment compared to a [risk-free asset](../r/risk-free_asset.md), after adjusting for its [risk](../r/risk.md). The higher the [Sharpe ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md), the better the [risk-adjusted return](../r/risk-adjusted_return.md).

#### Beta
[Beta](../b/beta.md) measures a portfolio's [volatility](../v/volatility.md) relative to the [market](../m/market.md). A [beta](../b/beta.md) greater than 1 indicates greater [volatility](../v/volatility.md), while a [beta](../b/beta.md) less than 1 indicates less [volatility](../v/volatility.md) compared to the [market](../m/market.md).

### Conclusion
Active management is a dynamic and complex [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) that aims to [outperform](../o/outperform.md) [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) indices through various techniques such as stock picking, [market timing](../m/market_timing.md), and [sector rotation](../s/sector_rotation.md). While it offers the potential for higher returns and added flexibility, it also comes with higher costs and requires significant expertise. As such, investors must carefully consider these factors when choosing between active and passive management strategies.

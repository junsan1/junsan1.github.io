# American Stock Exchange (AMEX)

## Definition

The American Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (AMEX), now known as NYSE American, is a platform for trading equities, [options](../o/options.md), and [exchange](../e/exchange.md)-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States. It is one of the primary stock exchanges in the country and was historically known for listing smaller companies compared to those [listed](../l/listed.md) on the New York Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (NYSE). The AMEX has historically been associated with a [wide variety](../w/wide_variety.md) of innovative financial products.

## History

### Origins and Early History

The American Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) was founded in 1908 as the New York Curb [Market](../m/market.md) Agency. The term "curb trading" referred to its original location: traders would gather on the curb outside the NYSE to [trade](../t/trade.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) that were not [listed](../l/listed.md) on the NYSE. The name "Curb" reflected the fact that trading took place literally on the edge of the street, at 23 [Wall Street](../w/wall_street.md). The [exchange](../e/exchange.md) had a somewhat informal atmosphere relative to the NYSE, which was more established and rigid.

### Formal Establishment

In 1921, the New York Curb [Market](../m/market.md) moved indoors, which marked a significant transformation in its operations and professionalism. This transition to a formal trading floor located at 86 Trinity Place in Manhattan allowed for better organization and regulation of transactions. Subsequently, in 1953, the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rebranded itself as the American Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) to better reflect its expanded operations and national significance.

### Innovations and Products

AMEX has been noted for pioneering various innovative financial instruments and trading practices. It introduced the first [equity options](../e/equity_options.md) trading program in 1975, which marked a significant evolution in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) by allowing investors to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) risks and speculate on stock movements. Furthermore, AMEX was instrumental in the development of [exchange](../e/exchange.md)-traded funds (ETFs), launching the first ETF in 1993—a product that would eventually revolutionize [global investment strategies](../g/global_investment_strategies.md).

### Acquisition by NYSE Euronext

In 2008, the American Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) was acquired by NYSE [Euronext](../e/euronext.md), which operates the New York Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md). Under new ownership, AMEX continued to operate as a distinct [market](../m/market.md) but gradually took on the new moniker—NYSE American. The [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) aimed to [leverage](../l/leverage.md) the strengths of both exchanges and [offer](../o/offer.md) a broader [range](../r/range.md) of financial products and trading services.

## Current Name and Operations

Today, the American Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) is known as NYSE American. It continues to serve as a platform for trading equities, [options](../o/options.md), and ETFs, maintaining its historical focus on smaller-cap companies and innovative securities. NYSE American has retained its reputation for flexibility and innovation, and it continues to support a diverse [range](../r/range.md) of financial products.

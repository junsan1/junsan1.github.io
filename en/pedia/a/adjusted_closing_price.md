# Adjusted Closing Price

The adjusted closing price is a stock's closing price on any given trading day that has been amended to include any distributions and corporate actions that occurred at any time before the next day’s [open](../o/open.md). These adjustments take into account events such as dividends, stock splits, rights offerings, and new share issuances. This figure is critical for investors and traders because it provides a more accurate representation of the stock’s [value](../v/value.md) and performance over time.

## Importance of the Adjusted Closing Price

### Accurate Historical Data
The adjusted closing price is essential for creating precise historical charts and for performing accurate historical performance analysis. Without it, comparisons over time would be misleading due to the changes in stock price caused by corporate actions that are not related to the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) performance of the company.

### Dividend Adjustments
Dividends can play a significant role in the returns of long-term investors. The adjusted closing price accounts for dividends and thus provides a [total return](../t/total_return.md) picture of the stock’s performance. For instance, if a stock pays a high regular [dividend](../d/dividend.md), the unadjusted closing price might not accurately reflect the total returns to the [investor](../i/investor.md).

### Splits and Reverse Splits
When a stock undergoes a split or a reverse split, the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) outstanding and the stock price are adjusted accordingly. The adjusted closing price reflects these changes to provide a consistent comparison over time. For example, in a 2-for-1 [stock split](../s/stock_split.md), the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) doubles, and the price per share halves. The adjusted closing price [will](../w/will.md) modify historical prices to reflect this so that performance analysis remains coherent.

### Calculation of Returns
When calculating returns, using the adjusted closing price allows for the inclusion of all factors that impact a stock’s overall performance. This provides investors with a more accurate measure of [historical returns](../h/historical_returns.md) which can be critical for decision-making processes.

## Calculation of Adjusted Closing Price

The formula for the adjusted closing price is not standardized and can vary by data provider, but it generally follows the principle of adjusting historical prices to reflect all subsequent splits and dividends. Here’s a simplified version of the calculation:

\[ \text{Adjusted Closing Price} = \frac{\text{Closing Price}}{\text{Adjustment [Factor](../f/factor.md)}} \]

The adjustment [factor](../f/factor.md) is a combination of historical adjustments for splits and dividends. 

### Example Calculation

Let’s consider a stock that has undergone the following events:
- A 1-for-2 [reverse stock split](../r/reverse_stock_split.md)
- A $1 [dividend](../d/dividend.md)

If the closing price before the [dividend](../d/dividend.md) and split was $50, the adjusted closing price would be calculated as follows:

1. **[Reverse Stock Split](../r/reverse_stock_split.md) Adjustment**  
   A reverse split halves the number of [shares](../s/shares.md), doubling the price:
   \[ \text{Pre-[Dividend](../d/dividend.md) Split Price} = 50 \times 2 = 100 \]

2. **[Dividend](../d/dividend.md) Adjustment**  
   Subtract the [dividend](../d/dividend.md) from the post-split price:
   \[ \text{Adjusted Price} = 100 - 1 = 99 \]

In this simple example, the adjusted closing price accounts for the corporate actions to provide an accurate representation of the stock’s [value](../v/value.md) post-events.

## Usage in Trading Strategies

Using adjusted closing prices in [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) ensures that the results reflect true [market](../m/market.md) scenarios, [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for corporate actions, and providing more reliable conclusions.

### Portfolio Management

## Conclusion

By [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for corporate actions like dividends and splits, it offers a more accurate representation of a stock’s historical performance, facilitates effective comparison over time, and is indispensable for reliable [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) and [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md). Utilizing adjusted closing prices helps investors make more informed decisions, contributing to better [portfolio management](../p/par.md) and strategic planning.

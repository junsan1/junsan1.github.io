# Absolute Return Strategies

Absolute return strategies aim to generate positive returns regardless of market conditions. Unlike traditional strategies that benchmark performance against a market index, absolute return strategies focus on achieving consistent positive returns in both rising and falling markets. These strategies are often associated with hedge funds and other managed investment products. Below, we delve into the different methodologies, instruments, and characteristics of absolute return strategies.

## Types of Absolute Return Strategies

### 1. Market Neutral Strategies
[Market neutral strategies](../m/market_neutral_strategies.md) aim to minimize market risk by taking long and short positions in various stocks or securities. These positions are structured to offset each other, helping to provide a return that is largely independent of the overall market movements.

**Example:**
A hedge fund might take a long position in undervalued stocks while simultaneously taking short positions in overvalued stocks. The goal is to achieve a "neutral" exposure to market risk, while profiting from the relative performance of the selected stocks.

### 2. Arbitrage Strategies
[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategies exploit price discrepancies between related securities. By simultaneously buying and selling similar or related instruments, traders can lock in risk-free profits.

#### Subtypes:
- **Convertible [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md):** Involves buying convertible securities (such as bonds) and shorting the underlying common stocks.
- **Merger [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md):** Capitalizes on price differences between the current market price of a target company's stock and the offer price in a proposed acquisition.

**Example:**
If Company A announces the acquisition of Company B at a share price higher than Company B's current trading price, an arbitrageur might buy shares of Company B and short shares of Company A, expecting to profit from the eventual price convergence.

### 3. Statistical Arbitrage
Statistical [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) involves using [quantitative models](../q/quantitative_models.md) to identify and exploit pricing inefficiencies. Techniques often include [mean reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md) strategies and [pairs trading](../p/pairs_trading.md), where traders simultaneously buy and sell correlated assets to achieve market-neutral exposure.

**Example:**
A trader might use historical price data and sophisticated algorithms to find pairs of stocks (e.g., two technology companies) that typically move together. When the prices diverge beyond a certain threshold, the trader could buy the underperforming stock and short the outperforming stock, expecting the prices to converge.

### 4. Event-Driven Strategies
Event-driven strategies seek to capitalize on price movements stemming from specific events such as mergers, acquisitions, restructurings, or [earnings announcements](../e/earnings_announcements.md). 

**Example:**
- **Merger [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md):** As discussed, involves taking positions based on announced mergers.
- **Distressed Securities:** Focuses on companies in financial distress, betting that the securities might recover in value.

### 5. Global Macro
[Global macro strategies](../g/global_macro_strategies.md) involve taking long and short positions in various equity, fixed income, currency, and commodities marketsâ€”and are driven by broad economic and political views.

**Example:**
A fund manager might take a long position in Japanese yen while shorting the euro, based on economic forecasts and geopolitical risk assessments.

### 6. Multi-Strategy
Multi-strategy funds diversify across multiple absolute return methodologies to reduce risk and enhance returns. This involves simultaneously employing different strategies like market neutral, [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), and event-driven within a single fund.

**Example:**
A multi-strategy fund might allocate a portion of its capital to statistical [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), another portion to event-driven strategies, and yet another to global macro plays.

## Key Characteristics of Absolute Return Strategies
- **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md):** Strategies often feature advanced [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) techniques, including [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md), hedging, and diversification.
- **Leverage:** Some absolute return strategies, especially those employed by hedge funds, may use leverage to amplify returns.
- **Liquidity:** Strategies may focus on highly liquid securities to ensure quick entry and exit from trades, although some might take positions in less liquid markets.
- **Sophistication:** These strategies typically require advanced understanding of financial markets, [quantitative models](../q/quantitative_models.md), and economic indicator analysis.
- **Transparency:** Lower transparency compared to traditional mutual funds, often due to the proprietary nature of the strategies used.

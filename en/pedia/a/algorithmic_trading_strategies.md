[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), also known as algotrading, employs computer programs to trade in modern financial markets. Algorithms use rules and predetermined instructions coded into software to automatically make trading decisions. It leverages technology to execute orders containing multiple variables more efficiently than human traders. [Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) enables high-frequency trading (HFT), where transactions can be executed at blistering speeds, sometimes completing in mere milliseconds. This automated trading often results in lower transaction costs and improved market liquidity. Understanding various [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) strategies is key to benefiting from this technological advancement.

# Algorithmic Trading Strategies

## 1. Trend Following Strategies

**[Trend following](../t/trend_following.md)** strategies are among the oldest and simplest [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) strategies. The primary principle behind [trend following](../t/trend_following.md) is that prices tend to move in trends, either upward or downward. Algoritms designed for [trend following](../t/trend_following.md) strategies typically rely on [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) such as moving averages, breakouts, and [momentum indicators](../m/momentum_indicators.md).

- **Moving Averages**: Moving averages smooth out price data to identify the direction of the trend. Simple moving averages (SMA) and exponential moving averages (EMA) are common tools used. A popular trend-following technique is the Moving Average Crossover, where a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average, signaling a buy, or crosses below signaling a sell.

- **Channel Breakouts**: In this strategy, a buy order is triggered when the price breaks above a predetermined resistance level, while a sell order is flagged when it drops below a support level. The Donchian Channel is a quintessential example of this strategy.

- **[Momentum Indicators](../m/momentum_indicators.md)**: These indicators measure the velocity of price movements. Popular ones include the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD).

## 2. Mean Reversion Strategies

**[Mean reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md)** strategies operate on the theory that asset prices will revert to their mean or average levels over time. This can apply to different financial metrics such as price, returns, or even fundamental ratios like P/E ratios.

- **Statistical [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**: Known as "stat-arb", this strategy identifies pricing inefficiencies between assets expected to revert to the mean. For instance, [pairs trading](../p/pairs_trading.md) involves identifying correlated pairs of stocks; when the prices deviate beyond historical norm, the strategy buys the undervalued stock and shorts the overvalued one.

## 3. Arbitrage Strategies

**[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)** involves taking advantage of price differentials in different markets or forms. It usually requires precise timing and rapid executionâ€”areas where algorithms excel.

- **Spatial [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**: This form involves exploiting price differentials in the same asset across different markets or exchanges. For example, Bitcoin might be sold at a higher price on one exchange and bought at a lower price on another.

- **Statistical [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**: While it often overlaps with [mean reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md) strategies, in statistical [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), algorithms look for statistical relationships among various securities, working on the assumption that prices will revert to the statistical mean.

## 4. Market Making Strategies

**Market making** involves providing liquidity to the market by offering buy and sell quotes simultaneously. Algorithmic market makers profit from the spread between the bid and ask prices. Market-making algorithms continuously adjust the quotes to maintain desired inventory levels and hedge risks.

## 5. Sentiment Analysis Based Strategies

**[Sentiment analysis](../s/sentiment_analysis.md)** strategies use natural language processing (NLP) and other machine learning techniques to gauge market sentiment from news, social media, and other sources.

- **News-Based Trading**: Algorithms scan news sources like Bloomberg or Reuters for market-moving news. If favorable, a buy order might be triggered; if unfavorable, a sell order might be issued.

- **[Social Media Analytics](../s/social_media_analytics.md)**: Algorithms scrape data from social media platforms like Twitter or stock forums to analyze public sentiment. Positive sentiment may trigger a buy, whereas negative sentiment may trigger a sell.

## 6. High-Frequency Trading (HFT)

**High-frequency trading** strategies operate at extremely high speeds, executing numerous orders per second. These strategies capitalize on small price discrepancies and usually involve co-location services to ensure minimal latency. HFT strategies can be complex, often incorporating elements from other [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) strategies but executed within millisecond timeframes.

## 7. Machine Learning and AI-Based Strategies

**Machine learning** and AI-based strategies utilize advanced statistical models and algorithms to predict future price movements. Machine learning models are trained on historical data and can include regressive models, deep learning architectures, reinforcement learning algorithms, and more.

- **Supervised Learning Models**: These models are trained on labeled historical data to predict future prices. Examples include [linear regression](../l/linear_regression.md), [decision trees](../d/decision_trees.md), and neural networks.

- **Unsupervised Learning Models**: These models look for hidden patterns in the data. [Clustering algorithms](../c/clustering_algorithms.md) such as K-means can identify related groups of assets or [price patterns](../p/price_patterns.md).

- **Reinforcement Learning**: In this framework, algorithms learn the best actions to take through trial and error, continually updating their strategy to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.

## 8. Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) Strategy

A **VWAP** strategy aims to execute orders around the Volume Weighted Average Price for a given period. VWAP is calculated by multiplying all sell transactions by their corresponding volumes and then dividing by the total volume. This strategy helps in minimizing the market impact and achieving closer to average prices.

## 9. Time Weighted Average Price (TWAP) Strategy

**TWAP** strategy is similar to VWAP but uses time-segmented data instead. Here, orders are spread evenly across a specific time period. TWAP strategies are useful for large orders that need execution over time to minimize market impact.

## 10. Implementation Shortfall Strategies

**Implementation shortfall** strategies aim to minimize the difference between the execution price and the decision price by breaking large orders into smaller chunks. These strategies consider market conditions and use a dynamic approach that adjusts the trading pace.

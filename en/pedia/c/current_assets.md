# Current Assets

## Introduction to Current Assets

Current assets represent all the assets of a company that are expected to be converted into cash, sold, or consumed within a year or within the company's operating cycle, whichever is longer. Examples of current assets include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventory, marketable securities, prepaid expenses, and other liquid assets.

## Importance of Current Assets

Current assets play a critical role in the liquidity and operational efficiency of a business. High levels of current assets can indicate a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations and operational needs. Conversely, a shortage in current assets can signal liquidity issues and potentially, financial distress.

### Liquidity Ratios

**Key Ratios:**
- **Current Ratio:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities. This ratio measures a company's ability to pay off its short-term liabilities with its short-term assets.
- **Quick Ratio:** (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities. This ratio provides a more stringent measure of liquidity, excluding less liquid forms of current assets like inventory.

### Working Capital Management

### Cash Conversion Cycle

**Definition:** The cash conversion cycle measures the time it takes for a company to convert its investments in inventory and other resources into cash.

**Formula:** Cash Conversion Cycle = Days Inventory Outstanding + Days Sales Outstanding - Days Payable Outstanding

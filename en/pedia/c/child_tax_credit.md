# Child Tax Credit

The Child [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md) (CTC) is a [tax benefit](../t/tax_benefit.md) provided by the U.S. federal government designed to help families with children. This [credit](../c/credit.md) aims to provide financial relief and support the cost of raising a family. The Child [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md) was originally established under the [Taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) Relief Act of 1997 and has undergone several modifications over the years to enhance benefits and adapt to changing socioeconomic conditions.

## Overview

The Child [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md) provides financial relief to taxpayers for each qualifying child under the age of 17 at the end of the tax year. The [credit](../c/credit.md) is designed to help [offset](../o/offset.md) the costs associated with raising children and ensure that families have the necessary resources to support their children's well-being and development.

## Eligibility Criteria

To qualify for the Child [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md), taxpayers must meet certain criteria, including:

- **Age Requirement**: The child must be under the age of 17 at the end of the tax year.
- **Relationship Test**: The child must be a son, daughter, stepchild, foster child, sibling, stepsibling, or a descendant of any of these individuals (e.g., a grandchild, niece, or nephew).
- **Residency Test**: The child must have lived with the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) for more than half of the tax year.
- **Support Test**: The child must not have provided more than half of their own support during the tax year.
- **Citizenship Test**: The child must be a U.S. citizen, U.S. national, or U.S. [resident alien](../r/resident_alien.md).

## Credit Amount

The amount of the Child [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md) can vary based on changes in legislation and the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md)'s [income](../i/income.md). As of recent legislation, the [credit](../c/credit.md) amounts and phaseout thresholds are as follows:

- **Base [Credit](../c/credit.md)**: The base [credit](../c/credit.md) amount is $2,000 per qualifying child.
- **Refundable Portion**: Up to $1,400 of the [credit](../c/credit.md) can be refundable, meaning taxpayers can receive this portion as a refund even if they owe no tax.
- **[Income](../i/income.md) Phaseout**: The [credit](../c/credit.md) begins to phase out for single filers with a modified adjusted [gross income](../g/gross_income.md) (MAGI) above $200,000 and for married couples filing jointly with a MAGI above $400,000.

## Recent Changes

The American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) of 2021 implemented significant temporary changes to the Child [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md) for the tax year 2021:

- **Expanded [Credit](../c/credit.md) Amount**: The [credit](../c/credit.md) amount was increased to $3,000 per child aged 6-17 and $3,600 per child under age 6.
- **Fully Refundable [Credit](../c/credit.md)**: For 2021, the [credit](../c/credit.md) was made fully refundable, allowing eligible families to receive the full [credit](../c/credit.md) amount even if they had no [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md).
- **Advance Payments**: Eligible families received advance monthly payments of the [credit](../c/credit.md) from July to December 2021, providing timely financial support.

## Claiming the Credit

Taxpayers can claim the Child [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md) by filing Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR and attaching Schedule 8812, which calculates the [credit](../c/credit.md) amount based on the number of qualifying children and the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md)'s [income](../i/income.md).

## Impact of the Child Tax Credit

The Child [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md) has a significant impact on reducing child [poverty](../p/poverty.md) and providing financial stability for families. Studies have shown that the [credit](../c/credit.md) helps to lower child [poverty](../p/poverty.md) rates by providing critical resources for families to meet their children's basic needs. The CTC also supports broader economic stability by allowing parents to allocate more of their [income](../i/income.md) to other essential expenses, such as housing, healthcare, and education.

## Future Outlook

As legislative discussions continue, there is ongoing debate about whether to extend or modify the expanded benefits introduced under the ARPA. Policymakers and advocates argue that maintaining the enhanced [credit](../c/credit.md) could have long-term positive effects on child [welfare](../w/welfare.md) and economic stability.

## Conclusion

The Child [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md) plays a crucial role in supporting families with children by reducing tax burdens and providing direct financial assistance. As legislative changes continue to shape the nature and [scope](../s/scope.md) of the [credit](../c/credit.md), it remains a vital tool for promoting the economic well-being of families and the general [welfare](../w/welfare.md) of children across the United States.

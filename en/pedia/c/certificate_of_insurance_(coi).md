Before allowing the subcontractor to start work, the construction company requests a Certificate of Insurance to verify that the subcontractor has adequate general liability and workers' compensation insurance. The subcontractor provides the COI, which details the coverage limits and effective dates, ensuring the construction company that any potential claims related to the subcontractor's work will be covered.

## How to Obtain a Certificate of Insurance

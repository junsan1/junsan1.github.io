# CUSIP Number

The Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures (CUSIP) number is an alphanumeric code assigned to all securities that are available for [trade](../t/trade.md) in the United States and Canada. This unique identifier is used to enhance the accuracy and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) of securities transactions by [offering](../o/offering.md) a standardized tracking mechanism.

## What is a CUSIP Number?

A CUSIP number consists of 9 characters, comprising a combination of letters and numbers. These characters are divided into three parts:
1. The first six characters (known as the “base” or “[issuer](../i/issuer.md) number”) identify the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) of the [security](../s/security.md) and are assigned alphabetically, from A to Z. Different classes of securities issued by the same company [will](../w/will.md) have the same first six characters.
2. The next two characters (usually, but not always, numeric) identify the [issue](../i/issue.md). This portion differentiates between the various securities issued by the same entity.
3. The final character is a [check](../c/check.md) digit used to validate the CUSIP number.

### Example of CUSIP Number Format
A CUSIP number might look something like this: `037833100`. Here, `037833` identifies the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) (Apple Inc.), `10` identifies the type of [security](../s/security.md) ([common stock](../c/common_stock.md)), and `0` is the [check](../c/check.md) digit.

## Historical Background

The CUSIP system was established in the U.S. in 1964 and has since become a mandatory aspect of securities identification. Initially developed to streamline back-office operations, CUSIP has grown to encompass all U.S. and Canadian registered [stocks](../s/stock.md), U.S. government and [municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md), [exchange](../e/exchange.md)-traded funds (ETFs), and mutual funds. The importance of standardized securities identification in modern [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) cannot be overstated, making CUSIP essential for various [market](../m/market.md) participants.

## Importance in Financial Markets

### Transparency and Efficiency
CUSIP numbers play a crucial role in improving the [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). By uniquely identifying each [security](../s/security.md), they help mitigate errors in transactions and facilitate the quick and accurate settlement of trades. This reliability is vital, especially in [automated trading systems](../a/automated_trading_systems.md) used in high-frequency trading and large-scale institutional investments.

### Regulatory Compliance
Regulatory bodies, such as the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) in the United States, require the use of CUSIP numbers for filing and monitoring purposes. These identifications ensure that the securities transactions are compliant with regulatory requirements and help regulatory bodies track ownership changes and [trade](../t/trade.md) activities.

### Risk Management
CUSIP numbers also facilitate [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) by allowing financial institutions to track and categorize their [asset](../a/asset.md) [holdings](../h/holdings.md) accurately. [Index](../i/index.md) compositions, portfolios, and [risk](../r/risk.md) assessments rely heavily on precise [security](../s/security.md) identification provided by CUSIP numbers.

## How to Obtain a CUSIP Number?

#### Applying for a CUSIP Number
To obtain a CUSIP number for a new [security](../s/security.md), an [issuer](../i/issuer.md) must complete an application process through Standard & Poor’s (S&P) CUSIP Global Services, the organization responsible for issuing CUSIP numbers. The process involves submitting detailed information about the [security](../s/security.md) and its [issuer](../i/issuer.md). For more detailed information, visit [CUSIP Global Services](https://www.cusip.com/).

#### Using a CUSIP Lookup Tool
Investors, brokers, and financial professionals can use online lookup tools to find the CUSIP numbers for existing securities. Various platforms provide search functionalities where one can enter a company’s name or other identifying information to retrieve the corresponding CUSIP number.

## Applications in Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), or “algotrading,” relies heavily on the [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and accuracy of data offered by CUSIP numbers. Here’s how:

### Data Integration
[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) systems integrate CUSIP numbers to precisely match securities with relevant [market](../m/market.md) data. This integration minimizes the [risk](../r/risk.md) of trading errors and enhances the reliability of [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) which rely on accurate real-time data.

### Trade Execution
In high-frequency trading, CUSIP numbers allow for the rapid identification and [execution](../e/execution.md) of trades. By eliminating ambiguity about which [security](../s/security.md) is being traded, CUSIP numbers ensure that trades are executed correctly, thereby maintaining [market](../m/market.md) integrity and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).

### Portfolio Management
Automated trading platforms utilize CUSIP numbers to manage portfolios and ensure that [asset](../a/asset.md) allocations are continuously updated and in line with investment strategies. Accurate identification of securities through their CUSIP numbers is crucial for [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) portfolios and executing trades in accordance with predefined investment rules.

### Compliance and Reporting
Automated systems also use CUSIP numbers to generate reports required by regulatory bodies. These reports assist in adhering to compliance requirements and provide a transparent history of all [trade](../t/trade.md) activities.

## Limitations and Challenges

### Inconsistent Use
While CUSIP numbers are widely used in the U.S. and Canada, their adoption is not global. This can lead to inconsistencies and challenges when dealing with international securities, necessitating the use of other international identification systems like ISIN (International Securities Identification Number).

### Potential for Misuse
CUSIP numbers are sometimes unofficially reused or misapplied to securities they weren't originally intended to describe. This misuse can create confusion and disrupt the integrity of [market](../m/market.md) transactions.

### Cost and Accessibility
There is a cost associated with obtaining CUSIP numbers which can be a barrier for smaller issuers. Additionally, access to comprehensive CUSIP databases often requires subscriptions, making it harder for smaller investors to access detailed securities information.

## Conclusion

The CUSIP number system is a backbone of the North American [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), providing a standardized method for identifying and tracking securities. Its applications in [trade](../t/trade.md) [execution](../e/execution.md), regulatory compliance, and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) are indispensable. While it has limitations, especially on the global stage, its importance in improving [market](../m/market.md) [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) is unparalleled. For organizations and individuals involved in securities trading, [investment management](../i/investment_management.md), or regulatory compliance, understanding and utilizing CUSIP numbers is essential for [operational efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md) and accuracy.

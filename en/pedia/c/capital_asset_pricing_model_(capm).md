# Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

The [Capital Asset](../c/capital_asset.md) Pricing Model (CAPM) is a foundational financial theory that establishes a relationship between the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) of an investment and its [risk](../r/risk.md) relative to the [market](../m/market.md). It was introduced by Jack Treynor, [William F. Sharpe](../w/william_f._sharpe.md), John Lintner, and Jan Mossin in the 1960s and has since become a central theme in modern portfolio theory and [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md).

## Key Components of CAPM

### Risk and Return

CAPM starts with the premise that investors need to be compensated in two ways: [time value](../t/time_value.md) of [money](../m/money.md) and [risk](../r/risk.md). The [time value](../t/time_value.md) of [money](../m/money.md) is represented by the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate, typically the [return](../r/return.md) on government bonds. The [risk](../r/risk.md), on the other hand, is measured by the [beta](../b/beta.md) (β) of the investment.

### The CAPM Formula

The basic formula of CAPM is:

\[ E(R_i) = R_f + \beta_i (E(R_m) - R_f) \]

Where:
- \( E(R_i) \) is the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) on the investment
- \( R_f \) is the [risk-free rate of return](../r/risk-free_rate_of_return.md)
- \( \beta_i \) is the [beta](../b/beta.md) of the investment
- \( E(R_m) \) is the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) of the [market](../m/market.md)
- \( E(R_m) - R_f \) is known as the [market risk premium](../m/market_risk_premium.md)

### Beta (β)

[Beta](../b/beta.md) measures the sensitivity of an investment's returns to the returns of the [market](../m/market.md). A [beta](../b/beta.md) of 1 implies that the investment's price [will](../w/will.md) move with the [market](../m/market.md). A [beta](../b/beta.md) less than 1 means that the investment is less volatile than the [market](../m/market.md), and a [beta](../b/beta.md) greater than 1 indicates higher [volatility](../v/volatility.md) than the [market](../m/market.md).

### Market Risk Premium

The [market risk premium](../m/market_risk_premium.md) represents the additional [return](../r/return.md) over the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate required by investors to compensate for the higher [risk](../r/risk.md) of [investing](../i/investing.md) in the [stock market](../s/stock_market.md). It is calculated as the difference between the expected [market](../m/market.md) [return](../r/return.md) and the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate.

## Assumptions of CAPM

CAPM is built on several key assumptions:
1. **Investors are Rational and [Risk-Averse](../r/risk-averse.md)**: Investors aim to maximize economic [utility](../u/utility.md) and, when faced with a choice between two investments with the same [return](../r/return.md), [will](../w/will.md) prefer the less risky one.
2. **Markets are Efficient**: All pertinent information about [stocks](../s/stock.md) is freely available and instantly absorbed by [market](../m/market.md) prices.
3. **Single Period [Transaction](../t/transaction.md) Horizon**: All investors plan for the same, single period [investment horizon](../i/investment_horizon.md).
4. **[Homogeneous Expectations](../h/homogeneous_expectations.md)**: All investors have the same expectations regarding [asset](../a/asset.md) returns, volatilities, and correlations.
5. **No [Taxes](../t/taxes.md) or [Transaction Costs](../t/transaction_costs.md)**: These factors do not affect investment decisions.
6. **Unlimited Borrowing and Lending at the [Risk](../r/risk.md)-Free Rate**: Investors can borrow and lend unlimited amounts at the [risk-free rate of return](../r/risk-free_rate_of_return.md).

## Applications of CAPM

### Portfolio Management

CAPM helps in constructing a balanced portfolio that aims to optimize returns for a given level of [risk](../r/risk.md). By predicting an investment's [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) considering its [systemic risk](../s/systemic_risk.md), CAPM enables portfolio managers to decide which assets to include in the portfolio.

### Corporate Finance

In [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md), CAPM is used in [capital budgeting](../c/capital_budgeting.md) to estimate a project's [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) and compare it with the cost of [financing](../f/financing.md). This helps in the decision-making process regarding which projects or investments the [firm](../f/firm.md) should undertake to maximize [shareholder value](../s/shareholder_value.md).

### Performance Evaluation

CAPM provides a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) for evaluating the performance of managed portfolios and individual securities. The realized [return](../r/return.md) of an investment can be compared to its CAPM-predicted [return](../r/return.md) to assess whether it performed better or worse than expected given its [risk](../r/risk.md) level.

## Criticisms and Limitations of CAPM

Despite its theoretical elegance and widespread use, CAPM has several limitations:
1. **Real-world Deviations**: The assumptions of CAPM, such as no [taxes](../t/taxes.md) or [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md) and all investors acting rationally, do not [hold](../h/hold.md) true in real markets.
2. **Estimation of Inputs**: Accurate estimation of [beta](../b/beta.md) and the [market risk premium](../m/market_risk_premium.md) is challenging, leading to potential inaccuracies in the model's predictions.
3. **Static Model**: CAPM is a single-period model, which does not account for changes in [risk](../r/risk.md) and returns over time.
4. **Empirical Evidence**: Some empirical studies have shown that the relationship between [beta](../b/beta.md) and [return](../r/return.md) is not as strong as CAPM predicts, indicating potential anomalies in the model.

## Extensions and Alternatives to CAPM

To address some of CAPM's limitations, various extensions and alternative models have been developed:

### Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT)

APT, developed by Stephen Ross in 1976, is a multifactor model that aims to overcome the limitations of CAPM by considering [multiple](../m/multiple.md) sources of [market risk](../m/market_risk.md) beyond just the [market portfolio](../m/market_portfolio.md). APT does not require a [market portfolio](../m/market_portfolio.md) and is based on the idea that [asset](../a/asset.md) returns can be predicted by a [linear relationship](../l/linear_relationship.md) with several macroeconomic factors.

### Fama-French Three-Factor Model

The Fama-French Three-[Factor](../f/factor.md) Model, proposed by Eugene F. Fama and Kenneth R. French, includes two additional factors to CAPM: size of firms (small vs. large) and book-to-[market value](../m/market_value.md) (high vs. low). This model recognizes that small-cap [stocks](../s/stock.md) and [stocks](../s/stock.md) with high book-to-[market](../m/market.md) ratios tend to [outperform](../o/outperform.md) the CAPM-predicted returns, adding further explanatory power to the model.

### Carhart Four-Factor Model

This model expands the Fama-French model by adding a [momentum factor](../m/momentum_factor.md), acknowledging that [stocks](../s/stock.md) with strong recent performance tend to continue performing well in the short term. The four factors in this model are [market risk](../m/market_risk.md), size, [value](../v/value.md), and [momentum](../m/momentum.md).

## Real-world Examples and Applications

### Investment Firms

Many investment firms use CAPM to guide their [asset management](../a/asset_management.md) strategies. For example, [Vanguard](https://www.vanguard.com/), a leading [investment management](../i/investment_management.md) company, employs CAPM to understand the [risk](../r/risk.md)-[return](../r/return.md) [trade](../t/trade.md)-off of various investment opportunities and to construct diversified portfolios aimed at achieving optimal returns.

### Financial Institutions

Banks and other financial institutions use CAPM for various purposes, including [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) and [asset](../a/asset.md)-[liability](../l/liability.md) management. By assessing the expected returns against their corresponding risks, these institutions can make informed decisions about lending, investment, and [capital allocation](../c/capital_allocation.md).

### Corporate Sector

Companies use CAPM in their [capital budgeting](../c/capital_budgeting.md) processes to evaluate investment projects. For instance, a [firm](../f/firm.md) like [General Electric](https://www.ge.com/) might use CAPM to estimate the required [return](../r/return.md) on a new project and compare it with its [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md), helping decide whether to proceed with the investment.

### Government Agencies

Regulatory bodies and government agencies may use CAPM to set benchmarks for acceptable returns on investments and regulatory assessments. For example, the [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)](https://www.sec.gov/) may refer to CAPM in evaluating the fairness of proposed returns in investment products.

## Conclusion

The [Capital Asset](../c/capital_asset.md) Pricing Model remains one of the most pivotal concepts in modern [finance](../f/finance.md) despite its limitations and criticisms. It provides a simple, yet powerful framework for understanding the [trade](../t/trade.md)-off between [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md), making it an invaluable tool for investors, portfolio managers, [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md) professionals, and regulators. As extensions and alternative models like APT and the Fama-French model continue to evolve, they build upon the foundational ideas of CAPM, enhancing our understanding of [asset](../a/asset.md) pricing in increasingly complex [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

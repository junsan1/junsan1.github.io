# Certificate of Deposit (CD)

A Certificate of [Deposit](../d/deposit.md) (CD) is a financial product commonly offered by banks and [credit](../c/credit.md) unions. It is a type of [savings account](../s/savings_account.md) that has a [fixed interest rate](../f/fixed_interest_rate.md) and fixed date of [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md), known as the [maturity date](../m/maturity_date.md). A CD is protected by [insurance](../i/insurance.md), either through the Federal [Deposit](../d/deposit.md) [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) (FDIC) for banks or the National [Credit](../c/credit.md) Union Administration (NCUA) for [credit](../c/credit.md) unions, up to the maximum allowed by law. 

## Key Characteristics of a Certificate of Deposit

### Fixed Term
A CD comes with a predetermined term, which can [range](../r/range.md) from a few weeks to several years. Common [maturity](../m/maturity.md) periods include three months, six months, one year, and five years. The term influences the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) and the earning potential.

### Fixed Interest Rate
The [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) on a CD is typically higher than that on regular savings accounts, but it remains fixed for the [duration](../d/duration.md) of the term. [Interest](../i/interest.md) can be compounded at different intervals, such as daily, monthly, or annually, depending on the institution [offering](../o/offering.md) the CD.

### Maturity Date
The [maturity date](../m/maturity_date.md) is the date when the CD term ends. At this point, the account holder can withdraw the initial investment plus the [accrued interest](../a/accrued_interest.md). Early withdrawals often incur penalties, which can vary based on the [bank](../b/bank.md)'s policy.

### Principal Protection
The [principal](../p/principal.md) amount invested in a CD is generally protected, meaning that account holders are guaranteed to get back their initial investment, along with [interest](../i/interest.md), provided they do not withdraw funds early.

### Insurance
CDs offered by banks are usually insured by the FDIC up to $250,000 per depositor, per insured [bank](../b/bank.md), for each account ownership category. CDs offered by [credit](../c/credit.md) unions are insured by the NCUA with the same coverage limits.

## Types of Certificates of Deposit

### Traditional CD
The traditional CD offers a [fixed interest rate](../f/fixed_interest_rate.md), fixed term, and a penalty for early [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md). 

### Bump-Up CD
A bump-up CD allows for a one-time increase in the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) during its term if the [bank](../b/bank.md)'s rates on comparable CDs rise. This feature can be beneficial if you expect [interest](../i/interest.md) rates to increase during the term of your CD.

### Step-Up CD
Step-up CDs start with a lower [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) that increases at specific intervals during the CD's term. The increase schedule and final [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) are determined at the outset.

### Liquid CD
A [liquid](../l/liquid.md) CD, sometimes called a no-penalty CD, allows you to withdraw part or all of your [deposit](../d/deposit.md) before the [maturity date](../m/maturity_date.md) without incurring a penalty. However, these CDs typically [offer](../o/offer.md) lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates than traditional CDs.

### Callable CD
Callable CDs can be "called in" or redeemed by the issuing [bank](../b/bank.md) before the [maturity date](../m/maturity_date.md). The [bank](../b/bank.md) would typically do this if [interest](../i/interest.md) rates fall, allowing them to reissue CDs at a lower rate. Callable CDs often [offer](../o/offer.md) higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates as a [trade](../t/trade.md)-off for this [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Zero-Coupon CD
Zero-coupon CDs are purchased at a [discount](../d/discount.md) to their [face value](../f/face_value.md) and don’t pay [interest](../i/interest.md) periodically. Instead, the [interest](../i/interest.md) compounds and is paid out in a lump sum at [maturity](../m/maturity.md).

### Jumbo CD
Jumbo CDs require a higher minimum [deposit](../d/deposit.md), typically $100,000 or more, and [offer](../o/offer.md) higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates than standard CDs. Because of the large [deposit](../d/deposit.md) required, these are usually favored by wealthy individuals and institutions.

## Advantages of Certificates of Deposit

### Low Risk
CDs are considered one of the safest investments since they [offer](../o/offer.md) fixed returns and are insured by the FDIC or NCUA.

### Higher Interest Rates
Compared to regular savings accounts, CDs generally [offer](../o/offer.md) higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, making them more attractive for those looking to maximize their savings without taking on significant [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Predictable Returns
The [fixed interest rate](../f/fixed_interest_rate.md) and term provide a predictable [return](../r/return.md), making [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md) easier, especially for retirees or those saving for a specific goal.

## Disadvantages of Certificates of Deposit

### Early Withdrawal Penalties
Withdrawing funds before the [maturity date](../m/maturity_date.md) incurs penalties, which can eat into or even exceed the [interest](../i/interest.md) earned, depending on terms and conditions.

### Inflation Risk
The [fixed interest rate](../f/fixed_interest_rate.md) may not keep pace with [inflation](../i/inflation.md), potentially reducing the [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) of the [money](../m/money.md) invested over time.

### Opportunity Cost
Funds locked into a CD are not [liquid](../l/liquid.md), meaning that they cannot be easily accessed or invested elsewhere without incurring penalties. This can be a disadvantage if more [lucrative](../l/lucrative.md) investment opportunities arise.

## How to Choose a Certificate of Deposit

### Shop Around
[Interest](../i/interest.md) rates on CDs can vary significantly between banks and [credit](../c/credit.md) unions, so it’s advisable to shop around and compare rates, terms, and any additional features.

### Consider the Term
Select a term that aligns with your financial goals and needs. Shorter terms [offer](../o/offer.md) more flexibility but generally lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, while longer terms [offer](../o/offer.md) higher rates but tie up your [money](../m/money.md) for a longer period.

### Check the Penalties
Understand the penalties for early [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md) before committing to a CD. Some institutions have more lenient policies than others.

### Monitor Interest Rate Trends
If you expect [interest](../i/interest.md) rates to rise, you might prefer a bump-up CD or a short-term CD that [will](../w/will.md) allow you to reinvest at higher rates sooner.

### Laddering Strategy
CD [laddering](../l/laddering.md) involves opening [multiple](../m/multiple.md) CDs with different [maturity](../m/maturity.md) dates. This strategy allows you to take advantage of higher rates on longer-term CDs while still maintaining access to some of your funds in the short term.

#### Example of a CD Ladder Strategy:
1. Invest equal amounts in 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, 4-year, and 5-year CDs.
2. As each CD matures, reinvest it into a new 5-year CD.
3. After five years, you [will](../w/will.md) have a CD maturing every year, providing regular access to your [money](../m/money.md) while earning higher rates on the long-term CDs.

## Where to Buy Certificates of Deposit

### Banks
Traditional banks are one of the most common places to buy CDs. They [offer](../o/offer.md) a variety of terms and types and typically require you to have a savings or [checking account](../c/checking_account.md) with them.

### Credit Unions
[Credit](../c/credit.md) unions also [offer](../o/offer.md) a wide [range](../r/range.md) of CDs. Membership is usually required, but they often provide competitive rates and better [customer service](../c/customer_service.md).

### Online Banks
Online banks tend to [offer](../o/offer.md) higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates on CDs because they have lower operating costs compared to brick-and-mortar institutions. Examples include Ally [Bank](../b/bank.md) (https://www.ally.com) and Marcus by Goldman Sachs (https://www.marcus.com).

### Brokerages
Some brokerage firms [offer](../o/offer.md) brokered CDs, which can come from different banks and [offer](../o/offer.md) a variety of terms and [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. These CDs might be callable and can involve a higher level of complexity. Examples include [Charles Schwab](../c/charles_schwab.md) (https://www.schwab.com) and Fidelity (https://www.fidelity.com).

## Final Thoughts

Certificates of [Deposit](../d/deposit.md) can be an effective tool for those looking to save [money](../m/money.md) with minimal [risk](../r/risk.md). They [offer](../o/offer.md) higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates than traditional savings accounts and come with the safety of FDIC or NCUA [insurance](../i/insurance.md). However, the [trade](../t/trade.md)-offs include limited [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and potential penalties for early [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md). By carefully selecting the term and type of CD that aligns with your financial goals, and possibly utilizing a strategy like CD [laddering](../l/laddering.md), you can maximize the benefits while minimizing the drawbacks of this financial product.

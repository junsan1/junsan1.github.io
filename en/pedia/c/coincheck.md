# Coincheck

## Overview
Coincheck is a prominent cryptocurrency [exchange](../e/exchange.md) and [digital wallet](../d/digital_wallet.md) service that operates primarily in Japan. Established in 2012, it has quickly risen to become one of the leading platforms for buying, selling, and storing cryptocurrencies.

## History
Coincheck was founded by Koichiro Wada and Yusuke Otsuka. The company is headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, and has made significant strides in the cryptocurrency [market](../m/market.md) since its inception. In 2018, Coincheck was acquired by Monex Group, a major Japanese financial services [firm](../f/firm.md). This [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) aimed to restore [trust](../t/trust.md) and improve the [security](../s/security.md) measures of Coincheck after the infamous NEM coin theft incident in January 2018.

## Services and Features

Coincheck provides a wide [range](../r/range.md) of cryptocurrencies for trading, including but not limited to [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) (BTC), [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) (ETH), [Ripple](../r/ripple.md) (XRP), Litecoin (LTC), and NEM (XEM). The platform supports various trading pairs and offers both spot and [margin trading](../m/margin_trading.md) [options](../o/options.md).

### Coincheck IEO (Initial Exchange Offering)
Coincheck has ventured into the IEO space, providing a platform for new [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) projects to raise funds by issuing tokens directly on the Coincheck [exchange](../e/exchange.md).

### Coincheck NFT Market

## Security Measures
After the NEM heist, Coincheck has implemented several enhanced [security](../s/security.md) measures. These include:

- **Cold Storage:** A significant portion of users' funds are stored in offline wallets to protect them from hacking attempts.
- **Multi-Signature Wallets:** [Multiple](../m/multiple.md) private keys are required to authorize transactions, reducing the [risk](../r/risk.md) of unauthorized access.
- **Two-[Factor](../f/factor.md) Authentication (2FA):** Adds an additional layer of [security](../s/security.md) for user accounts.

The APIs [offer](../o/offer.md) endpoints for retrieving [market](../m/market.md) data, placing and managing orders, and accessing account information. This feature is particularly useful for high-frequency traders and those utilizing advanced [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md).

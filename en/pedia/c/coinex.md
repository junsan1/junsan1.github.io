# CoinEx

CoinEx is a global cryptocurrency exchange that provides users with a diverse range of digital assets and services, designed to facilitate secure, efficient, and convenient trading experiences. Founded in December 2017 and headquartered in Hong Kong, CoinEx offers comprehensive trading services that include spot trading, margin trading, perpetual contracts, and various financial products. The exchange is known for its user-friendly interface, advanced security mechanisms, and commitment to regulatory compliance, making it a popular choice among both novice and experienced traders.

## History and Founders

CoinEx was founded by Haipo Yang, who is also the founder of ViaBTC, a well-known mining pool. Yang is a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency industry and has a background in developing distributed systems. His expertise has played a crucial role in shaping CoinEx into a robust and reliable platform.

The exchange was officially launched in December 2017 and quickly gained traction due to its user-centric features and comprehensive trading options. CoinEx has since expanded its operations globally, catering to millions of users across different countries and jurisdictions.

## Features and Services

### Spot Trading

CoinEx offers an extensive range of cryptocurrency pairs for spot trading, allowing users to trade popular digital assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and many others. The platform supports a wide variety of trading pairs, including both major and minor tokens, providing ample opportunities for diversified trading strategies.

### Margin Trading

For users looking to amplify their trading positions, CoinEx provides margin trading services with leverage options. This feature allows traders to borrow funds to increase their exposure to specific assets, potentially leading to higher returns. However, it also comes with increased risk, making risk management a crucial aspect of margin trading.

### Perpetual Contracts

CoinEx offers perpetual contracts, which are a type of derivative product that mimics the experience of trading in the spot market. These contracts do not have an expiration date, allowing traders to hold positions as long as desired. CoinEx's perpetual contracts support various cryptocurrencies and offer leverage, providing traders with more flexibility and opportunities for profit.

### Financial Products

In addition to traditional trading services, CoinEx provides a range of financial products designed to help users manage their assets and generate passive income. Some of these products include:

- **CoinEx Finance**: A suite of financial services including wealth management, lending, and staking.
- **Crypto Loans**: Users can borrow cryptocurrencies by using their digital assets as collateral, offering a way to access liquidity without selling their holdings.
- **Staking**: Users can participate in staking programs to earn rewards by locking their assets in supported blockchain networks.

### Security and Compliance

Security is a top priority for CoinEx, and the platform employs various measures to protect user funds and data. Some of these security features include:

## Fees and Pricing

CoinEx employs a transparent fee structure, making it easy for users to understand the costs associated with their trades. The platform uses a maker-taker fee model, where makers (those who provide liquidity) are charged lower fees compared to takers (those who take liquidity). The exact fee rates depend on the user's VIP level, which is determined by their trading volume and CET (CoinEx Token) holdings.

In addition to trading fees, CoinEx may charge withdrawal fees, which vary depending on the specific cryptocurrency. Users can also benefit from fee discounts by holding and using CET for fee payments.

## CoinEx Token (CET)

CET is the native utility token of the CoinEx ecosystem, serving various purposes within the platform. Launched in January 2018, CET offers several benefits to its holders, including:

- **Fee Discounts**: Users can use CET to pay for trading fees and receive discounts based on their CET holdings.
- **VIP Privileges**: CET holders can achieve VIP status, unlocking additional benefits such as lower fees, higher withdrawal limits, and exclusive promotions.
- **Staking and Rewards**: CET can be staked to earn rewards and participate in various promotional activities on the platform.
- **Voting Rights**: CET holders can participate in governance decisions, such as voting on new token listings and other platform-related proposals.

CET is an ERC-20 token initially issued on the Ethereum blockchain, but it has since migrated to CoinEx Chain, a decentralized public chain developed by CoinEx.

## CoinEx Chain

CoinEx Chain is a high-performance public blockchain launched by CoinEx to support decentralized applications (dApps) and the broader DeFi ecosystem. The chain consists of three specialized sub-chains:

- **DEX Chain**: Focuses on decentralized trading, providing a platform for users to trade digital assets in a decentralized and secure manner.

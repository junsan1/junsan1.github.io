# Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1)

Common [Equity](../e/equity.md) Tier 1 (CET1) [capital](../c/capital.md) is a core measure of a [bank](../b/bank.md)'s financial strength from a regulator's point of view. This term was introduced as a part of the [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md) regulatory framework, which is a set of international banking regulations developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The CET1 ratio measures a [bank](../b/bank.md)'s common [equity](../e/equity.md) [capital](../c/capital.md) against its [risk-weighted assets](../r/risk-weighted_assets.md) to ensure that banks have sufficient [capital](../c/capital.md) to absorb losses.

## What is CET1?

CET1 [capital](../c/capital.md) primarily consists of common [shares](../s/shares.md) and [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md). It represents the highest quality of regulatory [capital](../c/capital.md), as it is fully available to absorb losses. CET1 is calculated by summing up common [shares](../s/shares.md), stock [surplus](../s/surplus.md) (resulting from the [issue](../i/issue.md) of common instruments including [premium](../p/premium.md)), [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md), and [accumulated other comprehensive income](../a/accumulated_other_comprehensive_income.md) (AOCI). From this, certain intangible assets like [goodwill](../g/goodwill.md) and regulatory adjustments are deducted.

The CET1 ratio is calculated by dividing the CET1 [capital](../c/capital.md) by the [bank](../b/bank.md)'s total [risk-weighted assets](../r/risk-weighted_assets.md) (RWA). The formula looks like:

CET1 Ratio = (CET1 [Capital](../c/capital.md) / [Risk-Weighted Assets](../r/risk-weighted_assets.md)) * 100

[Risk-weighted assets](../r/risk-weighted_assets.md) are used to determine the minimum amount of [capital](../c/capital.md) that must be held by banks to reduce the [risk](../r/risk.md) of [insolvency](../i/insolvency.md). Various types of assets are [weighted](../w/weighted.md) based on their [risk](../r/risk.md), and the sum total is used in the calculation.

## Significance of CET1

- **Regulatory Requirement**: CET1 is used by regulators to determine a [bank](../b/bank.md)'s ability to sustain itself during [financial distress](../f/financial_distress.md). Under [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md), banks are required to maintain a minimum CET1 ratio of 4.5%. Banks are also subject to additional buffers like the [capital](../c/capital.md) conservation buffer (2.5%) and potentially a countercyclical buffer (up to 2.5%), bringing the total CET1 requirement up to 9.5%.

- **Financial Stability**: High CET1 ratios indicate that a [bank](../b/bank.md) is well-capitalized, which provides a cushion against financial losses and enhances long-term stability and confidence among investors and depositors.

- **[Market](../m/market.md) Confidence**: A higher CET1 ratio generally leads to increased confidence among stakeholders, including investors, borrowers, and regulators. It shows that the [bank](../b/bank.md) has a strong [equity](../e/equity.md) base to support its lending and investment activities.

## Components of CET1 Capital

### Common Equity
- **Common [Shares](../s/shares.md)**: These are the primary units of ownership in a [bank](../b/bank.md), providing investors with voting rights and entitling them to dividends.
- **Stock [Surplus](../s/surplus.md)**: This refers to any excess amount received by the [bank](../b/bank.md) over and above the [face value](../f/face_value.md) of the [shares](../s/shares.md) issued.

### Retained Earnings
- **Accumulated Profits**: These include profits that are retained in the [bank](../b/bank.md) and not distributed to shareholders as dividends.
- **Undistributed Profits**: These refer to profits that have not yet been allocated by the [bank](../b/bank.md) for any specific purpose.

### Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI)
- **Gains and Losses**: This includes accumulated gains and losses that are not part of the regular net [income](../i/income.md), such as [unrealized gains](../u/unrealized_gains.md)/losses on available-for-[sale](../s/sale.md) securities and foreign [currency](../c/currency.md) translation adjustments.

### Regulatory Adjustments
- **[Goodwill](../g/goodwill.md)**: Intangible assets like [goodwill](../g/goodwill.md) are deducted from CET1.
- **Deferred Tax Assets (DTAs)**: Some DTAs are also deducted based on regulatory guidelines.
- **[Minority Interest](../m/minority_interest.md)**: Certain minority interests in banking subsidiaries may also be included or excluded based on regulatory considerations.

## Calculation Example

To illustrate the computation of the CET1 ratio, consider a hypothetical [bank](../b/bank.md) with the following financials:

- Common [Shares](../s/shares.md): $50 million
- Stock [Surplus](../s/surplus.md): $20 million
- [Retained Earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md): $100 million
- AOCI: $10 million
- [Goodwill](../g/goodwill.md): $15 million
- [Risk-Weighted Assets](../r/risk-weighted_assets.md) (RWA): $700 million

First, calculate the CET1 [capital](../c/capital.md):

CET1 [Capital](../c/capital.md) = Common [Shares](../s/shares.md) + Stock [Surplus](../s/surplus.md) + [Retained Earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md) + AOCI - [Goodwill](../g/goodwill.md)

CET1 [Capital](../c/capital.md) = $50 million + $20 million + $100 million + $10 million - $15 million = $165 million

Now calculate the CET1 ratio:

CET1 Ratio = (CET1 [Capital](../c/capital.md) / [Risk-Weighted Assets](../r/risk-weighted_assets.md)) * 100

CET1 Ratio = ($165 million / $700 million) * 100 ≈ 23.57%

In this example, the [bank](../b/bank.md) has a CET1 ratio of approximately 23.57%, indicating strong [financial health](../f/financial_health.md).

## Basel III and CET1

[Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md), formulated by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, aims to strengthen regulation, supervision, and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) within the banking sector. One of the key elements of [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md) is the concept of CET1, which underscores the importance of high-quality [capital](../c/capital.md).

### Key Enhancements Under Basel III
- **Higher [Capital](../c/capital.md) Requirements**: [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md) increased the minimum regulatory [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements, mandating that banks [hold](../h/hold.md) a greater proportion of [equity](../e/equity.md) [capital](../c/capital.md).
- **[Capital](../c/capital.md) Buffers**: Introduced buffers like the [capital](../c/capital.md) conservation buffer and countercyclical buffer that banking institutions must [hold](../h/hold.md) in addition to the minimum CET1 requirement.
- **[Leverage Ratio](../l/leverage_ratio.md)**: Introduced a non-[risk](../r/risk.md)-based [leverage ratio](../l/leverage_ratio.md) to serve as a backstop measure against excessive borrowing.
- **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) Standards**: Introduced two [liquidity ratios](../l/liquidity_ratios.md) – the [Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) [Coverage Ratio](../c/coverage_ratio.md) (LCR) and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) to ensure banks have sufficient [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) during financial stress.

## How Banks Manage CET1

Banks employ various strategies to maintain or improve their CET1 ratios, ensuring adherence to regulatory requirements and financial stability.

### Capital Raising
- **Issuing New [Shares](../s/shares.md)**: Banks can [issue](../i/issue.md) new common [shares](../s/shares.md) to raise [capital](../c/capital.md). This can dilute existing shareholders' ownership but adds to the CET1 [capital](../c/capital.md).
- **[Retained Earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md)**: Banks can increase their [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md) by retaining a larger portion of their profits instead of paying them out as dividends.

### Risk Management
- **Reducing [Risk-Weighted Assets](../r/risk-weighted_assets.md)**: By re-allocating investments to lower-[risk](../r/risk.md) assets, banks can decrease their RWA, thereby improving the CET1 ratio.
- **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: Diversifying [asset](../a/asset.md) portfolios helps in spreading and potentially lowering [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Cost Management
- **Efficient Operations**: By optimizing [operational efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md), banks can reduce expenses and enhance profitability, contributing to higher [retained earnings](../r/retained_earnings.md).
- **[Asset](../a/asset.md) Sales**: Banks can sell non-core or underperforming assets to reduce RWAs and improve [capital](../c/capital.md) ratios.

# Corporate Bond

## Introduction
A corporate [bond](../b/bond.md) is a type of [debt security](../d/debt_security.md) that is issued by a [corporation](../c/corporation.md) and sold to investors. The backing for the [bond](../b/bond.md) is typically the [payment](../p/payment.md) ability of the company, which is usually [money](../m/money.md) to be earned from future operations. In some cases, the company's physical assets may be used as [collateral](../c/collateral.md) for bonds.

## Characteristics of Corporate Bonds

### Maturity Date
The [maturity date](../m/maturity_date.md) is the specific future date on which the [face value](../f/face_value.md) (or [principal](../p/principal.md)) of the [bond](../b/bond.md) must be repaid to the [bondholder](../b/bondholder.md). Corporate bonds typically carry maturities that [range](../r/range.md) from one year to 30 years. 

### Coupon Rate
The [coupon rate](../c/coupon_rate.md) is the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) the [bond](../b/bond.md) issuers [will](../w/will.md) pay to the [bondholder](../b/bondholder.md). It is usually presented as an annual percentage of the [face value](../f/face_value.md). For example, a [bond](../b/bond.md) with a [face value](../f/face_value.md) of $1,000 and a [coupon rate](../c/coupon_rate.md) of 5% [will](../w/will.md) pay $50 in [interest](../i/interest.md) annually.

### Credit Rating
[Credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) agencies such as Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s, and Fitch rate the [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) of corporate bonds. These ratings give investors insights into the [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with [investing](../i/investing.md) in a particular [bond](../b/bond.md). Higher-rated bonds ([AAA](../a/aaa.md), AA) are considered less risky, while lower-rated bonds (BBB and below) are considered higher [risk](../r/risk.md) (junk bonds).

### Call Provision
Some corporate bonds have a call [provision](../p/provision.md), allowing the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) to redeem the [bond](../b/bond.md) before its [maturity date](../m/maturity_date.md), typically at a [premium](../p/premium.md) to the [face value](../f/face_value.md). This can happen when [interest](../i/interest.md) rates fall significantly and the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) can reissue new [debt](../d/debt.md) at a more favorable rate.

### Convertible Bonds 
Convertible bonds provide the option to the holder to convert the [bond](../b/bond.md) into a predetermined number of [shares](../s/shares.md) of the issuing company’s stock. This feature allows bondholders to enjoy the [fixed income](../f/fixed_income.md) [security](../s/security.md) of a [bond](../b/bond.md) but also benefit from potential upward movements in the stock price.

## Types of Corporate Bonds

### Secured Bonds
Secured bonds are backed by specific [collateral](../c/collateral.md) to reduce the [risk](../r/risk.md) for investors. Examples include [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) bonds (backed by [real estate](../r/real_estate.md)) and equipment [trust](../t/trust.md) certificates (backed by equipment).

### Unsecured Bonds
Unsecured bonds, also known as debentures, are not backed by specific assets. Instead, they rely on the [issuer](../i/issuer.md)'s [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) and promise to pay [interest](../i/interest.md) and repay [principal](../p/principal.md).

### Floating Rate Bonds
Floating rate bonds have [interest](../i/interest.md) rates that adjust periodically according to a predetermined [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md), like the LIBOR or the Federal Reserve rate. This adjustment helps protect bondholders from inflationary trends.

### Fixed Rate Bonds
Fixed rate bonds have set [interest](../i/interest.md) rates which do not change throughout the life of the [bond](../b/bond.md), providing investors with certainty about the [payout](../p/payout.md).

## Investment Considerations

### Yield
The [yield](../y/yield.md) of a [bond](../b/bond.md) is the [return](../r/return.md) on investment and can be calculated in various ways, such as [current yield](../c/current_yield.md), [yield to maturity](../y/yield_to_maturity.md) (YTM), and [yield to call](../y/yield_to_call.md) (YTC).

### Price
The price of a corporate [bond](../b/bond.md) can fluctuate based on [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) changes, the [issuer](../i/issuer.md)’s [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md), [bond](../b/bond.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), and [market](../m/market.md) [demand](../d/demand.md). 

### Risk 
[Investing](../i/investing.md) in corporate bonds carries several risks, including [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) ([default risk](../d/default_risk.md)), [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md), and [liquidity risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md).

## Corporate Bond Market

### Primary Market
In the [primary market](../p/primary_market.md), corporations [issue](../i/issue.md) new bonds directly to investors through public offerings or private placements.

### Secondary Market
In the [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md), existing bonds are traded among investors. Trading typically occurs over-the-counter (OTC) but can also take place on exchanges.

## Role of Corporate Bonds in an Investment Portfolio

### Diversification
Including corporate bonds in an investment portfolio offers [diversification benefits](../d/diversification_benefits.md), as they often exhibit lower [volatility](../v/volatility.md) compared to [stocks](../s/stock.md) and can provide a steady [income](../i/income.md) stream.

### Income Generation
Corporate bonds are valuable for [income](../i/income.md)-focused investors. Their regular [interest](../i/interest.md) payments can be an essential source of [income](../i/income.md), particularly for retirees.

### Risk Management
Investors can manage portfolio [risk](../r/risk.md) by choosing bonds with varying maturities, [credit](../c/credit.md) ratings, and sectors, balancing higher-[risk](../r/risk.md), high-[yield](../y/yield.md) bonds with safer, investment-grade bonds.

## Conclusion
Corporate bonds are a crucial component of the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), providing companies a means to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) while [offering](../o/offering.md) investors the opportunity to earn [fixed income](../f/fixed_income.md). By understanding the characteristics, types, and risks associated with corporate bonds, investors can better navigate this segment of the financial [market](../m/market.md) and make informed investment decisions.

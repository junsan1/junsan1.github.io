# C Corporation

The C [Corporation](../c/corporation.md), or C Corp, is a type of legal structure for a [corporation](../c/corporation.md) in which the owners, or shareholders, are taxed separately from the entity. This is the most common form of [corporation](../c/corporation.md) in the United States and is used by small businesses and large corporations alike. It is distinct from other types of [business](../b/business.md) structures, such as sole proprietorships, partnerships, and S Corporations, each of which has different tax and legal implications.

## Formation and Structure

### Legal Formation
A C [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) is created by filing articles of [incorporation](../i/incorporation.md) with a state's corporate filing office. This document typically includes the [corporation](../c/corporation.md)’s name, purpose, [duration](../d/duration.md), incorporators, and stock structure. Once the articles of [incorporation](../i/incorporation.md) are filed and accepted, the [corporation](../c/corporation.md) is legally recognized as a separate entity.

### Governance Structure
The governance structure of a C [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) typically includes shareholders, who own the [corporation](../c/corporation.md), a board of directors, who oversee major decisions, and officers, who manage day-to-day operations. This structure provides a clear framework for management and accountability.

#### Shareholders
Shareholders invest [capital](../c/capital.md) in the [corporation](../c/corporation.md) and receive [shares](../s/shares.md) of stock representing their ownership [interest](../i/interest.md). They have the right to vote on major corporate decisions, such as electing directors and approving major mergers or [asset](../a/asset.md) sales.

#### Board of Directors
The board of directors is elected by the shareholders and is responsible for making significant [business](../b/business.md) decisions and overseeing the management of the [corporation](../c/corporation.md). They appoint officers and may form committees for specific oversight functions.

#### Officers
Officers include positions such as the CEO, CFO, and COO. They are responsible for the daily operations of the company and implementing the board's directives.

## Taxation

### Double Taxation
One of the key characteristics of a C [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) is that it faces [double taxation](../d/double_taxation.md). This means that the [corporation](../c/corporation.md) itself pays [taxes](../t/taxes.md) on its [income](../i/income.md) at the [corporate tax](../c/corporate_tax.md) rate. When profits are distributed to shareholders as dividends, those dividends are also taxed at the individual [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) level.

### Corporate Tax Rates
As of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, the federal [corporate tax](../c/corporate_tax.md) rate in the United States is 21%. However, corporations may also be subject to state and local [taxes](../t/taxes.md).

### Deductions and Credits
C Corporations can take advantage of various tax deductions and credits that are not available to other [business](../b/business.md) structures. This includes deductions for [business](../b/business.md) expenses, which can lower [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md), and credits for activities such as research and development.

## Legal Liability

### Limited Liability
One of the main advantages of a C [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) is [limited liability](../l/limited_liability.md) protection. Shareholders are not personally liable for the [corporation](../c/corporation.md)’s debts and [obligations](../o/obligation.md). This means that if the [corporation](../c/corporation.md) is sued or incurs [debt](../d/debt.md), the personal assets of the shareholders are generally protected.

### Perpetual Existence
A C [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) has perpetual existence, meaning it continues to exist even if the ownership changes or the original founders leave the [corporation](../c/corporation.md). This is in contrast to sole proprietorships and partnerships, which can be dissolved upon the departure or death of an owner.

## Raising Capital

### Issuing Stock
C Corporations have the ability to [issue](../i/issue.md) [multiple](../m/multiple.md) classes of stock, which can include common and [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md). This flexibility makes it easier to attract investors, as different classes of stock can [offer](../o/offer.md) different rights and privileges.

### Venture Capital and Public Offerings
C Corporations are often preferred by [venture capital](../v/venture_capital.md) firms because their structure allows for easier exit strategies, such as initial public offerings (IPOs). [Going public](../g/going_public.md) provides a significant opportunity to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) by selling [shares](../s/shares.md) to the public through the [stock market](../s/stock_market.md).

## Compliance Requirements

### Reporting and Disclosure
C Corporations are subject to more rigorous reporting and [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) requirements than other [business](../b/business.md) types. This includes filing annual reports, holding annual [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) meetings, and maintaining detailed financial records.

### Regulatory Standards
In addition to state corporate laws, C Corporations must comply with federal securities laws if they are publicly traded. This includes regulations enforced by the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC).

## Comparison with Other Entities

### S Corporation
Unlike a C [Corporation](../c/corporation.md), an S [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) is a pass-through entity, meaning that its [income](../i/income.md) is passed through to the shareholders and taxed at their individual tax rates. However, S Corporations face restrictions on the number and type of shareholders they can have, as well as on the classes of stock they can [issue](../i/issue.md).

### LLC
A [Limited Liability](../l/limited_liability.md) Company (LLC) offers similar [liability](../l/liability.md) protection to a C [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) but is usually taxed as a pass-through entity. An LLC provides more flexibility in terms of management and [profit distribution](../p/profit_distribution.md), but may not be as attractive to investors as a C [Corporation](../c/corporation.md).

## Examples of Prominent C Corporations

### Apple Inc.
Apple Inc. is an example of a highly successful C [Corporation](../c/corporation.md). The company has significantly benefited from the ability to raise large amounts of [capital](../c/capital.md) through public stock offerings and has leveraged this [capital](../c/capital.md) to drive innovation and growth.

A C [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) is a versatile and widely-used [business](../b/business.md) structure in the United States. It offers significant advantages in terms of [limited liability](../l/limited_liability.md), perpetual existence, and the ability to raise [capital](../c/capital.md). However, it also comes with complexities related to [double taxation](../d/double_taxation.md) and regulatory compliance. Understanding these factors is crucial for entrepreneurs and investors when choosing the appropriate legal structure for their [business](../b/business.md).

# Commodity Futures

[Commodity](../c/commodity.md) [futures](../f/futures.md) are standardized contracts to buy or sell a specific [commodity](../c/commodity.md) at a predetermined price at a specific time in the future. These financial instruments are commonly traded on exchanges and are used by various [market](../m/market.md) participants including producers, consumers, and speculators to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against price [risk](../r/risk.md) or to [profit](../p/profit.md) from price changes.

## Key Concepts in Commodity Futures

### Commodity Types
Commodities are broadly classified into four main categories:

1. **Agricultural**: Includes wheat, corn, soybeans, coffee, and cotton.
2. **Energy**: Includes [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md), natural gas, gasoline, and heating oil.
3. **Metals**: Includes precious metals like gold and silver, as well as base metals like copper and aluminum.
4. **Livestock and Meat**: Includes cattle, hogs, and pork bellies.

### Futures Contracts
A [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) obligates the holder to buy or sell the [asset](../a/asset.md) at a specified price and date. These contracts are standardized in terms of quality, quantity, and delivery time and are traded on [futures](../f/futures.md) exchanges.

### Hedging and Speculation
- **Hedging**: Producers and consumers of commodities use [futures](../f/futures.md) to lock in prices and manage their exposure to price [volatility](../v/volatility.md). For instance, a farmer can sell a [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) to lock in the price of their crop months before harvesting.
- **[Speculation](../s/speculation.md)**: Traders aim to [profit](../p/profit.md) from price movements. They do not intend to take delivery of the [commodity](../c/commodity.md); instead, they close their positions before the contract's expiration.

### Margin Requirements
Trading [futures](../f/futures.md) involves significant [leverage](../l/leverage.md). [Market](../m/market.md) participants must put up a [margin](../m/margin.md), a fraction of the contract's [value](../v/value.md), to [open](../o/open.md) a position. The [margin account](../m/margin_account.md) is adjusted daily to reflect gains and losses.

### Settlement Types
[Futures](../f/futures.md) can be settled in two ways:
- **[Physical Delivery](../p/physical_delivery_in_trading.md)**: The physical [commodity](../c/commodity.md) is delivered upon contract expiration.
- **Cash Settlement**: The difference between the contract price and the [market price](../m/market_price.md) is settled in cash.

## Major Commodity Exchanges
[Commodity](../c/commodity.md) [futures](../f/futures.md) are traded on various exchanges around the world. Some of the largest include:

### Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)
The CME Group (https://www.cmegroup.com/) offers [futures](../f/futures.md) and [options](../o/options.md) on a wide [range](../r/range.md) of [asset](../a/asset.md) classes including agricultural commodities, energy, and metals.

### Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)
The ICE (https://www.theice.com/) operates global [futures](../f/futures.md) and [options](../o/options.md) markets and offers trading in commodities such as [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md), natural gas, and softs like coffee and cocoa.

### London Metal Exchange (LME)
The LME (https://www.lme.com/) specializes in trading base metals [futures](../f/futures.md) such as copper, aluminum, and zinc.

## Pricing of Futures Contracts
The price of a [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) is influenced by several factors including:

### Spot Price
The current [market price](../m/market_price.md) of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [commodity](../c/commodity.md).

### Cost of Carry
This includes storage costs, [insurance](../i/insurance.md), and [financing](../f/financing.md) costs. The [futures](../f/futures.md) price tends to be higher than the [spot price](../s/spot_price.md) to account for these expenses.

### Interest Rates
Higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates increase the cost of carry, thereby raising [futures](../f/futures.md) prices.

### Supply and Demand
[Market](../m/market.md) expectations about future [supply](../s/supply.md) and [demand](../d/demand.md) dynamics significantly influence [futures](../f/futures.md) prices.

### Weather and Geopolitical Events
Events such as droughts, natural disasters, and political instability in key producing regions can cause significant price [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

## Strategies in Commodity Futures Trading

### Spread Trading
Involves taking positions in two different [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) to [profit](../p/profit.md) from changes in the price spread between them. Common types include calendar [spreads](../s/spreads.md) and inter-[commodity](../c/commodity.md) [spreads](../s/spreads.md).

### Trend Following
Traders use [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) to identify and follow existing price trends. This strategy assumes that prices [will](../w/will.md) continue in their current direction.

### Mean Reversion
This strategy is based on the idea that [commodity](../c/commodity.md) prices [will](../w/will.md) revert to their historical average over time. Traders look for prices that have deviated significantly from this average.

### Algorithmic Trading
Utilizes computer algorithms to execute trades based on predefined criteria. This can include high-frequency trading, where algorithms execute a large number of orders at very fast speeds.

### Arbitrage
Involves exploiting price differentials between markets or related instruments. For example, a [trader](../t/trader.md) might simultaneously buy and sell the same [commodity](../c/commodity.md) in different markets to [profit](../p/profit.md) from price discrepancies.

## Risks in Commodity Futures

### Price Volatility
[Commodity](../c/commodity.md) prices can be extremely volatile, influenced by numerous factors including weather, [geopolitical events](../g/geopolitical_events.md), and changes in [supply](../s/supply.md) and [demand](../d/demand.md).

### Leverage
While [leverage](../l/leverage.md) can amplify gains, it also magnifies losses. Traders can lose more than their [initial margin](../i/initial_margin.md) in highly leveraged positions.

### Liquidity Risk
Some [commodity](../c/commodity.md) [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) may have low trading [volume](../v/volume.md), making it difficult to enter or exit positions without significantly impacting the price.

### Counterparty Risk
Although [futures](../f/futures.md) exchanges mitigate [counterparty risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md) through [margin](../m/margin.md) requirements and daily settlements, there is still a residual [risk](../r/risk.md) if a party defaults.

## Regulatory Environment
[Commodity](../c/commodity.md) [futures](../f/futures.md) trading is heavily regulated to ensure [market](../m/market.md) integrity and protect participants from [fraud](../f/fraud.md) and manipulation. Key regulatory bodies include:

### Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)
The CFTC (https://www.cftc.gov/) oversees the U.S. [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) markets, including [futures](../f/futures.md), to ensure they operate in a fair, transparent, and sound manner.

### National Futures Association (NFA)
The NFA (https://www.nfa.[futures](../f/futures.md).org/) is a self-regulatory organization for the U.S. [futures](../f/futures.md) [industry](../i/industry.md), providing regulatory programs and services to ensure [market](../m/market.md) integrity.

### European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA)
ESMA (https://www.esma.europa.eu/) regulates [futures](../f/futures.md) and [options](../o/options.md) markets in the [European Union](../e/european_union_(eu).md), ensuring [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and protecting investors.

## Conclusion
[Commodity](../c/commodity.md) [futures](../f/futures.md) play a crucial role in global [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), [offering](../o/offering.md) a mechanism for [price discovery](../p/price_discovery.md), [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), and speculative opportunities. Understanding the intricate dynamics of these instruments, including the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) commodities, contract specifications, [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), and regulatory landscape, is essential for anyone participating in these markets.

# Collateralized Mortgage Obligation (CMO)

A Collateralized [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) Obligation (CMO) is a type of [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-backed [security](../s/security.md) (MBS) that pools together a collection of mortgages and pays an [interest](../i/interest.md) to investors from the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) payments homeowners make on the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) loans. CMOs were developed in the 1980s as a means for financial institutions to create more [liquid](../l/liquid.md) and versatile investment vehicles from the illiquid pool of residential mortgages.

## Structure of CMOs

CMOs divide the pool of [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) loans into distinct classes known as [tranches](../t/tranches.md) (slices), each with its own [risk](../r/risk.md) profile, expected [maturity](../m/maturity.md), and [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md). The [tranches](../t/tranches.md) are structured to redirect the cash flows from the mortgages to different classes of investors, based on their priority for receiving payments from the entire [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) pool.

### Types of Tranches

1. **Sequential Pay [Tranches](../t/tranches.md)**: In this structure, each tranche receives [principal](../p/principal.md) payments in a strict sequence. The first tranche receives all [principal](../p/principal.md) repayments until it is entirely paid off, followed by the next tranche, and so on. [Interest](../i/interest.md) payments, however, are distributed proportionately.

2. **Planned Amortization Class (PAC) [Tranches](../t/tranches.md)**: These [tranches](../t/tranches.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) more predictable cash flows. Planned [principal](../p/principal.md) payments are structured according to a schedule, providing a degree of insulation from [prepayment risk](../p/prepayment_risk.md). PAC [tranches](../t/tranches.md) typically have companion [tranches](../t/tranches.md) that absorb the [variability](../v/variability.md) in prepayments.

3. **Support or Companion [Tranches](../t/tranches.md)**: These [tranches](../t/tranches.md) absorb the excess or [shortfall](../s/shortfall.md) in [principal](../p/principal.md) payments that deviate from the planned schedule. As such, they carry higher returns but also higher [risk](../r/risk.md).

4. **Accrual or Z [Tranches](../t/tranches.md)**: These [tranches](../t/tranches.md) do not receive [interest](../i/interest.md) payments initially. Instead, the [interest](../i/interest.md) they are supposed to earn is added to the [principal](../p/principal.md) balance. This structure results in a larger [payment](../p/payment.md) sum when the tranche matures.

5. **Inverse Floater [Tranches](../t/tranches.md)**: The [interest](../i/interest.md) rates on these [tranches](../t/tranches.md) fluctuate inversely to a specific [index](../i/index_instrument.md) rate, such as the LIBOR. They are typically used by investors looking to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against falling [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

## Risks Associated with CMOs

1. **[Prepayment Risk](../p/prepayment_risk.md)**: Homeowners have the option to prepay their [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) loans, often when [interest](../i/interest.md) rates decline. This leads to early repayments, which might cause the CMO to pay back its [principal](../p/principal.md) sooner than anticipated.

2. **Extension [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: Conversely, extension [risk](../r/risk.md) occurs when [interest](../i/interest.md) rates rise, and homeowners slow down their prepayments. This would extend the [maturity](../m/maturity.md) of the CMOs, potentially resulting in lower returns.

3. **[Credit Risk](../c/credit_risk.md)**: This involves the [risk](../r/risk.md) of homeowners defaulting on their loans, which can affect the [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) and [yield](../y/yield.md) of a CMO.

4. **[Liquidity Risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md)**: CMOs can become difficult to [trade](../t/trade.md) in times of [market](../m/market.md) stress. This would affect their [market price](../m/market_price.md) and the ability to sell them quickly.

## Importance in Finance

CMOs play a crucial role in the financial [market](../m/market.md) by allowing [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) lenders to transform illiquid [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) assets into more [liquid](../l/liquid.md) securities. This process increases the availability of funds for further lending, thereby promoting homeownership and investment opportunities. CMOs also provide investors with diversifiable [risk profiles](../r/risk_profiles.md) and [income](../i/income.md) streams tailored to specific preferences.

## Criticism and the Financial Crisis of 2008

CMOs were heavily criticized following the [subprime mortgage](../s/subprime_mortgage.md) crisis leading to the global [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) of 2007-2008. Many CMOs included high-[risk](../r/risk.md) subprime mortgages, and as more homeowners defaulted on their payments, the [value](../v/value.md) of CMOs plummeted. Investors, believing they were relatively safe investments, suffered substantial losses. The complexity and opacity of CMO structures further contributed to [systemic risk](../s/systemic_risk.md), eroding [investor](../i/investor.md) confidence in [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-backed securities and leading to widespread financial contagion.

## Companies Involved in CMOs

Many prominent financial institutions partake in the [origination](../o/origination.md), structuring, and management of CMOs, including:

1. **[Freddie Mac](../f/freddie_mac.md)**: [Freddie Mac CMOs](https://www.freddiemac.com)

2. **Fannie Mae**: [Fannie Mae CMOs](https://www.fanniemae.com/)

3. **Ginnie Mae**: [Ginnie Mae CMOs](https://www.ginniemae.gov/)

### Freddie Mac

[Freddie Mac](../f/freddie_mac.md) (Federal [Home](../h/home.md) [Loan](../l/loan.md) [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [Corporation](../c/corporation.md)) plays a pivotal role in the secondary [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [market](../m/market.md) by purchasing mortgages from lenders and bundling them into CMOs and other MBS. It provides essential [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), stability, and affordability to the housing [market](../m/market.md).

### Fannie Mae

Fannie Mae (Federal National [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) Association) also enhances the [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) in the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [market](../m/market.md) by buying mortgages from lenders. Fannie Mae issues MBS and CMOs tailored to meet the needs of investors in the [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md), thereby supporting [home](../h/home.md) [financing](../f/financing.md) across the nation.

### Ginnie Mae

Ginnie Mae (Government National [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) Association) guarantees the timely [payment](../p/payment.md) of [principal](../p/principal.md) and [interest](../i/interest.md) on MBS. Its backing by the U.S. government ensures high [credit](../c/credit.md) quality, making these securities attractive to a worldwide [investor](../i/investor.md) base.

## Conclusion

The Collateralized [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) Obligation (CMO) represents a fundamental innovation in the [finance](../f/finance.md) [industry](../i/industry.md), providing a versatile and sophisticated investment avenue. Despite its benefits, CMOs carry inherent risks that must be prudently managed to ensure they contribute positively to the stability and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) of the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md). Understanding the structure, risks, and roles of key institutions involving CMOs is crucial for any [market](../m/market.md) participant engaged in [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-backed securities.

# Capitalization Table

A Capitalization Table, commonly referred to as a Cap Table, is an essential spreadsheet or document used by startups, investment firms, and other organizations to understand the ownership stakes in the company as it grows and evolves. It serves as a clear, concise way to display the equity ownership capital structure of a company, detailing who owns what percentage of the companyâ€™s shares. This information is vital for internal stakeholders, potential investors, and financial analysts.

**Components of a Capitalization Table**

A comprehensive Cap Table typically includes:

1. **Shareholders**: The individuals or entities that own shares in the company. This could include founders, employees, investors, advisors, and others.
2. **Types of Shares**: Detail on the different classes of shares, such as common stock and preferred stock, including the terms associated with each type.
3. **Number of Shares Owned**: The exact number of shares each shareholder owns.
4. **Percentage Ownership**: The percentage of the company owned by each shareholder, calculated based on the total number of outstanding shares.
5. **Dilution**: Information on how issuing new shares could affect the ownership percentage of current shareholders.
6. **Options and Warrants**: Details about stock options and warrants, which can influence the total number of shares outstanding.

**Importance of a Cap Table**

1. **Decision Making**: Helps company executives make informed decisions about financing, compensation, and other critical aspects.
2. **Fundraising**: Essential during fundraising rounds as it provides potential investors with a clear picture of the company's equity structure.
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensures that the company complies with regulations by keeping accurate records of share issuance and ownership.
4. **Valuation**: Assists in determining the company's valuation at various stages by providing a clear snapshot of ownership patterns.

**Types of Shares in a Cap Table**

1. **Common Shares**: Typically owned by founders, employees, and early investors. These shares generally carry voting rights but are last in line in terms of claim on assets in case of liquidation.
2. **Preferred Shares**: Often held by venture capitalists and other external investors. These shares come with specific terms, preferences in liquidation, and sometimes dividends.

**Cap Table Management**

Managing a Cap Table can become complex as the number of shareholders increases and the company grows. Proper management involves:

1. **Software Tools**: Leveraging specialized software tools like [Carta](https://carta.com), [Capshare](https://capshare.com), or [Gust](https://www.gust.com) can simplify the process of Cap Table management.
2. **Regular Updates**: Ensuring the Cap Table is regularly updated to reflect any changes such as issuing new shares, transferring shares, or exercising options.
3. **Professional Assistance**: Seeking assistance from financial advisors or legal professionals to maintain accuracy and compliance.

**Excel Cap Table Example**

Here's an example of a simple Cap Table in Excel format:

| Shareholder Name | Type of Share | Number of Shares | % Ownership |
|------------------|---------------|------------------|-------------|
| Founder 1        | Common        | 1,000,000        | 50%         |
| Founder 2        | Common        | 1,000,000        | 50%         |
| Investor A       | Preferred     | 500,000          | 25%         |
| Employee Pool    | Option Pool   | 200,000          | 10%         |

### Key Events Impacting the Cap Table

Certain business events have significant impacts on the Cap Table:

1. **Seed Rounds**: Early-stage investment rounds where angel investors or seed funds provide capital in exchange for equity.
2. **Series A, B, C Rounds**: Subsequent rounds of financing where venture capitalists invest larger sums for equity.
3. **Exercise of Options**: When employees exercise stock options, converting them into shares, leading to dilution of ownership percentage.
4. **Conversions**: Convertible notes and adjustable equity that change into preferred or common shares upon triggering events.
5. **Stock Splits**: Event where each share is divided into multiple shares, thus increasing the total number of shares outstanding without changing the company's market value.

### Dilution

Dilution occurs when a company issues new shares, thereby reducing the ownership percentage of existing shareholders. This is often a concern when new investment rounds are completed. Understanding the impact of dilution is crucial for stakeholders, and the Cap Table can clearly depict pre- and post-dilution ownership percentages.

### Real-World Example: A Hypothetical Scenario

Assume a company, Tech Innovators Inc., is planning to raise a Series A round of $5 million at a pre-money valuation of $20 million. Before the Series A, the Cap Table is as follows:

#### Pre-Money Cap Table:

| Shareholder      | Number of Shares | % Ownership |
|------------------|------------------|-------------|
| Founder A        | 2,000,000        | 50%         |
| Founder B        | 1,000,000        | 25%         |
| Employee Stock Options | 500,000    | 12.5%       |
| Angel Investors  | 500,000          | 12.5%       |
| **Total**        | **4,000,000**    | **100%**    |

Upon completion of the Series A round:

1. **New Investment**: $5 million
2. **Pre-money Valuation**: $20 million
3. **Post-money Valuation**: $25 million

#### Post-Money Cap Table:

| Shareholder      | Number of Shares | % Ownership |
|------------------|------------------|-------------|
| Founder A        | 2,000,000        | 40%         |
| Founder B        | 1,000,000        | 20%         |
| Employee Stock Options | 500,000    | 10%         |
| Angel Investors  | 500,000          | 10%         |
| Series A Investors | 1,250,000      | 20%         |
| **Total**        | **5,000,000**    | **100%**    |

The Series A investors now own 20% of the company post-financing, while the existing shareholders' percentages have been diluted accordingly.

# Capitalization Table

A [Capitalization](../c/capitalization.md) Table, commonly referred to as a Cap Table, is an essential spreadsheet or document used by startups, investment firms, and other organizations to understand the ownership stakes in the company as it grows and evolves. It serves as a clear, concise way to display the [equity](../e/equity.md) ownership [capital structure](../c/capital_structure.md) of a company, detailing who owns what percentage of the companyâ€™s [shares](../s/shares.md). This information is vital for internal stakeholders, potential investors, and financial analysts.

**Components of a [Capitalization](../c/capitalization.md) Table**

A comprehensive Cap Table typically includes:

1. **Shareholders**: The individuals or entities that own [shares](../s/shares.md) in the company. This could include founders, employees, investors, advisors, and others.
2. **Types of [Shares](../s/shares.md)**: Detail on the different classes of [shares](../s/shares.md), such as [common stock](../c/common_stock.md) and [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md), including the terms associated with each type.
3. **Number of [Shares](../s/shares.md) Owned**: The exact number of [shares](../s/shares.md) each [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) owns.
4. **Percentage Ownership**: The percentage of the company owned by each [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md), calculated based on the total number of outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md).
5. **[Dilution](../d/dilution.md)**: Information on how issuing new [shares](../s/shares.md) could affect the ownership percentage of current shareholders.
6. **[Options](../o/options.md) and [Warrants](../w/warrants_in_trading.md)**: Details about stock [options](../o/options.md) and [warrants](../w/warrants_in_trading.md), which can influence the total number of [shares](../s/shares.md) outstanding.

**Importance of a Cap Table**

1. **Decision Making**: Helps company executives make informed decisions about [financing](../f/financing.md), compensation, and other critical aspects.
2. **Fundraising**: Essential during fundraising rounds as it provides potential investors with a clear picture of the company's [equity](../e/equity.md) structure.
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensures that the company complies with regulations by keeping accurate records of share issuance and ownership.
4. **[Valuation](../v/valuation.md)**: Assists in determining the company's [valuation](../v/valuation.md) at various stages by providing a clear snapshot of ownership patterns.

**Types of [Shares](../s/shares.md) in a Cap Table**

1. **Common [Shares](../s/shares.md)**: Typically owned by founders, employees, and early investors. These [shares](../s/shares.md) generally carry voting rights but are last in line in terms of claim on assets in case of [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md).
2. **Preferred [Shares](../s/shares.md)**: Often held by venture capitalists and other external investors. These [shares](../s/shares.md) come with specific terms, preferences in [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md), and sometimes dividends.

**Cap Table Management**

Managing a Cap Table can become complex as the number of shareholders increases and the company grows. Proper management involves:

1. **[Software Tools](../s/software_tools_for_trading.md)**: Leveraging specialized [software tools](../s/software_tools_for_trading.md) like [Carta](https://carta.com), [Capshare](https://capshare.com), or [Gust](https://www.gust.com) can simplify the process of Cap Table management.
2. **Regular Updates**: Ensuring the Cap Table is regularly updated to reflect any changes such as issuing new [shares](../s/shares.md), transferring [shares](../s/shares.md), or exercising [options](../o/options.md).
3. **Professional Assistance**: Seeking assistance from financial advisors or legal professionals to maintain accuracy and compliance.

**Excel Cap Table Example**

Here's an example of a simple Cap Table in Excel format:

| [Shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) Name | Type of Share | Number of [Shares](../s/shares.md) | % Ownership |
|------------------|---------------|------------------|-------------|
| Founder 1        | Common        | 1,000,000        | 50%         |
| Founder 2        | Common        | 1,000,000        | 50%         |
| [Investor](../i/investor.md) A       | Preferred     | 500,000          | 25%         |
| Employee Pool    | [Option Pool](../o/option_pool.md)   | 200,000          | 10%         |

### Key Events Impacting the Cap Table

Certain [business](../b/business.md) events have significant impacts on the Cap Table:

1. **Seed Rounds**: Early-stage investment rounds where angel investors or seed funds provide [capital](../c/capital.md) in [exchange](../e/exchange.md) for [equity](../e/equity.md).
2. **Series A, B, C Rounds**: Subsequent rounds of [financing](../f/financing.md) where venture capitalists invest larger sums for [equity](../e/equity.md).
3. **[Exercise](../e/exercise.md) of [Options](../o/options.md)**: When employees [exercise](../e/exercise.md) stock [options](../o/options.md), converting them into [shares](../s/shares.md), leading to [dilution](../d/dilution.md) of ownership percentage.
4. **Conversions**: Convertible notes and adjustable [equity](../e/equity.md) that change into preferred or common [shares](../s/shares.md) upon triggering events.
5. **Stock Splits**: Event where each share is divided into [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [shares](../s/shares.md), thus increasing the total number of [shares](../s/shares.md) outstanding without changing the company's [market value](../m/market_value.md).

### Dilution

[Dilution](../d/dilution.md) occurs when a company issues new [shares](../s/shares.md), thereby reducing the ownership percentage of existing shareholders. This is often a concern when new investment rounds are completed. Understanding the impact of [dilution](../d/dilution.md) is crucial for stakeholders, and the Cap Table can clearly depict pre- and post-[dilution](../d/dilution.md) ownership percentages.

### Real-World Example: A Hypothetical Scenario

Assume a company, Tech Innovators Inc., is planning to raise a Series A round of $5 million at a pre-[money](../m/money.md) [valuation](../v/valuation.md) of $20 million. Before the Series A, the Cap Table is as follows:

#### Pre-Money Cap Table:

| [Shareholder](../s/shareholder.md)      | Number of [Shares](../s/shares.md) | % Ownership |
|------------------|------------------|-------------|
| Founder A        | 2,000,000        | 50%         |
| Founder B        | 1,000,000        | 25%         |
| Employee Stock [Options](../o/options.md) | 500,000    | 12.5%       |
| Angel Investors  | 500,000          | 12.5%       |
| **Total**        | **4,000,000**    | **100%**    |

Upon completion of the Series A round:

1. **New Investment**: $5 million
2. **Pre-[money](../m/money.md) [Valuation](../v/valuation.md)**: $20 million
3. **[Post-money Valuation](../p/post-money_valuation.md)**: $25 million

#### Post-Money Cap Table:

| [Shareholder](../s/shareholder.md)      | Number of [Shares](../s/shares.md) | % Ownership |
|------------------|------------------|-------------|
| Founder A        | 2,000,000        | 40%         |
| Founder B        | 1,000,000        | 20%         |
| Employee Stock [Options](../o/options.md) | 500,000    | 10%         |
| Angel Investors  | 500,000          | 10%         |
| Series A Investors | 1,250,000      | 20%         |
| **Total**        | **5,000,000**    | **100%**    |

The Series A investors now own 20% of the company post-[financing](../f/financing.md), while the existing shareholders' percentages have been diluted accordingly.

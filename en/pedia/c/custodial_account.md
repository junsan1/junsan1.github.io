# Custodial Account

Custodial accounts are a type of [financial account](../f/financial_account.md) set up by an adult on behalf of a minor or another individual who is incapable of managing their own finances. These accounts are typically used for saving and [investing](../i/investing.md) [money](../m/money.md) until the minor reaches adulthood or a predetermined age of majority. Custodial accounts are commonly used for educational savings, but they can also be utilized for other financial needs, such as buying a car or even saving for a property purchase. The [custodian](../c/custodian.md) maintains control over the account and is responsible for its management until the [beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md) is of age to take over.

## Structure and Function

A custodial account is legally owned by the minor, but the [custodian](../c/custodian.md) has the authority to manage the account until the minor becomes a legal adult. These accounts can contain various types of assets, including cash, [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, mutual funds, and other investments. The assets in a custodial account can be used for the minor's benefit, including educational expenses, medical care, and other needs.

### Types of Custodial Accounts

There are primarily two types of custodial accounts:
1. **Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA) Accounts:** These accounts allow for the transfer of various financial assets, including cash, securities, and [insurance](../i/insurance.md) policies, to minors without establishing a formal [trust](../t/trust.md).
   
2. **Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) Accounts:** UTMA accounts are similar to UGMA accounts but [offer](../o/offer.md) more flexibility. They allow for the transfer of a wider [range](../r/range.md) of assets, including [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) and certain types of [tangible personal property](../t/tangible_personal_property.md).

### Key Elements

1. **[Custodian](../c/custodian.md):** The person who opens and manages the custodial account. This is typically a parent or guardian.
2. **Minor/[Beneficiary](../b/beneficiary.md):** The legal owner of the account who [will](../w/will.md) [gain](../g/gain.md) full control when they reach the age of majority.
3. **Assets:** The financial products held within the account, which may include [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, mutual funds, and cash.

## Advantages

1. **Tax Benefits:** Some custodial accounts [offer](../o/offer.md) tax advantages. For example, the first $1,100 of [unearned income](../u/unearned_income.md) is generally [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md), the second $1,100 is taxed at the childâ€™s [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md), and any additional [income](../i/income.md) is taxed at the parent's rate.
   
2. **Flexibility:** Custodial accounts [offer](../o/offer.md) greater flexibility in terms of [asset](../a/asset.md) selection compared to other types of trusts or accounts designed for minors.
   
3. **Educational Savings:** They provide an effective way to save for educational expenses, [offering](../o/offering.md) a structured means to invest in the future.

## Disadvantages

1. **Irrevocability:** Once assets are transferred into a custodial account, they cannot be taken back. The transfer is irrevocable.

2. **Usage Limitations:** The assets can only be used for the benefit of the minor.

3. **Impact on Financial Aid:** The funds in a custodial account are considered the minor's assets and can impact eligibility for financial aid for college.

## Steps to Open a Custodial Account

1. **Choose a Financial Institution:** Select a [bank](../b/bank.md), [credit](../c/credit.md) union, or brokerage [firm](../f/firm.md) that offers custodial accounts.
2. **Complete the Application:** Fill out the required paperwork to establish the account.
3. **[Fund](../f/fund.md) the Account:** Transfer the desired assets into the custodial account.
4. **Manage the Account:** Oversee the investments and distributions for the minor's benefit.

## Key Regulations

### Age of Majority

The age at which the minor gains control over the account varies by state. In some states, this age is 18, while in others it can be as high as 25. The specific terms are outlined in the UGMA or UTMA under which the account was established.

### Reporting and Compliance

Custodial accounts are subject to specific regulations and reporting requirements, including tax filings. The [custodian](../c/custodian.md) must file [taxes](../t/taxes.md) for the minor if the [income](../i/income.md) exceeds certain thresholds.

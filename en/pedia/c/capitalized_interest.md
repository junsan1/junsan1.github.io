# Capitalized Interest

## Introduction

Capitalized [interest](../i/interest.md) is a part of the cost of constructing or acquiring an [asset](../a/asset.md) that a [firm](../f/firm.md) can include in its [accounting](../a/accounting.md) records and [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md). It is [interest](../i/interest.md) on borrowings used to [fund](../f/fund.md) the construction of [long-term assets](../l/long-term_assets.md). This [interest](../i/interest.md) is added to the cost of the [asset](../a/asset.md) and depreciated over the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s [useful life](../u/useful_life.md).

## Definition and Explanation

Capitalized [interest](../i/interest.md) is essentially [interest](../i/interest.md) incurred on funds borrowed to [finance](../f/finance.md) the construction of a long-term [asset](../a/asset.md). Instead of expensing this [interest](../i/interest.md) immediately, firms can add it to the cost of the [asset](../a/asset.md) and spread it over the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s life through [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md). This approach aligns the costs with the revenues generated by the [asset](../a/asset.md) over time.

This [accounting](../a/accounting.md) treatment is in accordance with Generally Accepted [Accounting Principles](../a/accounting_principles.md) (GAAP) and the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Both sets of standards recognize that capitalizing [interest](../i/interest.md) can better reflect the actual costs associated with developing [long-term assets](../l/long-term_assets.md) and provide a more accurate depiction of a company’s [financial health](../f/financial_health.md).

## Calculation of Capitalized Interest

The process of calculating capitalized [interest](../i/interest.md) involves determining the amount of [interest expense](../i/interest_expense.md) eligible to be capitalized during the period when the [asset](../a/asset.md) is being constructed. 

Key steps in the calculation include:
1. **Identifying the [loan](../l/loan.md) amounts and [interest](../i/interest.md) rates**: Companies must document all funds borrowed specifically for construction and the associated [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.
2. **Assessing the expenditures on the [asset](../a/asset.md)**: Only expenditures that are directly related to the construction of the [asset](../a/asset.md) are considered.
3. **Calculating [weighted](../w/weighted.md)-average accumulated expenditures**: This involves calculating the average amount of expenditures during the period based on when they were spent.
4. **Applying the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) to the [weighted](../w/weighted.md)-average expenditures**: This determines the total [interest expense](../i/interest_expense.md) that can be capitalized.

Mathematically, if a company has borrowed two different amounts, A and B, at [interest](../i/interest.md) rates A_rate and B_rate respectively for constructing an [asset](../a/asset.md), the [weighted](../w/weighted.md)-average accumulated expenditures and the total capitalized [interest](../i/interest.md) are calculated as follows:

```
[Weighted](../w/weighted.md)-Average Accumulated Expenditures = (A * Time spent on [asset](../a/asset.md) A + B * Time spent on [asset](../a/asset.md) B) / Total time period

Total Capitalized [Interest](../i/interest.md) = [Weighted](../w/weighted.md)-Average Accumulated Expenditures * Average [Interest Rate](../i/interest_rate.md)
```

## Impact on Financial Statements

### Balance Sheet

When [interest](../i/interest.md) is capitalized, it increases the initial cost base of the [asset](../a/asset.md). This means that the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s [book value](../b/book_value.md) on the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) is higher due to the addition of the capitalized [interest](../i/interest.md). Over time, as the [asset](../a/asset.md) is depreciated, the capitalized [interest](../i/interest.md) is also expensed through [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md).

### Income Statement

Expensing the [interest](../i/interest.md) directly would have immediately reduced net [income](../i/income.md). However, by capitalizing the [interest](../i/interest.md), companies spread the [expense](../e/expense.md) over several periods. This results in a higher initial net [income](../i/income.md) but does involve [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) expenses in future periods.

### Cash Flow Statement

Capitalizing [interest](../i/interest.md) does not affect the [cash flow statement](../c/cash_flow_statement.md) directly in terms of operating [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md), but it [will](../w/will.md) reflect under the [investing](../i/investing.md) activities section as part of the [asset](../a/asset.md)’s purchase cost.

## Real-World Examples

### General Electric

General Electric (GE) has been known to practice [interest](../i/interest.md) [capitalization](../c/capitalization.md). For their large-scale projects like building power plants or aviation turbines, where substantial [capital](../c/capital.md) expenditures are required, GE capitalizes these costs to better match the long-term [revenue](../r/revenue.md) streams generated by these assets.

### Apple Inc.

Apple Inc. capitalizes [interest](../i/interest.md) on certain [capital](../c/capital.md) projects including their construction of new campuses and data centers. This helps them manage their financial reporting strategies efficiently and presents a more accurate picture of the company's long-term [asset](../a/asset.md) investments.

### [Microsoft Corporation](https://www.microsoft.com/)

Microsoft, like many large tech firms, capitalizes [interest](../i/interest.md) on significant construction projects such as building data centers. Given the tech giant's massive [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) investments, capitalizing [interest](../i/interest.md) ensures that these costs are allocated appropriately over the assets' useful lives.

### [Tesla, Inc.](https://www.tesla.com/)

Tesla capitalizes [interest](../i/interest.md) on the construction of their gigafactories and other large-scale [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) facilities. For a company [investing](../i/investing.md) heavily in expanding its [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) capabilities, this approach allows Tesla to better align the enormous upfront [capital](../c/capital.md) costs with future [revenue](../r/revenue.md).

## Regulatory Considerations

### GAAP

Under GAAP (specifically ASC 835-20), [interest](../i/interest.md) [capitalization](../c/capitalization.md) during the construction of a qualifying [asset](../a/asset.md) is required. GAAP stipulates that the [capitalization](../c/capitalization.md) period begins when expenditures are incurred, activities necessary to prepare the [asset](../a/asset.md) for its intended use are in progress, and [interest](../i/interest.md) cost is being incurred.

### IFRS

IFRS (specifically IAS 23) also requires [capitalization](../c/capitalization.md) of borrowing costs directly attributable to the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md), construction, or production of a qualifying [asset](../a/asset.md). The costs should be capitalized when it is probable they [will](../w/will.md) result in future economic benefits, and the costs can be measured reliably.

### Tax Implications

Tax treatment of capitalized [interest](../i/interest.md) can vary. In some jurisdictions, firms might get tax deductions for [interest](../i/interest.md) expenses only in the period when they are capitalized and depreciated, rather than expensed immediately. This could impact deferred tax liabilities and assets on firms' balance sheets.

## Conclusion

Capitalized [interest](../i/interest.md) is a sophisticated [accounting](../a/accounting.md) treatment that helps companies better match their long-term costs with revenues, providing a clearer picture of [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md). By spreading the cost of borrowing over the life of an [asset](../a/asset.md), firms can manage expenses in a way that more accurately reflects the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s contribution to future [revenue](../r/revenue.md). This practice demonstrates the importance of understanding both the operational aspects of long-term [asset management](../a/asset_management.md) and the regulatory requirements governing financial reporting.

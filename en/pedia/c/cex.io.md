# CEX.IO

CEX.IO is a prominent cryptocurrency [exchange](../e/exchange.md) platform that offers a wide [range](../r/range.md) of services to both individual and institutional traders. Established in 2013 in London, CEX.IO has become a trusted name in the cryptocurrency [industry](../i/industry.md). Initially, the platform started as a cloud [mining](../m/mining.md) provider, but it quickly evolved into a multifaceted [exchange](../e/exchange.md) that supports a variety of trading activities, including spot trading, [margin trading](../m/margin_trading.md), staking, and lending. This article [will](../w/will.md) provide a detailed overview of CEX.IO, its history, services, features, and the technology that underpins its trading capabilities.

# History and Development

CEX.IO was founded by Oleksandr Lutskevych in 2013. Initially, the platform offered cloud [mining](../m/mining.md) services by leveraging its specialized hardware known as GHash.IO. By the end of 2014, GHash.IO controlled nearly 42% of the [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) hashing power, making it one of the most significant [mining](../m/mining.md) pools at the time. However, in January 2015, CEX.IO discontinued its cloud [mining](../m/mining.md) services due to adverse [market](../m/market.md) conditions and shifted its focus entirely to cryptocurrency trading.

Since then, CEX.IO has built a [robust](../r/robust.md) platform [offering](../o/offering.md) a comprehensive set of trading tools and services. The company is headquartered in London and operates globally, serving millions of users across the world.

# Services Offered

CEX.IO offers a wide [range](../r/range.md) of services designed to cater to different types of traders, from beginners to professionals. These services include:

### Spot Trading

Spot trading is the most basic form of trading that CEX.IO offers. Users can buy and sell various cryptocurrencies directly at current [market](../m/market.md) prices. The platform supports a wide [range](../r/range.md) of cryptocurrencies, including [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md) (BTC), [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) (ETH), [Ripple](../r/ripple.md) (XRP), [Bitcoin Cash](../b/bitcoin_cash.md) (BCH), Litecoin (LTC), and many others. CEX.IO provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it accessible for novices while [offering](../o/offering.md) advanced charting tools and [order types](../o/order_types_in_trading.md) for experienced traders.

### Margin Trading

For traders looking to amplify their gains, CEX.IO offers [margin trading](../m/margin_trading.md) services. Users can [trade](../t/trade.md) on [margin](../m/margin.md) by borrowing funds to increase their [buying power](../b/buying_power.md). This service allows users to [open](../o/open.md) larger positions than what their [capital](../c/capital.md) would typically allow. CEX.IO offers [leverage](../l/leverage.md) of up to 10x on certain trading pairs. [Margin trading](../m/margin_trading.md) comes with inherent risks, including the potential for substantial losses, but it also provides opportunities for significant gains.

### Staking

CEX.IO has introduced staking services for users who prefer a more passive way of earning rewards. Staking involves holding and locking up specific cryptocurrencies in a wallet to support the operation of a [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) network. In [return](../r/return.md), participants receive staking rewards, which can be thought of as [interest](../i/interest.md) payments. The platform currently supports staking for several cryptocurrencies, including [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) 2.0, [Tezos](../t/tezos.md) (XTZ), and Cardano (ADA).

### Crypto Lending

Another financial product available on CEX.IO is crypto lending. This service allows users to lend their cryptocurrencies and earn [interest](../i/interest.md) in [return](../r/return.md). Borrowers can obtain funds by providing crypto [collateral](../c/collateral.md), and lenders earn [interest](../i/interest.md) on their lent assets. This service is particularly useful for users who prefer to generate [passive income](../p/passive_income.md) from their cryptocurrency [holdings](../h/holdings.md) without having to sell them.

### Instant Buy

For users looking for a quick and straightforward way to purchase cryptocurrencies, CEX.IO offers an Instant Buy service. This feature allows users to buy crypto using their [credit](../c/credit.md) or [debit](../d/debit.md) cards instantly. The platform supports [multiple](../m/multiple.md) fiat currencies, including USD, EUR, GBP, and RUB. This service is ideal for beginners who want to enter the cryptocurrency [market](../m/market.md) without dealing with complex trading interfaces.

### API Trading

CEX.IO also provides an API for automated trading, enabling developers and traders to build custom trading bots and integrate CEX.IO’s trading capabilities into their applications. The API supports various functions, including placing and canceling orders, retrieving [market](../m/market.md) data, and managing account balances.

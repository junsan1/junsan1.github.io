## What is a CFP?

A Certified [Financial Planner](../f/financial_planner.md) (CFP) is a professional who has met the education, examination, experience, and [ethical standards](../e/ethical_standards_in_trading.md) set by the CFP Board. CFPs are trained to develop and implement financial plans for individuals, families, and organizations.

The goal of a CFP is to help clients achieve their financial goals and manage their financial resources more effectively.

## Educational Requirements

To become a CFP, candidates must first complete a comprehensive education program. The educational requirement typically includes taking courses in the following areas:

## Examination

Upon completing the educational requirements, candidates must pass the CFP Certification Examination. The CFP Exam is a rigorous, 170-question test administered over two days. It covers a wide [range](../r/range.md) of [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md) topics, including ethics, [tax planning](../t/tax_planning.md), investment planning, [retirement planning](../r/retirement_planning.md), [insurance](../i/insurance.md), and [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md).

## Experience

In addition to education and examination requirements, CFP candidates must demonstrate professional experience in the [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md) field. The CFP Board requires candidates to have at least 6,000 hours of professional [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md) experience or 4,000 hours of apprenticeship experience that meets additional requirements. This experience ensures that CFP professionals have practical, hands-on knowledge and are well-prepared to [offer](../o/offer.md) [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md) services.

## Ethical Standards

CFPs commit to upholding a stringent [code of ethics](../c/code_of_ethics.md) and professional responsibility.

This requirement ensures that CFPs keep their knowledge and skills up-to-date and continue to provide high-quality advice to their clients.

## CFP Board

The CFP Board is the organization responsible for certifying and regulating CFP professionals in the United States. It sets the standards for certification, administers the examination, and enforces the [code of ethics](../c/code_of_ethics.md) and professional responsibility.

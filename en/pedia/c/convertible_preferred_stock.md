# Convertible Preferred Stock

Convertible [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md) is a type of [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md) that includes an option for the holder to convert the preferred [shares](../s/shares.md) into a fixed number of common [shares](../s/shares.md), usually after a predetermined date. As a [hybrid security](../h/hybrid_security.md), it possesses characteristics both of [debt](../d/debt.md)—providing [fixed income](../f/fixed_income.md) and priority over common [stocks](../s/stock.md)—and [equity](../e/equity.md), allowing for potential [upside](../u/upside.md) through conversion to [common stock](../c/common_stock.md). The specific terms of the conversion feature, including the conversion ratio and conversion price, are stipulated at issuance.

## Key Characteristics of Convertible Preferred Stock

### 1. **Fixed Dividend Payments** 

Holders of convertible [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md) receive fixed [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payments, typically on a quarterly [basis](../b/basis.md). These dividends are usually higher than those paid on [common stock](../c/common_stock.md) and are declared as a percentage of the [par value](../p/par_value.md) of the [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md). This feature provides a reliable [income](../i/income.md) stream for investors.

### 2. **Preference Over Common Stock in Liquidation**

In the event of [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md), convertible preferred shareholders have priority over common stockholders. They [will](../w/will.md) be paid out of the assets of the [corporation](../c/corporation.md) before any [distribution](../d/distribution.md) to common shareholders. However, they rank below [debt](../d/debt.md) holders in the claim hierarchy.

### 3. **Convertible Feature**

The most distinguishing feature of convertible [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md) is the option to convert into a predetermined number of common [shares](../s/shares.md). The conversion can be done:
- **At the discretion of the [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md)**: Shareholders may choose to convert their [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md) at a time of their choosing, provided it is past the stipulated period mentioned in the terms at issuance.
- **Automatically**: Conversion might be automatic if certain conditions are met such as the [common stock](../c/common_stock.md) price reaching a specified level.

### 4. **Conversion Ratio and Conversion Price**

The conversion ratio is the number of common [shares](../s/shares.md) a preferred [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) [will](../w/will.md) receive upon conversion. The conversion price is the price at which the [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) can convert each preferred share into common [shares](../s/shares.md). This price is typically set at a [premium](../p/premium.md) to the price of the common [shares](../s/shares.md) at the time the preferred [shares](../s/shares.md) are issued.

### 5. **Callable Feature**

Some convertible preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) come with a callable feature, allowing the issuing company to repurchase the stock at a predetermined call price before the conversion date. This call price is generally higher than the original [issue](../i/issue.md) price and provides an incentive for the company to buy back the stock if it becomes unfavorable for them by paying higher dividends.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

- **[Income](../i/income.md) Stability**: Provides a stable [income](../i/income.md) through fixed [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payments.
- **Conversion Benefit**: Offers potential for [capital](../c/capital.md) appreciation through conversion to [common stock](../c/common_stock.md).
- **Priority in [Liquidation](../l/liquidation.md)**: Provides higher seniority in case of [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md) compared to common stockholders.

### Disadvantages

- **[Dividend](../d/dividend.md) [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: Dividends are not guaranteed and may be omitted if the company faces financial difficulties.
- **[Market Value](../m/market_value.md) Fluctuations**: The [market value](../m/market_value.md) of convertible [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md) can fluctuate based on changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [common stock](../c/common_stock.md)’s performance.
- **Call [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: If the stock is callable, investors face the [risk](../r/risk.md) of the company redeeming the stock before the [investor](../i/investor.md) wants to convert.

## Practical Uses of Convertible Preferred Stock

### 1. **Attracting Investors**

Convertible [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md) is appealing to investors who seek higher yields compared to common [stocks](../s/stock.md) and want potential [upside](../u/upside.md) without as much [risk](../r/risk.md). Startups and companies in early growth stages often use it to attract investment without diluting existing shareholders immediately.

### 2. **Corporate Financing Strategy**

Companies use convertible [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md) as a means of [financing](../f/financing.md) that blends features of [debt](../d/debt.md) and [equity](../e/equity.md). It is a less expensive way to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) compared to issuing pure [equity](../e/equity.md) since preferred dividends are usually lower than the [equity](../e/equity.md) [dilution](../d/dilution.md) costs of issuing [common stock](../c/common_stock.md). Firms also use it to defer [dilution](../d/dilution.md) and associated [earnings](../e/earnings.md)-per-share reductions.

### 3. **Retaining Strategic Investors**

Convertible [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md) can be structured to align investors' interests with the long-term performance of the company. Investors retain a protective [dividend](../d/dividend.md) and [liquidation preference](../l/liquidation_preference.md) while also having the potential to share in the company’s [upside](../u/upside.md) through conversion.

This strategy allowed [Berkshire Hathaway](../b/berkshire_hathaway.md) to earn stable returns and later benefit from the appreciation in [Bank](../b/bank.md) of America’s stock.

Convertible [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md) has been a significant instrument in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) for decades.

The 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) also saw a surge in the issuance of convertible preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) as banks and financial institutions aimed to bolster their balance sheets with hybrid financial instruments.

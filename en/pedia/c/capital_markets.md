# Capital Markets

Capital Markets refers to the part of the financial system concerned with raising capital by dealing in shares, bonds, and other long-term investments. It primarily involves trading securities and investment instruments, typically through both retail and institutional investors. In this section, we will explore various facets of capital markets, encompassing their structure, functions, different segments, regulatory environment, instruments, major players, and the technology that fuels their operations.

## Structure of Capital Markets

Capital markets can be broadly classified into two main categories: primary markets and secondary markets. 

### Primary Markets

Primary markets are venues where new securities are issued and sold for the first time. This process is known as an Initial Public Offering (IPO) when a company issues stock to the public for the first time. Other financial instruments such as bonds, debentures, and commercial paper are also issued in the primary market. The funds raised in primary markets are channeled directly to the issuers, typically businesses, and governments.

The primary market plays a critical role in capital formation, enabling companies to raise the necessary funds to expand operations, invest in new projects, and fuel overall economic growth.

### Secondary Markets

Secondary markets are where previously issued securities are traded among investors. Stock exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), NASDAQ, London Stock Exchange (LSE), and Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) are prime examples. Here, the issuing company does not receive funds directly; rather, buyers and sellers trade amongst themselves.

The secondary market provides liquidity, enabling investors to buy and sell securities with ease. It also offers continuous price discovery and aids in the efficient allocation of resources.

## Functions of Capital Markets

Capital markets serve several vital functions, including:

1. **Price Discovery**: Capital markets help in the determination of prices for securities through the interactions of buyers and sellers. The equilibrium price forms based on demand and supply.

2. **Liquidity Provision**: They provide a platform where investors can easily buy and sell securities. This liquidity makes capital markets attractive for investors.

3. **Capital Formation**: They enable firms and governments to raise long-term funds, contributing to economic development.

4. **Risk Transfer**: Through instruments like derivatives, investors can hedge against risks such as changes in interest rates, currency prices, or commodity prices.

5. **Efficiency**: They lead to an efficient allocation of resources by directing capital to the most productive uses.

## Segments of Capital Markets

### Equity Markets

Equity markets deal with trading in equity shares of companies, including:

- **Common Stocks**: Represent ownership in a company and entitle holders to part of the profits, usually through dividends.
- **Preferred Stocks**: Entail a higher claim on assets and earnings than common stocks, often offering fixed dividends.

### Debt Markets

Debt markets involve the trading of debt instruments like:

- **Government Bonds**: Debt securities issued by a government to support spending and obligations. Examples include U.S. Treasuries, UK Gilts, and Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs).

### Derivatives Markets

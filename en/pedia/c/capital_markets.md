# Capital Markets

[Capital](../c/capital.md) Markets refers to the part of the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md) concerned with raising [capital](../c/capital.md) by dealing in [shares](../s/shares.md), bonds, and other [long-term investments](../l/long-term_investments.md). It primarily involves trading securities and investment instruments, typically through both retail and institutional investors. In this section, we [will](../w/will.md) explore various facets of [capital](../c/capital.md) markets, encompassing their structure, functions, different segments, regulatory environment, instruments, major players, and the technology that fuels their operations.

## Structure of Capital Markets

[Capital](../c/capital.md) markets can be broadly classified into two main categories: primary markets and secondary markets. 

### Primary Markets

Primary markets are venues where new securities are issued and sold for the first time. This process is known as an Initial Public [Offering](../o/offering.md) (IPO) when a company issues stock to the public for the first time. Other financial instruments such as bonds, debentures, and [commercial paper](../c/commercial_paper.md) are also issued in the [primary market](../p/primary_market.md). The funds raised in primary markets are channeled directly to the issuers, typically businesses, and governments.

The [primary market](../p/primary_market.md) plays a critical role in [capital](../c/capital.md) formation, enabling companies to raise the necessary funds to expand operations, invest in new projects, and fuel overall [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md).

### Secondary Markets

Secondary markets are where previously issued securities are traded among investors. Stock exchanges like the New York Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (NYSE), [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md), London Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (LSE), and Tokyo Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (TSE) are prime examples. Here, the issuing company does not receive funds directly; rather, buyers and sellers [trade](../t/trade.md) amongst themselves.

The [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md) provides [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), enabling investors to buy and sell securities with ease. It also offers continuous [price discovery](../p/price_discovery.md) and aids in the efficient allocation of resources.

## Functions of Capital Markets

[Capital](../c/capital.md) markets serve several vital functions, including:

1. **[Price Discovery](../p/price_discovery.md)**: [Capital](../c/capital.md) markets help in the determination of prices for securities through the interactions of buyers and sellers. The [equilibrium](../e/equilibrium.md) price forms based on [demand](../d/demand.md) and [supply](../s/supply.md).

2. **[Liquidity Provision](../l/liquidity_provision.md)**: They provide a platform where investors can easily buy and sell securities. This [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) makes [capital](../c/capital.md) markets attractive for investors.

3. **[Capital](../c/capital.md) Formation**: They enable firms and governments to raise long-term funds, contributing to economic development.

4. **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Transfer**: Through instruments like [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), investors can [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against risks such as changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, [currency](../c/currency.md) prices, or [commodity](../c/commodity.md) prices.

5. **[Efficiency](../e/efficiency.md)**: They lead to an efficient allocation of resources by directing [capital](../c/capital.md) to the most productive uses.

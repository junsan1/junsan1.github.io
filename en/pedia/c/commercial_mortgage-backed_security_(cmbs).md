# Commercial Mortgage-Backed Security (CMBS)

A Commercial [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-Backed [Security](../s/security.md) (CMBS) is a type of [fixed-income security](../f/fixed-income_security.md) that is backed by [commercial real estate](../c/commercial_real_estate.md) loans. These securities are created through a [securitization](../s/securitization.md) process, where [multiple](../m/multiple.md) commercial mortgages are pooled together and sold to investors in the form of bonds. The primary objective of CMBS is to provide [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) to the [commercial real estate](../c/commercial_real_estate.md) [market](../m/market.md) and [offer](../o/offer.md) investors an opportunity to earn returns based on the performance of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) loans.

## Structure of CMBS

### Loan Pooling and Tranching
The [securitization](../s/securitization.md) process begins with the pooling of commercial [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) loans. These loans are typically secured by properties such as office buildings, retail centers, multifamily apartments, hotels, and industrial properties. Once pooled, the loans are divided into different [tranches](../t/tranches.md) based on their [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md) profiles.

Each tranche has its own [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md), which reflects the level of [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) loans. Higher-rated [tranches](../t/tranches.md) (e.g., [AAA](../a/aaa.md)) usually carry lower [risk](../r/risk.md) and [offer](../o/offer.md) lower yields, while lower-rated [tranches](../t/tranches.md) (e.g., BBB or below) come with higher [risk](../r/risk.md) but [offer](../o/offer.md) higher potential returns.

### Servicing and Special Servicing
Servicing refers to the management of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) loans, including collecting [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) payments and managing defaults. A master servicer oversees the overall administration of the [loan](../l/loan.md) pool, while a special servicer handles loans that are in [default](../d/default.md) or at [risk](../r/risk.md) of [default](../d/default.md). The special servicer's role is crucial in mitigating losses and maximizing recovery for investors.

### Payment Waterfall
The [payment](../p/payment.md) structure of CMBS follows a waterfall mechanism, where cash flows from the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) loans are distributed to investors in a predetermined [order](../o/order.md) of priority. Senior [tranches](../t/tranches.md) receive payments first, followed by subordinated [tranches](../t/tranches.md). This prioritization ensures that senior tranche investors are protected from losses to a greater extent than those holding subordinate [tranches](../t/tranches.md).

## Types of CMBS

### Conduit CMBS
Conduit CMBS, also known as fusion CMBS, are the most common type. They consist of a large pool of diverse commercial [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) loans, which reduces the [risk](../r/risk.md) of [default](../d/default.md) related to any single [loan](../l/loan.md). The variety of property types and geographical locations provides investors with broad exposure to the [commercial real estate](../c/commercial_real_estate.md) [market](../m/market.md).

### Single-Asset Single-Borrower (SASB) CMBS
SASB CMBS are backed by a single [loan](../l/loan.md) secured by a single property or a portfolio of properties from a single borrower. These securities tend to have higher [risk](../r/risk.md) due to their lack of [diversification](../d/diversification.md) but can [offer](../o/offer.md) attractive returns. SASB CMBS are often used for large, high-quality properties with strong tenant leases and well-capitalized sponsors.

### Agency CMBS
Agency CMBS are issued by government-sponsored entities (GSEs) such as Fannie Mae and [Freddie Mac](../f/freddie_mac.md). They focus on multifamily properties and provide investors with a higher degree of safety due to the implicit government guarantee. Agency CMBS [offer](../o/offer.md) stability and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), making them appealing to conservative investors.

## Risks Associated with CMBS

### Credit Risk
[Credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) involves the possibility that borrowers may [default](../d/default.md) on their [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) payments. The [risk](../r/risk.md) is higher for lower-rated [tranches](../t/tranches.md) and for CMBS with concentrated exposure to specific property types or locations.

### Market Risk
[Market risk](../m/market_risk.md) refers to fluctuations in the [value](../v/value.md) of CMBS due to changes in [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md), [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, and property [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md). A downturn in the [commercial real estate](../c/commercial_real_estate.md) [market](../m/market.md) can negatively impact the performance of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) loans and, consequently, the CMBS.

### Extension Risk
Extension [risk](../r/risk.md) occurs when loans are not repaid at their expected [maturity date](../m/maturity_date.md), extending the life of the CMBS. This can happen if borrowers [refinance](../r/refinance.md) their loans at unfavorable terms or if the commercial property [market](../m/market.md) experiences a slowdown.

### Prepayment Risk
[Prepayment risk](../p/prepayment_risk.md) is the [risk](../r/risk.md) that borrowers [will](../w/will.md) repay their loans earlier than expected. Early repayments can lead to a loss of expected [interest](../i/interest.md) [income](../i/income.md) and force investors to reinvest at potentially lower yields.

## Evaluation and Rating of CMBS

Independent [credit rating](../c/credit_rating.md) agencies such as Moody's, Standard & Poor's, and [Fitch Ratings](../f/fitch_ratings.md) assess the [credit](../c/credit.md) quality of CMBS [tranches](../t/tranches.md). They consider factors such as the [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) of borrowers, the quality and [value](../v/value.md) of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) properties, and the overall macroeconomic environment. Ratings [range](../r/range.md) from investment-grade (e.g., [AAA](../a/aaa.md), AA) to speculative-grade (e.g., BBB, BB).

# Combined Ratio

## Definition
The Combined Ratio is a key metric in the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) [industry](../i/industry.md) that measures the profitability of an [insurance](../i/insurance.md) company's [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) operations. This ratio sums up the [loss ratio](../l/loss_ratio.md) and the [expense ratio](../e/expense_ratio.md) to provide a comprehensive assessment of an insurer's [operational efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md). Specifically, the Combined Ratio is expressed as a percentage and calculated using the following formula:

\[ \text{Combined Ratio} = \text{Loss Ratio} + \text{[Expense Ratio](../e/expense_ratio.md)} \]

### Loss Ratio
The [Loss Ratio](../l/loss_ratio.md) measures the proportion of claims paid out to policyholders relative to the premiums earned. It is calculated with the following formula:

\[ \text{[Loss Ratio](../l/loss_ratio.md)} = \frac{\text{Incurred Losses} + \text{Loss Adjustment Expenses}}{\text{Premiums Earned}} \]

Where:
- **Incurred Losses** are the total amount paid or expected to be paid for claims.
- **Loss Adjustment Expenses** (LAE) are the costs associated with investigating and settling claims.

### Expense Ratio
The [Expense Ratio](../e/expense_ratio.md) indicates the proportion of [underwriting expenses](../u/underwriting_expenses.md) (excluding claims) to premiums earned. It is calculated as:

\[ \text{Expense Ratio} = \frac{\text{[Underwriting Expenses](../u/underwriting_expenses.md)}}{\text{Premiums Earned}} \]

Where:
- **[Underwriting Expenses](../u/underwriting_expenses.md)** include salaries, commissions, administrative costs, [marketing](../m/marketing.md) expenses, and other costs associated with issuing and maintaining [insurance](../i/insurance.md) policies.

## Significance
The Combined Ratio is crucial because it provides insights into the operational health and profitability of an [insurance](../i/insurance.md) company, excluding [investment income](../i/investment_income.md). An important thing to [note](../n/note.md) is that:
- A Combined Ratio below 100% indicates that the company is making an [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) [profit](../p/profit.md).
- A Combined Ratio above 100% signifies an [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) loss, meaning the company is paying out more in claims and expenses than it is earning from premiums.

## Interpretation
1. **Combined Ratio < 100%**: The company is profitable in its [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) operations, i.e., its core [business](../b/business.md).
2. **Combined Ratio = 100%**: The company is breaking even on its [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) activities.
3. **Combined Ratio > 100%**: The company is unprofitable in its [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) operations.

### Practical Example
Consider an [insurance](../i/insurance.md) company with the following figures for a given period:
- Incurred Losses: \$500,000
- Loss Adjustment Expenses: \$100,000
- Premiums Earned: \$800,000
- [Underwriting Expenses](../u/underwriting_expenses.md): \$200,000

Using these figures:
\[ \text{[Loss Ratio](../l/loss_ratio.md)} = \frac{500,000 + 100,000}{800,000} = 0.75 \text{ or } 75\% \]
\[ \text{[Expense Ratio](../e/expense_ratio.md)} = \frac{200,000}{800,000} = 0.25 \text{ or } 25\% \]

Combined Ratio:
\[ \text{Combined Ratio} = 75\% + 25\% = 100\% \]

This indicates that the company is breaking even on its [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) activities.

## Combined Ratio vs. Operating Ratio
While the Combined Ratio focuses strictly on [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) profitability, the Operating Ratio provides a more comprehensive view by including [investment income](../i/investment_income.md). The Operating Ratio is computed as follows:

\[ \text{Operating Ratio} = \text{Combined Ratio} - \text{Net [Investment Income](../i/investment_income.md) Ratio} \]

Where:
- **Net [Investment Income](../i/investment_income.md) Ratio** is the percentage of [investment income](../i/investment_income.md) to earned premiums.

### Example
If, in addition to the figures provided in the previous example, the company earned \$50,000 in [investment income](../i/investment_income.md), the Net [Investment Income](../i/investment_income.md) Ratio would be:

\[ \text{Net [Investment Income](../i/investment_income.md) Ratio} = \frac{50,000}{800,000} = 0.0625 \text{ or } 6.25\% \]

Thus, the Operating Ratio would be:
\[ \text{Operating Ratio} = 100\% - 6.25\% = 93.75\% \]

## Industry Benchmarks and Trends
Different segments of the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) [industry](../i/industry.md) may have varying benchmarks for what constitutes a healthy Combined Ratio. For instance:
- Property and casualty insurers generally aim for a Combined Ratio below 100%.
- Health insurers might have [industry](../i/industry.md)-specific considerations that affect their target Combined Ratios.

Additionally, trends in the Combined Ratio can signal shifts in the [market](../m/market.md) or changes in company strategy. For instance:
- An improving Combined Ratio over time may indicate better [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), improved claims processing [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md), or more favorable [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) conditions.
- A deteriorating Combined Ratio could [warrant](../w/warrant.md) closer scrutiny, potentially indicating rising claims costs, increased competition, or operational inefficiencies.

### Real-World Example: Progressive Corporation
Progressive [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) is one of the leading [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies globally. As of the most recent [annual report](../a/annual_report.md), Progressive disclosed their Combined Ratio, which serves as a critical [indicator](../i/indicator.md) for analysts and investors:

## Conclusion
The Combined Ratio is a fundamental metric for assessing the [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) performance of an [insurance](../i/insurance.md) company. It provides an essential [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for analyzing the [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and profitability of an insurer's core operations. By understanding and monitoring this ratio, stakeholders can make more informed decisions about the company's [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and long-term viability.

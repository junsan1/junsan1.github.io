# Credit Card Dump

## Overview

A [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) dump is a digital collection of data that is extracted from the magnetic stripe or chip of a [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) using skimming devices or malware. This data can include the cardholder's name, card number, [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md), CVV code, and sometimes the PIN. The primary purpose of acquiring such dumps is for committing [fraud](../f/fraud.md), such as creating counterfeit cards or making unauthorized online purchases.

## How Credit Card Dumps Are Obtained

### Skimming Devices

Skimming involves attaching a small device to a legitimate card reader—such as those found at ATMs, gas pumps, and point-of-[sale](../s/sale.md) (POS) terminals—to capture the data stored on a card’s magnetic stripe. When a card is swiped or inserted, the skimmer records its details.

### Malware

Malware designed to steal [payment](../p/payment.md) card information can be installed on POS systems or infect users’ computers. For instance, POS malware can capture data directly from the system before it is encrypted and transmitted to the [payment](../p/payment.md) processor.

### Data Breaches

Large-scale data breaches at retail or financial services companies can also result in the loss of vast numbers of [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) details. Hackers infiltrate databases and exfiltrate the sensitive information stored within them.

## The Black Market for Credit Card Dumps

Once acquired, [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) dumps are typically sold on underground marketplaces on the [dark web](../d/dark_web.md). These markets operate with relative anonymity and may involve fake or stolen identities. Prices for dumps vary depending on the completeness of the data and the originating country of the card.

## Impact on Stakeholders

### Cardholders

Victims of [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) [fraud](../f/fraud.md) suffer monetary losses and the inconvenience of resolving unauthorized transactions. While banks and [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) companies often reimburse these losses, the process can be time-consuming and stressful.

### Financial Institutions

Banks and [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) companies must bear the financial burden of reimbursing [fraud](../f/fraud.md) losses. They also invest heavily in [security](../s/security.md) and [fraud](../f/fraud.md) detection systems to mitigate [risk](../r/risk.md), which contributes to rising operational costs.

### Merchants

Businesses affected by [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) [fraud](../f/fraud.md) may face chargebacks, which are refunds processed by banks when cardholders dispute unauthorized transactions. Chargebacks can lead to financial loss and damage to reputations.

### Law Enforcement

Agencies tasked with investigating and prosecuting cybercrime must allocate resources for tracking down perpetrators of [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) [fraud](../f/fraud.md). This involves sophisticated techniques like tracing electronic transactions and monitoring underground markets.

## Prevention and Mitigation

### EMV Technology

The implementation of chip-and-pin (EMV) cards has significantly reduced the [risk](../r/risk.md) posed by skimming devices. EMV cards generate unique [transaction](../t/transaction.md) codes that cannot be reused, thereby preventing certain types of [fraud](../f/fraud.md).

### Two-Factor Authentication

Adding an extra layer of [security](../s/security.md), such as two-[factor](../f/factor.md) authentication (2FA), can help reduce [fraud](../f/fraud.md) in online transactions. This requires users to verify their identity through an additional method, such as a text message or mobile app.

### Security Awareness

Education is crucial to mitigating risks. Cardholders should be aware of how to recognize phishing attempts, secure their physical cards, and monitor their statements for unauthorized transactions.

### Fraud Detection Systems

Financial institutions use advanced analytics and [machine learning algorithms](../m/machine_learning_algorithms_in_trading.md) to identify unusual patterns of activity that may indicate [fraud](../f/fraud.md). These systems can flag suspicious transactions for further review.

### Regulatory Compliance

Compliance with regulations such as the [Payment](../p/payment.md) Card [Industry](../i/industry.md) [Data Security](../d/data_security_in_trading.md) Standard (PCI DSS) is mandatory for businesses that [handle](../h/handle.md) [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) transactions. These standards outline requirements for securing cardholder data.

## Notable Incidents

### Target Data Breach (2013)

In one of the most infamous data breaches, hackers stole [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) information from approximately 40 million Target customers. Malware installed on POS terminals captured [payment](../p/payment.md) card data during transactions.

### Home Depot Data Breach (2014)

A similar breach at [Home](../h/home.md) Depot resulted in the theft of data belonging to around 56 million [credit](../c/credit.md) cards. The attackers used custom-built malware to penetrate the company's network and access the information.

## Conclusion

While advances in technology and [security](../s/security.md) measures have made significant strides in combating [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) [fraud](../f/fraud.md), the threat of [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) dumps remains an ongoing concern. Stakeholders ranging from individual consumers to multinational corporations must stay vigilant and adopt comprehensive strategies to prevent and mitigate the impact of these criminal activities.

# Cost, Insurance and Freight (CIF)

Cost, [Insurance](../i/insurance.md), and Freight (CIF) is one of the eleven [Incoterms](../i/incoterms.md) or International Commercial Terms established by the International Chamber of [Commerce](../c/commerce.md) (ICC) to regulate international [trade](../t/trade.md). CIF is used to signify the responsibilities and [obligations](../o/obligation.md) of buyers and sellers involved in global transactions, specifically pertaining to the costs associated with shipping goods.

## Definition of CIF

Under CIF terms, the seller is responsible for:
- The cost of the goods.
- [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) to cover the goods during transit.
- Freight charges to transport the goods to the buyer's port of destination.
  
However, once the goods are loaded on the shipping vessel, the [risk](../r/risk.md) of loss or damage transfers from the seller to the buyer. This means that while the seller handles the majority of the shipping and [insurance](../i/insurance.md) documentation, any incidents that occur during transit become the buyer's responsibility from the point of loading onwards.

## Historical Context

The [Incoterms](../i/incoterms.md) were first published in 1936 by the ICC to bring clarity and reduce conflicts in international [trade](../t/trade.md). CIF has been one of the cornerstone terms, commonly used in maritime shipping due to its clear delineation of responsibility between buyer and seller.

## CIF Responsibilities

### Seller’s Responsibilities

1. **Cost of Goods:** The seller is first and foremost responsible for producing and/or supplying the ordered goods.
2. **Packing:** Proper packing of the goods to meet international shipping standards and regulations.
3. **[Export](../e/export.md) Licenses:** Obtaining any necessary [export](../e/export.md) licenses or other official authorizations.
4. **Carriage to Port of [Export](../e/export.md):** Arranging and paying for transportation to the port where the goods [will](../w/will.md) be loaded onto the vessel.
5. **Loading Charges:** Covering the cost of loading the goods onto the shipping vessel.
6. **Freight Charges:** Paying for the transportation of the goods to the buyer's port of destination.
7. **[Insurance](../i/insurance.md):** Obtaining minimum [insurance](../i/insurance.md) coverage to protect the buyer's [interest](../i/interest.md) from the point of shipment to the destination port.

### Buyer’s Responsibilities

1. **[Import](../i/import.md) Licenses:** Obtaining any required [import](../i/import.md) licenses and permits.
2. **[Risk](../r/risk.md):** Bearing the [risk](../r/risk.md) of loss or damage after the goods have been loaded onto the vessel at the port of shipment.
3. **Unloading and Further Transport:** Covering the costs and [logistics](../l/logistics.md) involved in unloading the goods at the destination port and transporting them to their final destination.
4. **Customs Duties:** Paying for any [import](../i/import.md) duties, [taxes](../t/taxes.md), and customs clearance fees.

## Insurance Requirement

The [insurance](../i/insurance.md) component under CIF terms is often a critical aspect. According to CIF standards, the seller must secure a minimum coverage amounting to 110% of the goods' [value](../v/value.md). This [insurance](../i/insurance.md) must comply with the coverage stipulated in the Institute Cargo Clauses (C), or any similar set of internationally recognized clauses.

## CIF Application and Limitations

CIF terms are exclusively used for maritime and inland waterway transport. They are often preferred by sellers who want to demonstrate a higher level of service by taking on the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) and freight responsibilities. Buyers, on the other hand, agree to CIF terms when they prefer a streamlined purchasing experience, as much of the logistic burden falls on the seller.

## Benefits of CIF

1. **Simplicity for Buyers:** It simplifies the buying process as the seller manages the majority of the shipping [logistics](../l/logistics.md).
2. **[Insurance](../i/insurance.md) [Assurance](../a/assurance.md):** It guarantees that the goods [will](../w/will.md) have minimum [insurance](../i/insurance.md) coverage during transit, providing a layer of protection for the buyer.
3. **Cost [Visibility](../v/visibility.md):** Buyers have a clear understanding of their financial liabilities since the cost of freight and [insurance](../i/insurance.md) is included in the [invoice](../i/invoice.md) price.

## Drawbacks of CIF

1. **Limited Control over Shipping:** Buyers may have limited control over the carrier selected by the seller and the terms of shipping, which can impact delivery times.
2. **[Insurance](../i/insurance.md) Limitations:** The [insurance](../i/insurance.md) arranged by the seller may not always cover all the risks the buyer wants to insure against, potentially leading to [gaps](../g/gap.md) in coverage.
3. **Potential for Higher Costs:** Sellers might add a markup on the freight and [insurance](../i/insurance.md) costs, making CIF potentially more expensive than alternatives where the buyer arranges these independently.

## Typical Use Cases

CIF terms are widely used in industries involving bulk commodities like [raw materials](../r/raw_materials.md), chemicals, and agricultural products, where the buyers often have established protocols to [handle](../h/handle.md) the incoming goods at their destination ports.

## Legal Implications

Failure to adhere to CIF terms can lead to disputes between the buyer and seller. Both parties must follow the stipulated [Incoterms](../i/incoterms.md) to ensure a smooth [transaction](../t/transaction.md). Disputes may arise around issues like:
- Misinterpretation of when the [risk](../r/risk.md) transfers from seller to buyer.
- Adequacy of [insurance](../i/insurance.md) coverage.
- Mismanagement of shipping schedules and documentation.

## An Illustrative Example

Consider a company in Brazil purchasing copper from a supplier in Canada under CIF terms. The supplier in Canada handles the cost of bringing the copper to a port in Brazil, purchasing [insurance](../i/insurance.md), and paying for the shipping. Once the copper is loaded onto the vessel in Canada, the [risk](../r/risk.md) transfers to the Brazilian company. If the vessel encounters a storm and the cargo is damaged, the Brazilian company would need to [handle](../h/handle.md) the [insurance claim](../i/insurance_claim.md) under the provided coverage, despite the shipment process being managed by the Canadian supplier up to that point.

## References to Specific Companies

While CIF is more of a term utilized in contractual dealings rather than being managed by specific companies, various [logistics](../l/logistics.md) and [insurance](../i/insurance.md) firms specialize in facilitating CIF shipments. For example:

- **Maersk** (https://www.maersk.com/): A global leader in container shipping and vessel operations, frequently involved in facilitating CIF shipments.
- **Lloyd’s of London** (https://www.lloyds.com/): Renowned for maritime [insurance](../i/insurance.md), providing policies that meet the CIF [insurance](../i/insurance.md) requirements.
- **C.H. Robinson** (https://www.chrobinson.com/): A global [logistics](../l/logistics.md) company that helps sellers and buyers manage CIF terms effectively.

Within the [scope](../s/scope.md) of international [trade](../t/trade.md), CIF remains an essential term for facilitating clear-cut responsibilities and reducing misunderstandings in global transactions. By understanding the nuances of CIF, parties can better negotiate contracts that protect their interests and streamline the shipping of goods across borders.

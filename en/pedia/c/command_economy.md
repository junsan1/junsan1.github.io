# Command Economy

A command [economy](../e/economy.md), also known as a planned [economy](../e/economy.md) or centralized [economy](../e/economy.md), is an economic system in which a central authority, typically the government, makes all crucial economic decisions. In contrast to [market](../m/market.md) economies where the forces of [supply](../s/supply.md) and [demand](../d/demand.md) determine production and pricing, command economies rely on a centrally planned structure to allocate resources and goals.

## Key Features of Command Economy

### Centralized Planning
One of the most defining characteristics of a command [economy](../e/economy.md) is centralized planning. A single central body, such as the government or a planning committee, outlines what products should be manufactured, the quantity, and the allocation of resources. This body usually creates multi-year plans (such as the Five-Year Plans in the Soviet Union) with broad or detailed specifications about economic activity.

### Government Ownership
Most, if not all, industries and means of production are owned and controlled by the government. This includes factories, farms, utilities, and even land in many cases. By consolidating ownership, the government exerts comprehensive control over economic activities.

### Motivation and Objectives
Unlike [market](../m/market.md) economies where [profit](../p/profit.md) motives drive businesses to act efficiently, command economies often pursue broader social or political goals. These may include achieving economic equality, guaranteeing employment, or redistributing [wealth](../w/wealth.md). In certain scenarios, the primary motivation can also be the [consolidation](../c/consolidation.md) of political control.

### Price Controls
In a command [economy](../e/economy.md), prices are typically set by the government rather than being determined by [market](../m/market.md) forces. These set prices aim to stabilize the [economy](../e/economy.md), control [inflation](../i/inflation.md), and ensure affordability of essential goods and services for the population.

## Historical Examples

### The Soviet Union
The Soviet command [economy](../e/economy.md) is one of the most prominent examples. The government, by means of the Gosplan (State Planning Committee), formulated comprehensive plans dictating virtually all aspects of [economic life](../e/economic_life.md). State enterprises were established, and private businesses were generally nonexistent. While the [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and sustainability of the Soviet command [economy](../e/economy.md) have been widely debated, it is instructive for both its successes in rapid [industrialization](../i/industrialization.md) and its ultimate collapse due to various inefficiencies and structural shortcomings.

### People's Republic of China
Following the Chinese Revolution, the [economy](../e/economy.md) adopted a command structure similar to that of the Soviet Union. The government devised plans and directly controlled many aspects of production and [distribution](../d/distribution.md). However, since the economic reforms initiated by Deng Xiaoping in the late 1970s, China has increasingly integrated [market](../m/market.md)-oriented reforms, while still retaining some elements of central planning.

### North Korea
North Korea remains one of the few modern states with a thoroughly command-oriented [economy](../e/economy.md). The government completely owns and controls [industry](../i/industry.md) and agriculture. Economic decisions are in the hands of the central government, with planning focusing heavily on military spending and maintaining the ruling regime.

## Strengths of Command Economies

### Economic Coordination and Planning
One of the primary strengths often cited for command economies is the capacity for high levels of economic coordination and planning. During times of crisis, such as wars or natural disasters, the central authority can swiftly repurpose resources to meet urgent needs. They can also direct investments toward long-term goals that may not be immediately profitable but are deemed essential for national interests.

### Addressing Inequality
Command economies can potentially address economic disparities by ensuring basic needs are met and [wealth](../w/wealth.md) is more evenly distributed across society. Since resources are allocated evenly based on planned objectives, it might mitigate class distinctions and ensure that all citizens have access to necessities.

### Focus on Collective Welfare
The driving motivation in command economies often centers around collective [welfare](../w/welfare.md). This focus can result in policies oriented towards improving education, healthcare, and other public services, addressing areas where [market](../m/market.md) economies might result in underinvestment due to the [profit](../p/profit.md) motive.

## Weaknesses of Command Economies

### Inefficiency
Command economies can suffer from significant inefficiencies due to the complexity of central planning. Lacking the mechanisms of pricing and competition inherent in [market](../m/market.md) systems, planning bodies often find it difficult to accurately assess [demand](../d/demand.md) and allocate resources effectively.

### Limited Innovation and Incentives
The incentives to innovate and improve economic performance may be weak in command economies since profits are not the primary motivators. Without competition to spur technological advancement and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md), these economies may stagnate over time.

### Bureaucratic Overreach
The centralization of economic decision-making tends to create an expansive bureaucratic apparatus. This [bureaucracy](../b/bureaucracy.md) can become ossified and resistant to change, fostering a culture of inefficiency and corruption. It may also serve the interests of the planners more than the population, leading to a disconnect between stated goals and actual outcomes.

## Modern Day Variations

### Mixed Economies
In the modern era, very few economies are purely command economies. Many countries have adopted a hybrid or mixed [economy](../e/economy.md) approach, integrating elements of both command and [market](../m/market.md) economies. For example, while state-owned enterprises remain prominent in countries like China, the government also allows for private businesses and [market](../m/market.md) mechanisms to operate within certain sectors.

### Emerging Technologies
Advances in technology, particularly in [data analytics](../d/data_analytics.md) and [artificial intelligence](../a/artificial_intelligence_in_trading.md), have sparked renewed discussions about the potential for more effective economic planning. The argument is that improved data collection and processing capabilities might allow modern states to overcome some of the traditional limitations of command economies by enabling more accurate and responsive planning mechanisms.

## Companies Operating in Economic Systems

### China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC)
[China National Petroleum Corporation](http://www.cnpc.com.cn/en/) is a state-owned enterprise and a significant player in China's command [economy](../e/economy.md). As an essential arm of the Chinese government in the [energy sector](../e/energy_sector.md), CNPC's activities are closely coordinated with national economic plans and policies. The company's presence exemplifies how a state entity can operate within a command [economy](../e/economy.md) framework, contributing to national development objectives.

## Conclusion

A command [economy](../e/economy.md) represents a radically different approach to economic organization compared to [market](../m/market.md) economies. While it offers the potential for high levels of coordination and [equity](../e/equity.md), it is also prone to significant inefficiencies and lacks the dynamic incentives present in more [market](../m/market.md)-oriented systems. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of this economic model is crucial not just for historical analysis but also for considering future policy design in an increasingly complex global [economy](../e/economy.md).

# Cost Basis

## Introduction

Cost basis is a fundamental concept in investing and taxation, particularly important for traders, investors, accountants, and tax professionals. It refers to the original value or purchase price of an asset, such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, real estate, or other investments, which is used to determine the capital gain or loss upon the sale of the asset. Understanding cost basis is crucial for accurate tax reporting and for making informed investment decisions.

## Calculation of Cost Basis

### Initial Purchase Price

The simplest form of cost basis is the initial purchase price of the asset. For example, if you buy 100 shares of a stock at $10 per share, your initial cost basis is $1,000.

### Additional Costs

The cost basis can include additional costs associated with acquiring the asset, such as:
- **Commissions and Fees:** Brokerage fees, transaction fees, and other charges related to the purchase.
- **Taxes:** Any taxes paid on the purchase.

### Adjustments to Cost Basis

Over time, the cost basis of an asset may need to be adjusted for various reasons:
- **Reinvested Dividends:** If dividends are reinvested to purchase more shares, these purchases increase the cost basis.
- **Stock Splits and Reverse Splits:** In a stock split, the number of shares increases while the price per share decreases, requiring an adjustment to the cost basis per share.
- **Corporate Actions:** Mergers, acquisitions, spin-offs, and other corporate actions can change the cost basis.

## Types of Cost Basis Methods

### First In, First Out (FIFO)

FIFO is a common method where the oldest shares purchased are considered to be sold first. This method is straightforward but may not always be tax-efficient.

### Last In, First Out (LIFO)

LIFO assumes that the most recently purchased shares are sold first. This method can be more tax-efficient in certain scenarios but is less commonly used.

### Specific Identification

Investors can specifically identify which shares are being sold. This method allows for strategic planning to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Average Cost

This method calculates the average cost of all shares owned. It is often used for mutual funds and ETFs and simplifies the calculation process.

## Tax Implications

### Short-Term vs. Long-Term Gains

- **Short-Term Capital Gains:** Gains from assets held for one year or less are typically taxed at higher ordinary income tax rates.
- **Long-Term Capital Gains:** Gains from assets held for more than one year are generally taxed at lower capital gains tax rates.

### Wash Sales

A wash sale occurs when an asset is sold at a loss and repurchased within 30 days before or after the sale. The loss is disallowed for tax purposes, and the disallowed loss is added to the cost basis of the repurchased asset.

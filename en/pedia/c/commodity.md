# Commodity

In the context of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and trading, commodities are [raw materials](../r/raw_materials.md) or primary agricultural products that can be bought and sold. These include items such as oil, gold, grains, sugar, and coffee. Commodities can be traded on regulated exchanges around the world and are essential for various economic sectors. Understanding the commodity [market](../m/market.md) is important for traders, investors, and corporations alike due to its impact on the global [economy](../e/economy.md) and individual financial portfolios.

## Types of Commodities

Commodities can be broadly categorized into two types:

### Hard Commodities
Hard commodities include natural resources that must be mined or extracted. Examples include:
- [Crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md)
- Natural gas
- Gold
- Copper

### Soft Commodities
Soft commodities typically refer to agricultural products or livestock. Examples include:
- Wheat
- Coffee
- Sugar
- Cattle

## Commodity Markets

Commodities are traded on specialized markets and exchanges. Some of the most notable ones include:

### Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)

## Commodity Futures

[Commodity futures](../c/commodity_futures.md) are standardized contracts to buy or sell a specific quantity of a commodity at a predetermined price at a specified date in the future. [Futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) are crucial for commodity trading as they provide a mechanism for [price discovery](../p/price_discovery.md) and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md).

### Key Elements of Futures Contracts
- **Contract Size**: Specifies the quantity of the commodity 
- **[Expiration Date](../e/expiration_date.md)**: The date when the contract is settled
- **Price**: The agreed-upon price for buying or selling the commodity

## Factors Influencing Commodity Prices

Commodity prices are influenced by a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to:

### Supply and Demand
The most fundamental [factor](../f/factor.md) affecting commodity prices is the balance of [supply](../s/supply.md) and [demand](../d/demand.md). When [demand](../d/demand.md) exceeds [supply](../s/supply.md), prices tend to rise, and vice-versa.

### Geopolitical Events
Events such as wars, [trade](../t/trade.md) disputes, and political instability can lead to significant changes in commodity prices. For example, tensions in the Middle East often affect oil prices.

### Economic Indicators
Indicators such as GDP growth, employment rates, and [inflation](../i/inflation.md) can influence commodity prices. Strong [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) typically leads to higher [demand](../d/demand.md) for [raw materials](../r/raw_materials.md).

### Weather Conditions
Weather significantly impacts agricultural commodities. Conditions such as droughts, floods, and hurricanes can lead to [supply](../s/supply.md) shortages and price spikes.

### Technological Advances
Technological innovations in extraction, production, or farming can lead to shifts in [supply](../s/supply.md), thereby affecting prices. For example, advances in shale oil extraction have significantly impacted the global oil [market](../m/market.md).

## Algorithmic Trading in Commodities

[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), or algo-trading, refers to the use of algorithms to automate [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). It is increasingly popular in [commodities trading](../c/commodities_trading.md) due to its [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and accuracy in executing trades.

### Advantages of Algorithmic Trading
- **Speed**: Algorithms can execute trades at higher speeds than humans.
- **Accuracy**: Minimizes the [risk](../r/risk.md) of human error.
- **[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md)**: Strategies can be tested on historical data to gauge their effectiveness.
- **Reduced [Transaction Costs](../t/transaction_costs.md)**: Efficient [execution](../e/execution.md) reduces [trading costs](../t/trading_costs.md).

### Common Strategies in Algo-Trading
- **[Trend Following](../t/trend_following.md)**: Algorithms identify and follow [market](../m/market.md) trends.
- **[Mean Reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md)**: These strategies assume prices [will](../w/will.md) revert to their mean over time.
- **[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**: Exploits price differences in the same [asset](../a/asset.md) across different markets.

### Notable Companies in Commodity Algo-Trading
- **Two Sigma Investments**: Uses advanced [data science](../d/data_science_in_trading.md) and technology to develop [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md).
  [Two Sigma Investments](https://www.twosigma.com/)
- **DRW Trading Group**: Engages in [proprietary trading](../p/proprietary_trading.md) and utilizes algorithmic strategies across various [asset](../a/asset.md) classes.

## Risks Associated with Commodity Trading

Trading commodities involves certain risks that traders must be aware of:

### Market Risk
Price [volatility](../v/volatility.md) can lead to substantial gains or losses. Commodities are known for their high [volatility](../v/volatility.md) compared to other [asset](../a/asset.md) classes.

### Liquidity Risk
Some commodities may have lower [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), meaning it can be difficult to enter or exit positions without significantly impacting the price.

### Leverage Risk
[Futures](../f/futures.md) and [options](../o/options.md) allow for leveraged positions, which can amplify gains but also increase the potential for significant losses.

### Regulatory Risk
Changes in regulations can impact commodities markets. For example, environmental regulations can affect the production and prices of certain commodities.

## Conclusion

Commodities are a vital component of global [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). They [offer](../o/offer.md) unique opportunities and risks for traders and investors. Understanding the diverse factors that influence commodity prices, the role of [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md), and the potential of [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) can provide a comprehensive foundation for engaging in this dynamic [market](../m/market.md). As technology and global [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md) continue to evolve, so too [will](../w/will.md) the strategies and frameworks for trading commodities.

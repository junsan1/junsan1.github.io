# Cup and Handle Pattern

The `Cup and [Handle](../h/handle.md)` pattern is a widely recognized chart pattern in [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md), primarily used in stock trading but applicable across various markets. It was popularized by [William J. O'Neil](../w/william_j._o'neil.md), founder of [Investor](../i/investor.md)'s [Business](../b/business.md) Daily, who detailed it in his book, "How to Make [Money](../m/money.md) in [Stocks](../s/stock.md)." This pattern is seen as a bullish continuation pattern and is often used by traders to identify potential buying opportunities.

## Understanding the Cup

The "cup" part of the pattern resembles a rounding bottom, indicating a period of [consolidation](../c/consolidation.md). The bottom of the cup is typically rounded rather than sharp, which differentiates it from other formations like the "[double bottom](../d/double_bottom.md)" pattern. The cup shape is formed due to the gradual change in [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) from bearish to bullish, which stabilizes over time before heading upwards.

Key characteristics of the cup:

1. **[Duration](../d/duration.md)**: The cup can form over several weeks to months and in some cases even years. The lengthier the time frame, the more reliable the pattern.
2. **Depth**: The depth of the cup should ideally be around 12 to 33% of the height of the preceding [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md).
3. **[Volume](../v/volume.md)**: [Volume](../v/volume.md) tends to decrease as the cup forms, reflecting the [consolidation](../c/consolidation.md) phase and the lack of strong selling pressure. As the price moves from the bottom towards the top of the cup, [volume](../v/volume.md) often increases.

## Understanding the Handle

The "[handle](../h/handle.md)" forms after the cup is completed and represents a short [consolidation](../c/consolidation.md) period â€“ typically a [retracement](../r/retracement.md) of the prevailing upward [trend](../t/trend.md). This is where the pattern gets its name due to its resemblance to a teacup.

Key characteristics of the [handle](../h/handle.md):

1. **[Duration](../d/duration.md)**: The [handle](../h/handle.md) can last anywhere from a week to several weeks and should angle slightly downward, indicating a final shakeout before the [breakout](../b/breakout.md).
2. **[Volume](../v/volume.md)**: [Volume](../v/volume.md) should contract during the formation of the [handle](../h/handle.md), indicating a lack of aggressive selling. As the price approaches the upper end of the [handle](../h/handle.md), [volume](../v/volume.md) typically picks up, confirming the [breakout](../b/breakout.md).
3. **Price Movement**: The [handle](../h/handle.md) should not drop more than 15% [retracement](../r/retracement.md) from the peak of the cup, ideally staying within 5 to 10%.

## Trading the Cup and Handle Pattern

### Entry Points

1. **[Breakout](../b/breakout.md) Point**: The most common entry point for traders is when the price breaks above the resistance level at the top of the cup with increased [volume](../v/volume.md). This resistance level acts as the [neckline](../n/neckline.md).

2. **Partial Entries**: Some traders might choose to enter a position during the formation of the [handle](../h/handle.md), especially if they believe that an early [breakout](../b/breakout.md) is imminent based on [volume](../v/volume.md) and other indicators.

### Stop-Loss Placement

1. **Below [Handle](../h/handle.md)**: A conservative stop-loss can be placed below the low of the [handle](../h/handle.md) to protect against false breakouts.

2. **Below Cup**: For more substantial leeway, traders might place a stop-loss below the bottom of the cup. While riskier, this method can avoid whipsaws in volatile markets.

### Price Target

A common approach to setting a target price following the [breakout](../b/breakout.md) is to measure the distance from the bottom of the cup to the [breakout](../b/breakout.md) point (the height of the cup) and then project that same distance from the [breakout](../b/breakout.md) point upwards. This is known as the `Measured Move`.

For instance:
- If the bottom of the cup is at $30, and the [breakout](../b/breakout.md) point is at $40, then the height is $10.
- The initial [price target](../p/price_target.md) would then be $40 + $10 = $50.

## Example of Cup and Handle Pattern

Let's consider a hypothetical example to illustrate the Cup and [Handle](../h/handle.md) pattern. Assume we're analyzing a stock called `XYZ` which has just entered a bullish [trend](../t/trend.md).

1. **Cup Formation**: The stock surges from $60 to $100 but then begins to gradually decline to a low of $80 before bouncing back to $100. 

2. **[Handle](../h/handle.md) Formation**: Following the recovery to $100, the stock retreats slightly to $95, consolidating within a narrow [range](../r/range.md).

3. **[Breakout](../b/breakout.md)**: The stock then breaks out above $100, accompanied by a noticeable increase in [volume](../v/volume.md), indicating a potential bullish [trend](../t/trend.md).

4. **Target Price**: Using the height of the cup (which is $100 - $80 = $20), the target price would be $100 + $20 = $120.

Here is a breakdown of these stages with actual values:

1. **Cup Low**: $80
2. **Cup High**: $100
3. **[Handle](../h/handle.md) Low**: $95
4. **[Breakout](../b/breakout.md) Point**: Slightly above $100
5. **Target Price**: $120

### Real-World Example

For a real-world example, consider a historical case like Amazon Inc. (AMZN). During a period from mid-2019 to early-2020, Amazon's stock exhibited a classic Cup and [Handle](../h/handle.md) pattern. The stock initially surged, then went through a significant decline, forming the 'cup.' Once it began recovering, there was a slight dip forming the '[handle](../h/handle.md)' before breaking out to new highs.

- **Cup Low**: $1650 
- **Cup High**: $2000
- **[Handle](../h/handle.md) Low**: $1900
- **[Breakout](../b/breakout.md) Point**: $2000
- **Target Price**: $2350 (Cup height of $350 added to [breakout](../b/breakout.md) point $2000)

## Conclusion

The Cup and [Handle](../h/handle.md) pattern is a reliable [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) tool that helps traders identify and [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on bullish continuations in a stock's price. By carefully analyzing the nuances of the cup and [handle](../h/handle.md) formations and incorporating proper [entry and exit strategies](../e/entry_and_exit_strategies.md) with sensible [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), traders can effectively utilize this pattern to boost their [trading performance](../t/trading_performance.md). It is crucial, however, to validate the pattern with additional indicators and [market](../m/market.md) conditions to mitigate [false signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md) and enhance trading accuracy.

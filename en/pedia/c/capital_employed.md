# Capital Employed

[Capital](../c/capital.md) Employed is a critical financial metric used to evaluate the [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and profitability of a company. It represents the total amount of [capital](../c/capital.md) that a company needs to generate profits and is an important [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of the [firm](../f/firm.md)'s [financial health](../f/financial_health.md). The term "[Capital](../c/capital.md) Employed" can be understood as the total resources that a company is using to generate profits.

## Definition and Scope

[Capital](../c/capital.md) Employed is calculated as:

\[
\text{[Capital](../c/capital.md) Employed} = \text{Total Assets} - \text{[Current Liabilities](../c/current_liabilities.md)}
\]

Alternatively, it can be calculated as:

\[
\text{[Capital](../c/capital.md) Employed} = \text{Fixed Assets} + \text{Working [Capital](../c/capital.md)}
\]

**Total Assets** include all the assets [listed](../l/listed.md) in the company's [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md), ranging from cash and investments to property, plant, and equipment. **[Current Liabilities](../c/current_liabilities.md)** include all the company's short-term financial [obligations](../o/obligation.md), such as accounts payable, [short-term debt](../s/short-term_debt.md), and other similar commitments.

## Components of Capital Employed

### 1. Fixed Assets
Fixed Assets are long-term [tangible assets](../t/tangible_asset.md) that a company uses to produce goods and services. They include machinery, buildings, land, and equipment. These assets are not expected to be converted into cash within a year.

### 2. Working Capital
Working [Capital](../c/capital.md) is the difference between a companyâ€™s [current assets](../c/current_assets.md) and [current liabilities](../c/current_liabilities.md). It represents the [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) available to a [business](../b/business.md). Positive working [capital](../c/capital.md) means the company can cover its short-term liabilities with short-term assets. 

\[
\text{Working [Capital](../c/capital.md)} = \text{[Current Assets](../c/current_assets.md)} - \text{[Current Liabilities](../c/current_liabilities.md)}
\]

## Importance of Capital Employed

### Measuring Efficiency
[Capital](../c/capital.md) Employed is a critical measure of a company's [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) in generating profits from its [capital](../c/capital.md). This metric is used by management and investors to assess how effectively the company's [capital](../c/capital.md) is being utilized.

### Investment Analysis
For investors, understanding how much [capital](../c/capital.md) is employed in the [business](../b/business.md) is crucial. It helps in determining the company's ability to generate returns from its [invested capital](../i/invested_capital.md).

### Strategic Decision Making
Management uses [capital](../c/capital.md) employed to make strategic decisions. For example, it helps them decide whether to invest in new projects, purchase assets, or expand operations.

## Capital Employed and Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)

One of the most important ratios that use [Capital](../c/capital.md) Employed is the [Return](../r/return.md) on [Capital](../c/capital.md) Employed (ROCE). ROCE measures a company's profitability and the [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) with which its [capital](../c/capital.md) is employed.

\[
\text{ROCE} = \left( \frac{\text{[Earnings](../e/earnings.md) Before [Interest](../i/interest.md) and Tax (EBIT)}}{\text{[Capital](../c/capital.md) Employed}} \right) \times 100
\]

A higher ROCE indicates a more efficient use of [capital](../c/capital.md). It is a valuable metric for comparing the performance of companies in the same [industry](../i/industry.md).

## Practical Example

Consider a company, ABC Corp, with the following financial statement figures:

- Total Assets: $500,000
- [Current Liabilities](../c/current_liabilities.md): $100,000
- Fixed Assets: $300,000
- [Current Assets](../c/current_assets.md): $200,000

Using the formula for [Capital](../c/capital.md) Employed:

\[
\text{[Capital](../c/capital.md) Employed} = \text{Total Assets} - \text{[Current Liabilities](../c/current_liabilities.md)} = \$500,000 - \$100,000 = \$400,000
\]

Alternatively,

\[
\text{[Capital](../c/capital.md) Employed} = \text{Fixed Assets} + \text{Working [Capital](../c/capital.md)} = \$300,000 + (\$200,000 - \$100,000) = \$400,000
\]

Both methods [yield](../y/yield.md) the same result.

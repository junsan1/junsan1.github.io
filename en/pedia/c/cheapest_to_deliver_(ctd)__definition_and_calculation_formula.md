# Cheapest to Deliver (CTD): Definition and Calculation Formula

## Definition of Cheapest to Deliver (CTD)

In the realm of fixed income and derivatives trading, the term "Cheapest to Deliver" (CTD) refers to the process of selecting the bond that minimizes the cost of fulfilling a futures contract obligation. The CTD bond is the specific bond that a short position holder in a futures contract will deliver to the long position holder at the maturity of the contract. The selection of the CTD bond is vital as it directly impacts the profitability and risk management of traders and portfolio managers.

The CTD concept is most commonly associated with interest rate futures, particularly Treasury futures contracts. These futures contracts are standard financial contracts that require the delivery of a specified amount of a government bond at a predetermined future date. For example, U.S. Treasury futures are standardized contracts traded on exchanges like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME Group) which is accessible via the following link: [CME Group](https://www.cmegroup.com).

## Importance of Cheapest to Deliver (CTD)

The CTD bond is crucial in the context of fixed income derivatives for several reasons:

1. **Cost Efficiency**: Identifying the CTD bond allows traders to minimize the cost incurred during the delivery process of a futures contract. By delivering the least expensive bond, traders can optimize their financial outcomes.

2. **Hedging**: Effective identification of the CTD bond is essential for hedging strategies. It enables traders to align their futures positions with the underlying cash bonds more accurately, thus mitigating basis risk.

3. **Market Liquidity**: The selection of CTD bonds influences market liquidity. Bonds that are frequently identified as CTD become more liquid in the secondary market due to the increased trading activity.

4. **Pricing and Valuation**: Accurate calculation of the CTD bond is vital for the pricing and valuation of futures contracts. It ensures that futures prices reflect the cost of acquiring the underlying bond that is cheapest to deliver.

## Calculation Formula for Cheapest to Deliver (CTD)

The determination of the CTD bond involves comparing the cost of delivering various eligible bonds into the futures contract. The CTD bond is the one with the lowest cost of delivery, calculated as follows:

\[ \text{CTD Price} = \frac{\text{Cash Price of Bond}}{\text{Conversion Factor}} + \text{Accrued Interest} \]

Where:
- **Cash Price of Bond**: The current market price of the bond.
- **Conversion Factor (CF)**: A factor provided by the exchange (e.g., CME Group) that adjusts the value of the bond to a standardized yield, allowing for fair comparison across different bonds. The conversion factor reflects the bond's market value relative to a notional bond with a fixed yield.
- **Accrued Interest**: The interest that has accumulated on the bond since the last coupon payment date up until the delivery date.

The bond with the lowest CTD Price is identified as the CTD bond. Let's break down the relevant components in detail:

### Cash Price of Bond

The cash price of the bond is the current trading price in the bond market. It includes the principal amount plus any market premium or discount.

### Conversion Factor (CF)

The conversion factor is calculated by the exchange and reflects the present value adjustment for different bond characteristics, such as coupon rate and time to maturity. The conversion factor standardizes the bond to a yield of 6% for U.S. Treasury futures, which allows for fair comparisons.

\[ \text{Conversion Factor} = \frac{\text{Factor Value}}{\text{Par Value}} \]

The factor value is influenced by the bondâ€™s coupon rate and maturity:
- **Higher Coupon Bonds**: Generally have higher conversion factors because they pay more interest.
- **Longer Maturity Bonds**: Lower conversion factors because they are subject to more interest rate risk.

### Accrued Interest

Accrued interest is calculated as the interest accumulated on the bond since the last coupon payment. This is done using the following formula:

\[ \text{Accrued Interest} = \frac{\text{Coupon Payment} \times \text{Days Since Last Coupon Payment}}{\text{Days in Coupon Period}} \]

### Example Calculation

Assume we have three bonds eligible for delivery into a Treasury futures contract. Here are their respective details:

1. **Bond A**: 
   - Cash Price: $101.00
   - Conversion Factor: 0.9785
   - Accrued Interest: $1.20

2. **Bond B**: 
   - Cash Price: $102.50
   - Conversion Factor: 0.9850
   - Accrued Interest: $1.50

3. **Bond C**: 
   - Cash Price: $100.75
   - Conversion Factor: 0.9700
   - Accrued Interest: $1.10

Now, calculate the CTD Price for each bond:

1. **Bond A:** 
\[ \text{CTD Price} = \frac{101.00}{0.9785} + 1.20 = 103.29 + 1.20 = 104.49 \]

2. **Bond B:**
\[ \text{CTD Price} = \frac{102.50}{0.9850} + 1.50 = 104.14 + 1.50 = 105.64 \]

3. **Bond C:**
\[ \text{CTD Price} = \frac{100.75}{0.9700} + 1.10 = 103.87 + 1.10 = 104.97 \]

From the calculations above, **Bond A** has the lowest CTD Price of 104.49 and is therefore identified as the Cheapest to Deliver.

## Factors Influencing CTD Selection

Several factors influence which bond becomes the CTD bond for a futures contract:

1. **Interest Rate Environment**: Changes in interest rates affect bond prices differently based on their coupons and maturities. During declining interest rate environments, higher coupon bonds might become cheaper to deliver.

2. **Yield Curve Shape**: The shape of the yield curve can impact the relative attractiveness of different bonds. For example, a steepening yield curve might make longer-maturity bonds cheaper to deliver.

3. **Market Liquidity and Supply**: The supply of specific bonds and their liquidity in the market can influence the CTD decision. Less liquid bonds might have higher transaction costs, affecting their overall delivery costs.

4. **Regulatory and Tax Considerations**: Specific regulations or tax treatments applicable to certain bonds might also affect their desirability as the CTD bond.

## Practical Applications of CTD Concept

### Arbitrage and Hedging Strategies

Traders and portfolio managers can engage in arbitrage and hedging strategies based on the CTD bond:

- **Basis Trading**: This strategy involves taking positions in cash bonds and offsetting futures contracts to exploit price discrepancies between the cash and futures markets.
  
- **Yield Curve Positioning**: Identifying the CTD bond helps in making strategic decisions based on anticipated movements in the yield curve.

- **Switcher Sales**: Executing switch trades where higher-priced bonds are sold, and the CTD bonds are purchased to optimize the delivery cost.

### Risk Management

Accurate identification of the CTD bond aids in effective risk management:

- **Margin Requirements**: By knowing the CTD bond, traders can anticipate margin requirements for futures positions more accurately.
  
- **Valuation**: It enables proper valuation of futures contracts, which is essential for marking-to-market and risk assessment.

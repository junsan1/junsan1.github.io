# Cash Advance

A cash advance is a short-[term loan](../t/term_loan.md) that is typically issued against a borrower's [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) or line of [credit](../c/credit.md). It allows cardholders to borrow a certain amount of cash immediately, usually up to a specific percentage of their [credit limit](../c/credit_limit.md). This financial tool is often used for urgent financial needs, such as unexpected expenses or emergencies, but comes with higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and fees compared to regular [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) purchases.

### How Cash Advances Work

To obtain a cash advance, you can either visit an ATM, a [bank](../b/bank.md), or request it online through your [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) provider’s website or app. You [will](../w/will.md) need to use your [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) and possibly a personal identification number (PIN) to access the cash. The amount you can borrow is usually capped and directly depends on your [credit card](../c/credit_card.md)’s cash advance limit, which is often lower than the total [credit limit](../c/credit_limit.md).

### Interest Rates and Fees

Cash advances come with higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates than standard [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) purchases. These rates can [range](../r/range.md) from 20% to 30% annually, depending on the [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) [issuer](../i/issuer.md). Additionally, cash advances typically incur a one-time [fee](../f/fee.md), which can be either a flat amount (e.g., $10 or $20) or a percentage of the amount borrowed (usually 2% to 5%).

1. **[Interest](../i/interest.md) Rates**: Unlike regular [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) charges that may have a grace period of up to 30 days, [interest](../i/interest.md) on cash advances begins accruing immediately from the date of the [transaction](../t/transaction.md).
2. **Fees**: Cardholders may be charged a processing [fee](../f/fee.md) by the ATM operator, in addition to the flat or percentage-based [fee](../f/fee.md) imposed by the [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) [issuer](../i/issuer.md).
3. **No Grace Period**: There is often no grace period for cash advances, meaning [interest](../i/interest.md) starts accumulating immediately after the [transaction](../t/transaction.md).

### Credit Card Statements and Minimum Payments

When you take out a cash advance, it [will](../w/will.md) appear on your [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) statement separately from regular purchases. The [minimum monthly payment](../m/minimum_monthly_payment.md) on your [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) might rise because of the added cash advance balance, which can affect your ability to pay off your total balance. 

### Cash Advance vs. Payday Loans

While both cash advances and payday loans are short-term borrowing [options](../o/options.md), they have distinct differences:

1. **Source**: Cash advances are obtained through a [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) [issuer](../i/issuer.md), while payday loans are usually provided by specialized payday lenders.
2. **[Credit](../c/credit.md) [Check](../c/check.md)**: [Credit card](../c/credit_card.md) cash advances typically require a good [credit score](../c/credit_score.md), whereas payday loans often do not require a [credit](../c/credit.md) [check](../c/check.md).
3. **[Repayment](../r/repayment.md) Periods**: Payday loans usually have very short [repayment](../r/repayment.md) periods, typically until your next paycheck, whereas cash advances can be repaid over several months.
4. **[Interest](../i/interest.md) Rates and Fees**: Payday loans generally come with even higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and fees compared to cash advances.

### Pros and Cons of Cash Advances

#### Pros

1. **Immediate Access to Funds**: Provides quick access to cash when you need it most.
2. **Convenience**: Available through ATMs, banks, or online platforms.
3. **No [Collateral](../c/collateral.md) Required**: Unlike secured loans, cash advances do not require any form of [collateral](../c/collateral.md).

#### Cons

1. **High [Interest](../i/interest.md) Rates**: Significantly higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates compared to other [credit](../c/credit.md) [options](../o/options.md).
2. **Fees**: Additional costs can add up quickly.
3. **Impact on [Credit Score](../c/credit_score.md)**: High [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and increased [debt](../d/debt.md) [load](../l/load.md) can negatively affect your [credit score](../c/credit_score.md).

### Responsible Use of Cash Advances

1. **[Emergency Fund](../e/emergency_fund.md)**: Ideally, use cash advances only for genuine emergencies when no other financial [options](../o/options.md) are available.
2. **Repay Quickly**: Aim to repay the cash advance as soon as possible to minimize [interest](../i/interest.md) accrual.
3. **[Budget](../b/budget.md) Carefully**: Ensure that you do not rely on cash advances for regular expenses, as this can lead to a cycle of [debt](../d/debt.md).

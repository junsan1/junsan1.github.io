# Closed Economy

A closed [economy](../e/economy.md) is an economic model that does not engage in international [trade](../t/trade.md); it is self-sufficient and does not [import](../i/import.md) or [export](../e/export.md) goods and services. This model stands in contrast to an [open](../o/open.md) [economy](../e/economy.md), where a country trades with other nations. Below are detailed discussions regarding the various aspects of a closed [economy](../e/economy.md).

## Definition of a Closed Economy

A closed [economy](../e/economy.md) is one that does not interact with other economies in terms of [trade](../t/trade.md), investment, or financial transactions. All goods and services consumed domestically are produced within the country's borders. Resources are allocated entirely by the domestic [market](../m/market.md), or under government direction, without external competition or influence.

## Features of a Closed Economy

1. **Self-Sufficiency**: All goods and services required by consumers are produced within the country. Agriculture, [industry](../i/industry.md), and services sectors are all developed to cater to domestic needs.
2. **No Imports and Exports**: There is no foreign [trade](../t/trade.md); the [economy](../e/economy.md) does not [export](../e/export.md) goods to other countries, nor does it [import](../i/import.md) goods from abroad.
3. **[Monetary Policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) Independence**: The nation retains full control over its monetary policies because there's no [risk](../r/risk.md) of [foreign exchange](../f/foreign_exchange.md) fluctuations.
4. **[Full Employment](../f/full_employment.md)**: The domestic [economy](../e/economy.md) may strive for [full employment](../f/full_employment.md) because the country's resources must be fully utilized without dependence on foreign markets.
5. **Domestic Investment Focus**: Investments are directed toward domestic projects without the influence of foreign direct investments (FDI) or multinational corporations.

## Advantages of a Closed Economy

1. **Protection from External Shocks**: With no dependency on international markets, the country is insulated from global economic fluctuations, such as financial crises or [commodity](../c/commodity.md) price [volatility](../v/volatility.md).
2. **Domestic [Industry](../i/industry.md) Promotion**: Encouragement for local industries to develop without competition from international firms. This can lead to innovation and a more [robust](../r/robust.md) industrial base.
3. **Economic Independence**: Greater control over the [economy](../e/economy.md) without being subjected to international markets, [trade](../t/trade.md) agreements, or diplomatic pressures.

## Disadvantages of a Closed Economy

1. **Lack of [Specialization](../s/specialization.md)**: Countries cannot benefit from specializing in the production of goods for which they have a [comparative advantage](../c/comparative_advantage_in_trading.md), potentially leading to less efficient resource use.
2. **Limited Consumer Choices**: Consumers have fewer [options](../o/options.md) because there are no imported goods. This can lead to lower quality or higher prices for goods and services.
3. **Potential for [Stagnation](../s/stagnation.md)**: Without the stimulus of foreign competition, domestic industries may become complacent, resulting in a lack of innovation and potentially slower [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md).
4. **Inefficiencies**: There may be inefficiencies due to lack of competition and the need to produce all types of goods domestically, even those for which the country is not suited.

## Historical Examples of Closed Economies

### Soviet Union

The Soviet Union operated one of the most notable closed economies from its establishment in 1922 until its dissolution in 1991. The Soviet government controlled all economic activities, and there was negligible international [trade](../t/trade.md). The [centrally planned economy](../c/centrally_planned_economy.md) aimed for self-sufficiency but faced issues like inefficiencies, lack of innovation, and eventual economic [stagnation](../s/stagnation.md).

### North Korea

North Korea remains one of the few examples of a largely closed [economy](../e/economy.md) in the modern world. The country has minimal [trade](../t/trade.md), a state-controlled [economy](../e/economy.md), and heavy reliance on minimal [foreign aid](../f/foreign_aid.md). The economic isolation has led to significant economic challenges, including food shortages and limited industrial development.

## Closed Economy in Theory vs. Practice

In theory, a perfectly closed [economy](../e/economy.md) doesn't exist in the contemporary world, as all nations engage in some form of international [trade](../t/trade.md). However, some countries have adopted policies that heavily restrict international [trade](../t/trade.md) and investment.

## Impact on Economic Indicators

1. **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)**: In a closed [economy](../e/economy.md), GDP is determined solely by domestic production and consumption.
2. **[Inflation](../i/inflation.md)**: The country has full control over [inflation](../i/inflation.md), as prices are not affected by international [price shocks](../p/price_shocks.md).
3. **[Unemployment](../u/unemployment.md)**: Employment levels depend entirely on local industries, without the benefits or risks of foreign labor markets.

## Modern Perspectives on Closed Economies

Most economists today see a closed [economy](../e/economy.md) as impractical and counterproductive for [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) and development. The benefits of [globalization](../g/globalization.md), international [trade](../t/trade.md), and investment are seen as essential for economic progress, innovation, and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md). While the closed [economy](../e/economy.md) remains a theoretical concept useful for certain economic analyses, in practice, nations are encouraged to participate in the global [economy](../e/economy.md) to realize their full potential.

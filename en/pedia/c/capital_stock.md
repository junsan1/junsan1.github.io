# Capital Stock

[Capital](../c/capital.md) stock represents the [shares](../s/shares.md) of ownership that have been issued by a [corporation](../c/corporation.md), which can be classified into two primary types: [common stock](../c/common_stock.md) and [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md). These [stocks](../s/stock.md) constitute a substantial part of a company's [equity](../e/equity.md), reflecting the ownership and the proportionate claim on a company's [earnings](../e/earnings.md) and assets.

# Types of Capital Stock

## Common Stock

[Common stock](../c/common_stock.md) is the most prevalent type of [capital](../c/capital.md) stock that companies [issue](../i/issue.md). Holders of [common stock](../c/common_stock.md) are typically entitled to vote at shareholders' meetings and receive dividends. The dividends, however, are not guaranteed and are issued at the company's discretion. Common stockholders are the last to claim residual assets in the event of company [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md), after [debt](../d/debt.md) holders and preferred stockholders.

### Key Features of Common Stock:
- Voting rights in corporate decisions
- Potential for [capital](../c/capital.md) growth through stock price appreciation
- [Dividend](../d/dividend.md) payments, which are variable and not guaranteed
- Residual claim on assets upon [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md)

## Preferred Stock

[Preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md) is another form of [equity](../e/equity.md) [capital](../c/capital.md) that combines features of both [common stock](../c/common_stock.md) and [debt](../d/debt.md). Preferred stockholders enjoy priority over common stockholders regarding [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payments and [asset](../a/asset.md) [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md). Dividends on [preferred stock](../p/preferred_stock.md) are typically fixed and must be paid before any dividends can be paid to common stockholders.

### Key Features of Preferred Stock:
- Fixed [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payments
- Higher claim on assets than common stockholders during [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md)
- Generally, no voting rights in corporate matters
- Some preferred [stocks](../s/stock.md) can be converted into common [stocks](../s/stock.md)

# Issuance of Capital Stock

Companies [issue](../i/issue.md) [capital](../c/capital.md) stock to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) for various purposes such as funding new projects, expanding operations, or paying off [debt](../d/debt.md). New [shares](../s/shares.md) can be issued through initial public offerings (IPOs) or secondary offerings.

## Initial Public Offering (IPO)

An IPO is when a company first offers its [shares](../s/shares.md) to the public. It is a significant step for a company as it transitions from being privately held to publicly traded. The process involves [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) by [investment banks](../i/investment_bank_(ib).md), regulatory filings, and [marketing](../m/marketing.md) to potential investors.

## Secondary Offering

A secondary [offering](../o/offering.md) occurs when additional [shares](../s/shares.md) are issued after the IPO. This can be either a dilutive [offering](../o/offering.md), where new [shares](../s/shares.md) are created and sold, leading to [dilution](../d/dilution.md) of existing [shares](../s/shares.md), or a non-dilutive [offering](../o/offering.md), where existing shareholders sell their [shares](../s/shares.md).

# Valuation of Capital Stock

The [value](../v/value.md) of [capital](../c/capital.md) stock is influenced by various factors including the company's [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md), growth prospects, [industry](../i/industry.md) trends, and overall [market](../m/market.md) conditions. Stock [valuation](../v/valuation.md) methods include:

## 1. Dividend Discount Model (DDM)

This model values a stock by estimating the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of its expected future dividends. The formula is:

\[ \text{P}_0 = \frac{\text{D}_1}{\text{r} - \text{g}} \]

Where:
- \(\text{P}_0\) = Current stock price
- \(\text{D}_1\) = [Dividend](../d/dividend.md) expected in the next period
- \(\text{r}\) = Required [rate of return](../r/rate_of_return.md)
- \(\text{g}\) = Growth rate of dividends

## 2. Price-Earnings (P/E) Ratio

The P/E ratio is a common metric used to [value stock](../v/value_stock.md), calculated by dividing the current stock price by the [earnings](../e/earnings.md) per share (EPS). It reflects investors' expectations of a company's future [earnings](../e/earnings.md) growth.

\[ \text{P/E Ratio} = \frac{\text{[Market Price](../m/market_price.md) per Share}}{\text{[Earnings](../e/earnings.md) per Share (EPS)}} \]

## 3. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

DCF [valuation](../v/valuation.md) estimates the [value](../v/value.md) of an investment based on its expected future cash flows, adjusted for the [time value](../t/time_value.md) of [money](../m/money.md). The cash flows are forecasted and discounted back to their [present value](../p/present_value.md) using a [discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md), typically the company's [weighted average](../w/weighted_average.md) [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md) (WACC).

# Capital Stock and Market Capitalization

[Market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md), or [market](../m/market.md) cap, is a measure of a company's overall [value](../v/value.md) as determined by the [stock market](../s/stock_market.md). It is calculated by multiplying the current stock price by the total number of outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md). [Market](../m/market.md) cap categories include:

- **Large-cap**: Companies with a [market](../m/market.md) cap of $10 billion or more
- **[Mid-cap](../m/mid-cap.md)**: Companies with a [market](../m/market.md) cap between $2 billion and $10 billion
- **Small-cap**: Companies with a [market](../m/market.md) cap between $300 million and $2 billion
- **Micro-cap**: Companies with a [market](../m/market.md) cap below $300 million

# Corporate Actions Affecting Capital Stock

Several corporate actions can impact the number of outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md) and the [value](../v/value.md) of [capital](../c/capital.md) stock, including:

## 1. Stock Splits

A [stock split](../s/stock_split.md) increases the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) in a company by dividing each existing share into [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [shares](../s/shares.md). This action is typically undertaken to make [shares](../s/shares.md) more affordable to investors without changing the company's overall [market value](../m/market_value.md). For example, in a 2-for-1 [stock split](../s/stock_split.md), each share is split into two, and the stock price is halved.

## 2. Stock Buybacks

Stock buybacks, or share repurchases, occur when a company buys back its outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md) from the [market](../m/market.md). This reduces the number of outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md), potentially increasing the stock price and [earnings](../e/earnings.md) per share (EPS).

## 3. Dividends

Dividends are payments made to shareholders from a company's [earnings](../e/earnings.md). Dividends can be issued in the form of cash or additional [shares](../s/shares.md) of stock (stock dividends). Regular dividends provide a steady [income](../i/income.md) stream to shareholders, while special dividends are one-time payments issued under extraordinary circumstances.

## 4. Mergers and Acquisitions

Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) can significantly impact [capital](../c/capital.md) stock. In a [merger](../m/merger.md), two companies combine to form a new entity, potentially leading to the issuance of new [shares](../s/shares.md). Acquisitions may involve a company purchasing another company, which could impact the stock price and [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) [equity](../e/equity.md).

# Impact of Economic Factors on Capital Stock

Various economic factors can influence the [value](../v/value.md) of [capital](../c/capital.md) stock, including:

## 1. Interest Rates

[Interest](../i/interest.md) rates have a direct impact on the cost of borrowing for companies. Higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates increase borrowing costs and can reduce corporate profits, negatively affecting stock prices. Conversely, lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates can stimulate investment and boost stock prices.

## 2. Inflation

[Inflation](../i/inflation.md) erodes [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) and can impact consumer [demand](../d/demand.md) and corporate [earnings](../e/earnings.md). High [inflation](../i/inflation.md) can lead to higher input costs for companies, squeezing [profit margins](../p/profit_margins_in_trading.md) and potentially lowering stock prices.

## 3. Economic Growth

[Economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) drives corporate profits and stock prices. During periods of economic [expansion](../e/expansion.md), companies generally experience higher revenues and [earnings](../e/earnings.md), positively impacting stock prices. Conversely, during recessions, stock prices may decline due to reduced consumer spending and lower corporate profits.

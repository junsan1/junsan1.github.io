# Chittagong Stock Exchange (CSE)

The Chittagong Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (CSE) is one of the two major stock exchanges in Bangladesh, located in the port city of Chittagong. It was established to facilitate a platform for companies and investors for trading equities and other financial instruments. Here is an in-depth look at various aspects of the Chittagong Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md), including its history, trading mechanisms, regulations, technological advancements, notable indices, and its role in the financial ecosystem of Bangladesh.

## History and Establishment

The Chittagong Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) was established on April 10, 1995, through a initiative undertaken by the local [business](../b/business.md) community and investors. The primary objectives behind establishing the CSE were to decentralize the financial [market](../m/market.md) and to promote regional [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) by [offering](../o/offering.md) a localized alternative to the Dhaka Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (DSE).

## Legal Framework and Regulations

The operations of the CSE are governed by the Bangladesh Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (BSEC), which is responsible for regulating and overseeing the securities [market](../m/market.md) in Bangladesh. The regulatory framework ensures that the [trading environment](../t/trading_environment.md) remains transparent, efficient, and fair for all participants.

## Trading Mechanism

### Trading Hours

CSE operates on all working days from Sunday to Thursday. The trading hours are usually from 10:00 AM to 2:30 PM BST.

### Trading System

CSE initially started with an [open outcry](../o/open_outcry.md) system and transitioned to a fully automated trading system (ATS) in June 1998, aiming to improve [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and [transparency](../t/transparency.md). The ATS follows a price-time priority mechanism, where orders are executed based on the [order](../o/order.md) of precedence among matching bids and asks.

### Order Types

CSE supports various types of orders, including:

- **[Market](../m/market.md) Orders**: Orders to buy or sell a specified amount of a [security](../s/security.md) at the best currently available price.
- **Limit Orders**: Orders to buy or sell a [security](../s/security.md) at a specified price or better.
- **Stop Orders**: Orders to buy or sell a [security](../s/security.md) once the price reaches a specified level.
- **Good-till-Canceled (GTC) Orders**: Orders that remain active until they are executed or manually canceled.

### Settlement Process

The settlement of trades is handled through a T+2 cycle, meaning that the [trade](../t/trade.md) is settled two [business](../b/business.md) days after the [transaction](../t/transaction.md) date. CSE works closely with the Central [Depository](../d/depository.md) Bangladesh Ltd. (CDBL) for the dematerialization and settlement of securities.

## Indices

### CSE All Share Price Index (CASPI)

The CASPI is one of the primary indicators of the overall performance of the CSE. It includes all [listed](../l/listed.md) securities and is calculated to represent the [market](../m/market.md)'s general [trend](../t/trend.md).

### CSE Selective Categories Index (CSCX)

The CSCX is a [weighted](../w/weighted.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md) that includes selected securities from various categories such as the [Manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) & Service, [Finance](../f/finance.md) & Leasing, [Insurance](../i/insurance.md), and Mutual Funds sectors. It is designed to reflect the performance of the top-tier companies on the [exchange](../e/exchange.md).

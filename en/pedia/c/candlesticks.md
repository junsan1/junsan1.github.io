# Candlesticks

Candlesticks in algorithmic trading are a graphical method of displaying price information that allows traders to analyze market price movements. This method was developed in Japan in the 17th century and is still widely used in modern financial markets.

## Types of Candlesticks

2. **Bearish Candlestick**: Indicates that the closing price is lower than the opening price.
3. **Doji**: A candlestick with opening and closing prices that are identical or nearly identical.

# Cash-and-Carry-Arbitrage

Cash-and-carry [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) is a [market](../m/market.md)-[neutral](../n/neutral.md) strategy that involves taking a long position in an [asset](../a/asset.md) (usually a [commodity](../c/commodity.md) or [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md)) and simultaneously taking a short position in a [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) on that same [asset](../a/asset.md). The goal of the strategy is to exploit the difference between the [spot price](../s/spot_price.md) (the current [market price](../m/market_price.md)) and the [futures](../f/futures.md) price of the [asset](../a/asset.md) to generate a [risk](../r/risk.md)-free [profit](../p/profit.md) at expiry. Cash-and-carry [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) is commonly used in the context of commodities like gold, oil, and stock indices, but it can also be applied to [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) products and currencies.

## Understanding Cash-and-Carry Arbitrage

The basic premise of cash-and-carry [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) is relatively straightforward. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Identify Discrepancy**: The [arbitrageur](../a/arbitrageur.md) identifies a discrepancy between the [spot price](../s/spot_price.md) of an [asset](../a/asset.md) and its corresponding [futures](../f/futures.md) price. 

2. **[Spot Market](../s/spot_market.md) Long Position**: The [trader](../t/trader.md) purchases the [asset](../a/asset.md) in the [spot market](../s/spot_market.md), holding the physical [commodity](../c/commodity.md) or [asset](../a/asset.md).

3. **[Futures Market](../f/futures_market.md) Short Position**: Simultaneously, the [trader](../t/trader.md) sells a [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) on the same [asset](../a/asset.md). This lock in a price at which they [will](../w/will.md) sell the [asset](../a/asset.md) in the future.

4. **Carry Costs**: Throughout the [holding period](../h/holding_period.md), the [trader](../t/trader.md) bears the carrying costs, which include storage, [insurance](../i/insurance.md), and [financing](../f/financing.md) costs. These must be considered when calculating the [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) [profit](../p/profit.md).

5. **Delivery/Expiry**: At the expiry of the [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md), the [trader](../t/trader.md) delivers the [asset](../a/asset.md) to satisfy the [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md), thus closing out both positions.

The [profit](../p/profit.md) from cash-and-carry [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) arises because the [futures](../f/futures.md) price typically includes a [premium](../p/premium.md) over the [spot price](../s/spot_price.md) due to the [time value](../t/time_value.md) of [money](../m/money.md), storage costs, and the cost of carry. When the [futures](../f/futures.md) price is sufficiently higher than the [spot price](../s/spot_price.md) plus carry costs, [arbitrage opportunities](../a/arbitrage_opportunities.md) exist.

## Key Components of Cash-and-Carry Arbitrage

### Spot Price
The [spot price](../s/spot_price.md) is the current [market price](../m/market_price.md) at which an [asset](../a/asset.md) is bought or sold for immediate delivery. In cash-and-carry [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), the [trader](../t/trader.md) buys the [asset](../a/asset.md) at the [spot price](../s/spot_price.md). 

### Futures Price
The [futures](../f/futures.md) price is the agreed upon price for future delivery of the [asset](../a/asset.md) through a [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md). The [futures](../f/futures.md) price is typically higher than the [spot price](../s/spot_price.md) due to carrying costs and the [time value](../t/time_value.md) of [money](../m/money.md).

### Carry Costs
Carry costs encompass all expenses involved in holding the [asset](../a/asset.md) until the [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md)'s expiry. They can include:
- **Storage Costs**: For physical commodities, storage facilities may charge fees for holding the [asset](../a/asset.md).
- **[Insurance](../i/insurance.md) Costs**: Depending on the [asset](../a/asset.md), [insurance](../i/insurance.md) may be necessary to protect against loss or damage.
- **[Financing](../f/financing.md) Costs**: If the [trader](../t/trader.md) borrows [money](../m/money.md) to buy the [asset](../a/asset.md), the [interest](../i/interest.md) on the [loan](../l/loan.md) is part of the carry costs.
- **Miscellaneous Costs**: Any other incidental costs associated with holding the [asset](../a/asset.md).

### Arbitrage Profit
[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) [profit](../p/profit.md) is the difference between the [futures](../f/futures.md) price and the sum of the [spot price](../s/spot_price.md) and carry costs. This can be expressed mathematically as:

\[ \text{Arbitrage Profit} = \text{Futures Price} - (\text{[Spot Price](../s/spot_price.md)} + \text{Carry Costs}) \]

## Practical Example

Consider an example involving gold:

1. A [trader](../t/trader.md) identifies that the current [spot price](../s/spot_price.md) of gold is $1,800 per ounce, while the [futures](../f/futures.md) price for delivery in three months is $1,850 per ounce.
2. The [trader](../t/trader.md) purchases 10 ounces of gold at the [spot price](../s/spot_price.md), totaling $18,000.
3. The [trader](../t/trader.md) simultaneously sells a three-month [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) for 10 ounces of gold at the [futures](../f/futures.md) price, yielding $18,500.
4. The carrying costs over three months (including storage, [insurance](../i/insurance.md), and [financing](../f/financing.md)) amount to $100.

At the expiration of the [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md), the [trader](../t/trader.md) delivers the 10 ounces of gold to settle the [futures](../f/futures.md) position. The [profit](../p/profit.md) is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Arbitrage Profit} = \text{\$18,500 (Futures Price)} - \{\text{\$18,000 ([Spot Price](../s/spot_price.md))} + \text{\$100 (Carry Costs)}\} = \$400 \]

## Market Conditions Favoring Cash-and-Carry Arbitrage

### Contango
Cash-and-carry [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) is most effective in a [market](../m/market.md) condition known as [contango](../c/contango.md), where the [futures](../f/futures.md) prices are higher than the spot prices. [Contango](../c/contango.md) generally occurs when there is an expectation that the price of an [asset](../a/asset.md) [will](../w/will.md) rise over time or when carrying costs are significant. In such scenarios, [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) [trade](../t/trade.md) at a [premium](../p/premium.md) to spot prices, making [arbitrage opportunities](../a/arbitrage_opportunities.md) feasible.

### Backwardation
In [backwardation](../b/backwardation.md), [futures](../f/futures.md) prices are lower than spot prices. This condition can occur due to short-term [supply](../s/supply.md) shortages or strong immediate [demand](../d/demand.md) for the [asset](../a/asset.md). While cash-and-carry [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) is less common in [backwardation](../b/backwardation.md), a related strategy called reverse cash-and-carry [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) may be employed. This involves shorting the [asset](../a/asset.md) in the [spot market](../s/spot_market.md) and going long in the [futures market](../f/futures_market.md).

## Risk Management

### Market Risks
Despite being considered a [risk](../r/risk.md)-free strategy, there are [market](../m/market.md) risks to consider. Price fluctuations in the [spot market](../s/spot_market.md) prior to [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) expiration could affect the potential profits or losses.

### Basis Risk
[Basis risk](../b/basis_risk.md) arises from the change in the difference between the spot and [futures](../f/futures.md) prices between the initiation and expiration of the [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md). Unanticipated changes can affect profits.

### Liquidity Risk
[Liquidity risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md) pertains to the ability to enter and exit positions in the spot or [futures market](../f/futures_market.md) without significantly impacting prices. If the markets are not sufficiently [liquid](../l/liquid.md), the [trader](../t/trader.md) might face difficulties.

### Counterparty Risk
[Counterparty risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md) in [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) stems from the possibility that the party on the other side of the contract may [default](../d/default.md) on the agreement. Regulated exchanges mitigate this [risk](../r/risk.md) by acting as intermediaries.

## Computational and Algorithmic Approaches

[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) has enhanced the [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and scale at which [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) strategies like cash-and-carry can be executed. High-frequency trading (HFT) firms and quant traders develop complex algorithms to identify and exploit [arbitrage opportunities](../a/arbitrage_opportunities.md) across [multiple](../m/multiple.md) markets and [asset](../a/asset.md) classes.

**Examples of Algorithmic Approaches**:

1. **[Price Discovery](../p/price_discovery.md) Algorithms**: These algorithms continuously scan [multiple](../m/multiple.md) exchanges and trading venues for price discrepancies between spot and [futures](../f/futures.md) prices.
2. **[Execution Algorithms](../e/execution_algorithms.md)**: These are designed to carry out the trades in the spot and [futures](../f/futures.md) markets efficiently, minimizing [market](../m/market.md) impact and maximizing [execution](../e/execution.md) speed.
3. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md) Algorithms**: Algorithms that actively monitor carrying costs, [market](../m/market.md) conditions, and other factors to mitigate risks associated with [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) trades.

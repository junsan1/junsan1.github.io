# Capital Leases

[Capital](../c/capital.md) leases, sometimes known as [finance](../f/finance.md) leases, are a type of lease agreement in which the [lessee](../l/lessee.md) (the user of the [asset](../a/asset.md)) assumes some of the risks and benefits of ownership. This type of lease is treated as an [asset](../a/asset.md) and a corresponding [liability](../l/liability.md) on the [lessee](../l/lessee.md)'s [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md), making it fundamentally different from operating leases, which do not appear on the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md). 

## Definition and Characteristics

A [capital](../c/capital.md) lease is a lease agreement that is similar in nature to a purchase. The [Financial Accounting](../f/financial_accounting.md) Standards Board (FASB) has outlined specific criteria that categorize a lease as a [capital](../c/capital.md) lease:

1. **Ownership Transfer:** The lease transfers ownership of the [asset](../a/asset.md) to the [lessee](../l/lessee.md) by the end of the lease term.
2. **Bargain Purchase Option:** The lease contains an option to purchase the [asset](../a/asset.md) at a bargain price at the end of the lease term.
3. **Lease Term:** The term of the lease is equal to 75% or more of the estimated [economic life](../e/economic_life.md) of the [asset](../a/asset.md).
4. **[Present Value](../p/present_value.md):** The [present value](../p/present_value.md) of the minimum [lease payments](../l/lease_payments.md) amounts to at least 90% of the [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) of the leased [asset](../a/asset.md).

If any of these criteria are met, the lease is classified as a [capital](../c/capital.md) lease. It is crucial to understand these criteria as they determine the [accounting](../a/accounting.md) treatment of the lease.

## Accounting for Capital Leases

The [accounting](../a/accounting.md) treatment for [capital](../c/capital.md) leases requires that the [lessee](../l/lessee.md) recognize both an [asset](../a/asset.md) and a [liability](../l/liability.md) on its [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) at the inception of the lease. The [value](../v/value.md) recognized is typically the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of the minimum [lease payments](../l/lease_payments.md). Here are the essential steps:

1. **Initial Recognition:** 
   - **[Asset](../a/asset.md):** The leased [asset](../a/asset.md) is recognized on the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) as an [asset](../a/asset.md). 
   - **[Liability](../l/liability.md):** A corresponding [liability](../l/liability.md) is recognized for the obligation to make [lease payments](../l/lease_payments.md) over the lease term.

2. **[Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md):** 
   - The leased [asset](../a/asset.md) is depreciated over its [useful life](../u/useful_life.md). The [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) method and period should be consistent with that of other owned assets. If there is a transfer of ownership at the end of the lease term, the [asset](../a/asset.md) is depreciated over its [economic life](../e/economic_life.md). Otherwise, it is depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or its [economic life](../e/economic_life.md).

3. **[Interest Expense](../i/interest_expense.md):** 
   - Over time, the [liability](../l/liability.md) is decreased by the [lease payments](../l/lease_payments.md), and [interest expense](../i/interest_expense.md) is recognized on the lease [liability](../l/liability.md).

4. **[Lease Payments](../l/lease_payments.md):** 
   - [Lease payments](../l/lease_payments.md) are divided between reducing the [liability](../l/liability.md) and recognizing [interest expense](../i/interest_expense.md). The [interest expense](../i/interest_expense.md) is higher at the beginning of the lease term and decreases as the [principal](../p/principal.md) amount of the lease [liability](../l/liability.md) is reduced.

## Benefits and Drawbacks

### Benefits:
1. **Control Over [Asset](../a/asset.md):** The [lessee](../l/lessee.md) gets more control over the [asset](../a/asset.md) compared to operating leases.
2. **Tax Benefits:** [Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) of the leased [asset](../a/asset.md) and [interest expense](../i/interest_expense.md) are tax-deductible.
3. **[Balance Sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) [Capitalization](../c/capitalization.md):** Helps accurately reflect the company’s assets and liabilities, increasing [transparency](../t/transparency.md) to investors and creditors.

### Drawbacks:
1. **Complex [Accounting](../a/accounting.md):** More complex than operating leases with the need to split [lease payments](../l/lease_payments.md) between [interest](../i/interest.md) and [principal](../p/principal.md).
2. **Impact on [Financial Ratios](../f/financial_ratios.md):** Can affect various [financial ratios](../f/financial_ratios.md) such as [debt](../d/debt.md)-to-[equity](../e/equity.md) ratio, making the company appear more leveraged.

## Financial Impact

The financial implications of a [capital](../c/capital.md) lease include its effect on a company's [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md), [income statement](../i/income_statement.md), and [cash flow statement](../c/cash_flow_statement.md):

- **[Balance Sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md):** Shows the leased [asset](../a/asset.md) and [liability](../l/liability.md), impacting the company’s [leverage](../l/leverage.md) and [asset](../a/asset.md) [turnover ratios](../t/turnover_ratios.md).
- **[Income Statement](../i/income_statement.md):** [Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) and [interest expense](../i/interest_expense.md) are recognized instead of lease [expense](../e/expense.md), impacting net [income](../i/income.md) differently over the lease term.
- **[Cash Flow Statement](../c/cash_flow_statement.md):** Operating [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) improves as [lease payments](../l/lease_payments.md) are split into [interest](../i/interest.md) (operating) and [principal](../p/principal.md) ([financing](../f/financing.md)).

## Transition to ASC 842

The [accounting](../a/accounting.md) landscape for leases changed with the introduction of ASC 842 by the FASB, effective for public companies from 2019 and non-public entities from 2020. ASC 842 supersedes the previous lease [accounting](../a/accounting.md) standard, ASC 840. The key change under ASC 842 is that it requires nearly all leases to be recognized on the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md), including operating leases, though the [accounting](../a/accounting.md) distinction between [capital](../c/capital.md) (now called [finance](../f/finance.md) leases) and operating leases remains.

## Examples of Capital Lease Structures

Consider a company that leases a piece of machinery with a [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) of $1,000,000 for ten years. The lease agreement mandates yearly payments of $120,000, and the machine's estimated [economic life](../e/economic_life.md) is 15 years. At the end of the lease term, the company has the option to purchase the machinery at a bargain price of $50,000. 

Based on this information, the lease would likely be classified as a [capital](../c/capital.md) lease because it meets several criteria:
1. **Bargain Purchase Option:** The purchase option at the end of the lease term is at a bargain price.
2. **Lease Term:** The term (10 years) is over 75% of the machine's [economic life](../e/economic_life.md) (15 years).

## Lease vs. Buy Decision

Businesses often face the decision of whether to lease or buy an [asset](../a/asset.md). This decision hinges on various financial and operational considerations:

- **Leasing Advantages:** Preserves [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) and allows for easier upgrades.
- **Buying Advantages:** Provides ownership benefits and may be financially advantageous in the long term.

A thorough [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md) comparing the net [present value](../p/present_value.md) (NPV) of leasing versus buying is often conducted to aid this decision.

## Capital Lease Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Delta Airlines

[Delta](../d/delta.md) Airlines has extensively used [capital](../c/capital.md) leases to [finance](../f/finance.md) its fleet. Given the substantial cost of aircraft, leasing allows the company to utilize these high-[value](../v/value.md) assets without the upfront expenditure, while also reflecting the planes as assets on the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md). More information can be found on [Delta Airline's investor relations page](https://ir.delta.com).

### Case Study 2: AT&T

AT&T has leveraged [capital](../c/capital.md) lease [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for various network and [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md)-related assets. This approach enables the company to maintain a [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) that better reflects its [asset](../a/asset.md) utilization and [obligations](../o/obligation.md).

## Conclusion

[Capital](../c/capital.md) leases [offer](../o/offer.md) a compelling option for companies that need to use high-[value](../v/value.md) assets without the need to immediately purchase them. By recognizing both the [asset](../a/asset.md) and associated [liability](../l/liability.md) on the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md), companies can benefit from control over the [asset](../a/asset.md) and potential tax advantages. However, the complexity of [accounting](../a/accounting.md) and impact on [financial ratios](../f/financial_ratios.md) necessitates careful consideration. The transition to ASC 842 further underscores the importance of understanding and accurately reporting [capital](../c/capital.md) leases, aligning financial reporting with economic realities.

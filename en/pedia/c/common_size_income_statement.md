# Common Size Income Statement

A common size [income statement](../i/income_statement.md) is a financial statement that presents all items of a company’s [income statement](../i/income_statement.md) as a percentage of total [revenue](../r/revenue.md). This format allows for easier comparison between different periods and with other companies, regardless of size or [currency](../c/currency.md) differences. It is a valuable tool for [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md), enabling analysts and investors to identify trends, assess [financial health](../f/financial_health.md), and make informed decisions.

## Structure of a Common Size Income Statement

The common size [income statement](../i/income_statement.md) breaks down each line item on the [income statement](../i/income_statement.md) into a percentage of total [revenue](../r/revenue.md). This approach standardizes the financial data, providing a clear picture of how each cost and [profit](../p/profit.md) element contributes to the overall [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md). Below is a general structure of what a common size [income statement](../i/income_statement.md) might look like:

### Revenues

- **Total [Revenue](../r/revenue.md)** (100%)
  - Often broken down further into segments such as sales, services, and other operating incomes.

### Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)

- **COGS** (% of Total [Revenue](../r/revenue.md))
  - Represents the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by a company.

### Gross Profit

- **[Gross Profit](../g/gross_profit.md)** (% of Total [Revenue](../r/revenue.md))
  - Calculated as Total [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) minus Cost of Goods Sold. 

### Operating Expenses

- **Selling, General and [Administrative Expenses](../a/administrative_expenses.md) (SG&A)** (% of Total [Revenue](../r/revenue.md))
  - Includes all costs that are not directly tied to the production process, such as [marketing](../m/marketing.md) expenses, administrative salaries, and rent.

- **[Research and Development (R&D) Expenses](../r/research_and_development_(r&d)_expenses.md)** (% of Total [Revenue](../r/revenue.md))
  - Funds allocated towards the creation of new products or improvement of existing ones.

### Operating Income

- **[Operating Income](../o/operating_income.md)** (% of Total [Revenue](../r/revenue.md))
  - Derived after subtracting operating expenses from [gross profit](../g/gross_profit.md). This metric is crucial as it indicates the [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and profitability of the core [business](../b/business.md) operations.

### Other Income and Expenses

- **[Interest Expense](../i/interest_expense.md)** (% of Total [Revenue](../r/revenue.md))
  - The cost incurred by an entity for borrowed funds.

- **[Income](../i/income.md) [Tax Expense](../t/tax_expense.md)** (% of Total [Revenue](../r/revenue.md))
  - [Taxes](../t/taxes.md) imposed on the company’s [earnings](../e/earnings.md).

### Net Income

- **Net [Income](../i/income.md)** (% of Total [Revenue](../r/revenue.md))
  - The final line that indicates the company’s total [profit](../p/profit.md) after all expenses have been deducted from total [revenue](../r/revenue.md).

## Importance and Benefits

### Easier Comparisons

- **Inter-Company Comparisons:**
  Common size statements enable analysts to compare companies of different sizes by standardizing financial data into percentages. This is valuable for benchmarking [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) against [industry](../i/industry.md) peers.

- **Intra-Company Comparisons:**
  They also facilitate comparison across different periods for the same company. By examining changes in specific [expense](../e/expense.md) categories as a percentage of [revenue](../r/revenue.md), analysts can identify trends and [operational efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md).

### Identifying Trends and Problems

- **[Trend Analysis](../t/trend_analysis.md):**
  Analysts can use common size [income](../i/income.md) statements to track changes in [expense](../e/expense.md) ratios over time, allowing them to spot emerging trends that might not be visible in absolute figures.

- **Early Warning Signals:**
  Increasing costs as a percentage of total [revenue](../r/revenue.md) may signal inefficiencies or potential [financial distress](../f/financial_distress.md), prompting deeper investigation.

### Simplified Analysis

- **Eliminating the Size [Factor](../f/factor.md):**
  Since all values are expressed as a percentage of revenues, it eliminates the impact of company size on the analysis, making it easier to focus on [operational efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md) and profitability.

## Practical Applications

### Financial Analysis for Investors

Investors frequently use common size [income](../i/income.md) statements to compare potential investment opportunities. By examining the [expense](../e/expense.md) structure and [profitability ratios](../p/profitability_ratios.md), they can identify companies with superior [operational efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md) and growth potential.

### Managerial Insights

Company management can use common size [income](../i/income.md) statements to evaluate the effectiveness of their strategies and operations. It helps in identifying areas where costs can be optimized and revenues can be enhanced.

### Investment Banking

Investment bankers often [leverage](../l/leverage.md) common size [income](../i/income.md) statements during mergers and acquisitions (M&A) to assess the [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) of target companies and identify potential synergies.

## Example

To illustrate, let’s consider an example of a hypothetical company, ABC Corp:

| **Item** | **Amount (in USD)** | **Common Size (%)** |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **[Revenue](../r/revenue.md)**              | 1,000,000 | 100.0% |
| **Cost of Goods Sold**   | 600,000   | 60.0%  |
| **[Gross Profit](../g/gross_profit.md)**         | 400,000   | 40.0%  |
| **Operating Expenses**   | 200,000   | 20.0%  |
| **[Operating Income](../o/operating_income.md)**     | 200,000   | 20.0%  |
| **[Interest Expense](../i/interest_expense.md)**     | 10,000    | 1.0%   |
| **Net [Income](../i/income.md)**           | 150,000   | 15.0%  |

This common size [income statement](../i/income_statement.md) shows that ABC Corp spends 60% of its [revenue](../r/revenue.md) on COGS, resulting in a [gross profit margin](../g/gross_profit_margin.md) of 40%. After [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for operating expenses, the [operating income](../o/operating_income.md) stands at 20%. Ultimately, the net [income](../i/income.md) as a percentage of total [revenue](../r/revenue.md) is 15%.

## Conclusion

The common size [income statement](../i/income_statement.md) is a powerful analytical tool that offers several advantages for comparing [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) across companies and periods. By converting absolute financial data into percentages of total [revenue](../r/revenue.md), it allows for more straightforward analysis and identification of trends and inefficiencies. This tool is indispensable for investors, analysts, and company management seeking to make informed financial decisions.

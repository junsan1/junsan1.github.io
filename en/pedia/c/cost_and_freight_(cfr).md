# Cost and Freight (CFR)

Cost and Freight (CFR) is a [trade](../t/trade.md) term that is commonly used in international shipping. Under this term, the seller is responsible for covering the costs and freight necessary to transport the goods to the destination port specified by the buyer. However, the [risk](../r/risk.md) of loss or damage to the goods, as well as any additional costs, transfer from the seller to the buyer once the goods are loaded onto the shipping vessel. CFR is one of the [Incoterms](../i/incoterms.md) (International Commercial Terms) created by the International Chamber of [Commerce](../c/commerce.md) (ICC) to standardize terms and conditions in international [trade](../t/trade.md).

## Key Responsibilities

### Seller's Responsibilities
1. **Cost of Goods:** The seller must bear the cost of the goods being shipped.
2. **[Export](../e/export.md) Duties and [Taxes](../t/taxes.md):** The seller must [handle](../h/handle.md) and pay all duties, [taxes](../t/taxes.md), and other charges related to exporting the goods from the country of origin.
3. **Freight Charges:** The seller must cover the cost of transporting the goods to the destination port.
4. **Shipping and Handling:** The seller is in charge of loading the goods onto the vessel and ensuring that they are safely stowed away.
5. **Shipping Documents:** The seller must provide the buyer with all necessary shipping documents, including the [invoice](../i/invoice.md), packing list, [bill of lading](../b/bill_of_lading.md), and any other documents required by the buyer.

### Buyer's Responsibilities
1. **[Import](../i/import.md) Duties and [Taxes](../t/taxes.md):** The buyer is responsible for any [import](../i/import.md) duties, [taxes](../t/taxes.md), and customs clearance procedures at the destination port.
2. **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Transfer:** The [risk](../r/risk.md) of loss, damage, or additional costs transfers to the buyer once the goods are loaded onto the vessel.
3. **[Insurance](../i/insurance.md):** The buyer is responsible for arranging and paying for any [insurance](../i/insurance.md) coverage necessary from the point the goods are loaded on the vessel.
4. **Final Transport:** The buyer must manage and pay for the final stage of transport from the destination port to the final destination.

## Documentation

### Bill of Lading
A [bill of lading](../b/bill_of_lading.md) is one of the essential documents in a CFR agreement. It serves as a receipt for the cargo and a contract for the carriage of goods. It also constitutes a document of title that can be transferred, making it a crucial document in a CFR [transaction](../t/transaction.md). 

### Commercial Invoice
The commercial [invoice](../i/invoice.md) is another critical document that details the cost of the goods and specifies the terms of the [sale](../s/sale.md). It is used for customs clearance at both the [export](../e/export.md) and [import](../i/import.md) stages.

### Packing List
The packing list is a document that provides detailed information on the contents of the shipment, ensuring that the buyer and customs officials can verify the contents.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages for Sellers
1. **Control Over Shipping:** The seller can negotiate freight charges and choose the carrier, which can result in better control over the shipping process and costs.
2. **Simplified [Export](../e/export.md) Procedures:** As the seller handles all the [export](../e/export.md) procedures, it simplifies the [export](../e/export.md) process for the buyer.
3. **Competitive Edge:** [Offering](../o/offering.md) CFR terms can make goods more attractive to international buyers, as they don't have to worry about arranging international freight.

### Advantages for Buyers
1. **Cost [Visibility](../v/visibility.md):** Buyers get a clear understanding of the total cost of goods, including freight charges, upfront.
2. **Less [Export](../e/export.md) Hassle:** Buyers don’t have to manage [export](../e/export.md) procedures, which can be complex and time-consuming.
3. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md):** Buyers can manage the [risk](../r/risk.md) of damage or loss more effectively by arranging their own [insurance](../i/insurance.md) once the goods are onboard.

### Disadvantages for Sellers
1. **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Transfer:** Once the goods are loaded on the vessel, the [risk](../r/risk.md) transfers to the buyer, which means the seller has less control over the goods during transit.
2. **Freight Costs:** Sellers might incur higher freight costs, especially if they are located far from the port of loading.

### Disadvantages for Buyers
1. **[Risk](../r/risk.md) During Transit:** The buyer bears the [risk](../r/risk.md) of damage or loss once the goods are loaded on the vessel, making [insurance](../i/insurance.md) crucial.
2. **Final Delivery:** Buyers have to arrange final delivery from the destination port to the final destination, which can be complex and costly.

## Practical Examples and Case Studies

### Case Studies
Several real-world examples highlight the use of CFR terms in international [trade](../t/trade.md). For instance, consider a company based in Germany that sells industrial machinery to a buyer in Brazil. The seller uses CFR terms to cover the cost and freight to the port of Santos in Brazil. The [risk](../r/risk.md) transfers to the buyer once the machinery is loaded onto the vessel at Hamburg port. The buyer then arranges for [insurance](../i/insurance.md) and manages the final transport from Santos port to their warehouse in São Paulo.

Another example involves an exporter of electronics in China shipping products to a buyer in South Africa. By using CFR terms, the seller covers the cost and freight to Durban port, after which the [risk](../r/risk.md) transfers to the buyer who then handles customs clearance, [insurance](../i/insurance.md), and final delivery.

## Comparison with Other Incoterms

### CIF (Cost, Insurance, and Freight)
CFR is often compared with CIF, another common Incoterm. The primary difference between the two is that under CIF, the seller is also responsible for purchasing [insurance](../i/insurance.md) for the goods in transit, providing a more comprehensive cover for the buyer until the goods reach the destination port.

### FOB (Free on Board)
FOB is another Incoterm that differs significantly from CFR. Under FOB, the [risk](../r/risk.md) and cost transfer to the buyer once the goods are loaded on the vessel at the port of shipment. Unlike CFR, the buyer is responsible for all shipping costs and procedures once the goods are on board.

### EXW (Ex Works)
EXW is another term where the seller's responsibilities are kept to a minimum. The buyer takes on nearly all responsibilities, including transportation, [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), and cost, starting at the point of origin.

## Conclusion

Cost and Freight (CFR) is a versatile and widely used Incoterm in international shipping. Understanding both the advantages and disadvantages associated with CFR can help both sellers and buyers make informed decisions in international [trade](../t/trade.md). By specifying the responsibilities clearly, CFR facilitates smoother transactions and helps in mitigating risks and managing costs effectively. Knowing how CFR operates compared to other [Incoterms](../i/incoterms.md) can further streamline international trading activities and foster better [business](../b/business.md) relationships.

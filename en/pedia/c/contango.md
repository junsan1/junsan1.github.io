# Contango

Contango is a term used in [finance](../f/finance.md) to describe a [market](../m/market.md) situation where the [futures](../f/futures.md) price of a [commodity](../c/commodity.md) is higher than the [spot price](../s/spot_price.md). This condition indicates that investors are willing to pay more for a [commodity](../c/commodity.md) at some point in the future than they are willing to pay for it today. The term is commonly used in the context of [commodity](../c/commodity.md) markets but can also apply to financial instruments and indices. Contango reflects traders' expectations about future price movements, storage costs, and other factors. This phenomenon contrasts with "[backwardation](../b/backwardation.md)," where the [futures](../f/futures.md) price is lower than the [spot price](../s/spot_price.md).

## Understanding Contango

To better understand contango, consider the following key concepts:

### Spot Price and Futures Price

- **[Spot Price](../s/spot_price.md):** The current [market price](../m/market_price.md) at which a particular [asset](../a/asset.md) can be bought or sold for immediate delivery.
- **[Futures](../f/futures.md) Price:** The agreed-upon price for the future delivery of an [asset](../a/asset.md), which is determined in the [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md).

### The Role of Contango in Commodity Markets

In [commodity](../c/commodity.md) markets, contango usually occurs due to the associated costs of storing and insuring the [commodity](../c/commodity.md) until the delivery date. For instance, if you are trading in oil, the cost of storage, [insurance](../i/insurance.md), and [financing](../f/financing.md) the [inventory](../i/inventory.md) [will](../w/will.md) be factored into the [futures](../f/futures.md) price. Therefore, the [futures](../f/futures.md) price [will](../w/will.md) be higher than the [spot price](../s/spot_price.md) to cover these costs.

### Contango and Arbitrage

In a contango situation, there is an opportunity for arbitrageurs. They can buy the [commodity](../c/commodity.md) at the current [spot price](../s/spot_price.md), store it, and simultaneously sell a [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) at the higher [futures](../f/futures.md) price. The [profit](../p/profit.md) from this [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) opportunity is the difference between the [futures](../f/futures.md) price and the [spot price](../s/spot_price.md), minus the costs of storage and other related expenses.

## Factors Contributing to Contango

Several factors contribute to the occurrence of contango in the [market](../m/market.md):

### Storage Costs

The cost of storing a [commodity](../c/commodity.md) until the delivery date can contribute significantly to the contango condition. Commodities like oil, natural gas, and metals often have significant storage costs, which are factored into the [futures](../f/futures.md) prices.

### Insurance and Maintenance

[Insurance](../i/insurance.md) costs and the maintenance of storage facilities are other expenses that can lead to contango. These costs can accumulate over time and are included in the calculation of the [futures](../f/futures.md) price.

### Interest Rates

[Interest](../i/interest.md) rates also play a crucial role in contango. Higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates increase the cost of carrying the [commodity](../c/commodity.md) since the [financing](../f/financing.md) costs are pushed higher. This, in turn, increases the [futures](../f/futures.md) price.

### Convenience Yield

The convenience [yield](../y/yield.md) is the benefit or [premium](../p/premium.md) associated with holding a physical [commodity](../c/commodity.md) over holding a [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md). When convenience yields are low, [futures](../f/futures.md) prices tend to be higher than spot prices, contributing to contango.

## Contango in Different Markets

While contango is often discussed in the context of [commodity](../c/commodity.md) markets, it can occur in various other markets, including:

### Financial Instruments

In [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), contango can apply to [interest rate futures](../i/interest_rate_futures.md), [bond futures](../b/bond_futures.md), and other [derivative](../d/derivative.md) instruments. Here, contango is influenced by factors such as future expectations of [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, [inflation](../i/inflation.md), and economic outlooks.

### Stock Indices

Stock [index futures](../i/index_futures.md) can also exhibit contango. For example, if investors expect the [stock market](../s/stock_market.md) to rise in the future, the [futures](../f/futures.md) price of a stock [index](../i/index.md) might be higher than the current [spot price](../s/spot_price.md).

### Foreign Exchange Markets

Even in the [foreign exchange](../f/foreign_exchange.md) markets, [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) can display contango. This usually happens due to differences in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates between two currencies.

## How Investors and Traders Use Contango

Understanding contango is crucial for various [market](../m/market.md) participants, including speculators, hedgers, and arbitrageurs. Hereâ€™s how different players utilize contango in their strategies:

### Speculators

Speculators may seek to [profit](../p/profit.md) from contango by taking long positions in [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) if they believe that prices [will](../w/will.md) rise significantly by the contract's expiry date.

### Hedgers

Hedgers use [futures](../f/futures.md) markets to manage [risk](../r/risk.md). For instance, a [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md) producer might sell oil [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) to lock in a selling price for future production amidst a contango situation.

### Arbitrageurs

Arbitrageurs aim to exploit price discrepancies in the [market](../m/market.md). They [will](../w/will.md) undertake a [risk](../r/risk.md)-free [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) if they find price [gaps](../g/gap.md) in the contango [market](../m/market.md) that cover all associated costs, including storage and [insurance](../i/insurance.md).

## Examples of Contango

### Oil Market

One of the most well-known examples of contango can be found in the oil [market](../m/market.md). When there is an [oversupply](../o/oversupply.md) of oil, storage levels increase, and so do the storage costs. This can lead to higher [futures](../f/futures.md) prices as traders anticipate the costs of storing the excess oil.

### Gold Market

Industrial metals like gold can also display contango. If investors expect higher [demand](../d/demand.md) in the future or higher storage costs, the [futures](../f/futures.md) prices for gold can exceed the spot prices.

## Risks Associated with Contango

While contango can [offer](../o/offer.md) [profit](../p/profit.md) opportunities, it also involves risks, particularly for investors holding long positions in [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md).

### Negative Roll Yield

One of the significant risks in a contango [market](../m/market.md) is the negative [roll yield](../r/roll_yield.md). This occurs when an [investor](../i/investor.md) must continually roll over expiring [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) into new ones at higher prices. The difference between the expiring contract's price and the new contract's price can erode potential profits.

### Mispricing Risks

In a contango [market](../m/market.md), the [futures](../f/futures.md) price may not always accurately reflect the true future [spot price](../s/spot_price.md) due to the various costs factored in. This can lead to mispricing risks and potential losses.

### Liquidity Risks

Not all [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) are [liquid](../l/liquid.md), particularly those for less-traded commodities. In such cases, the costs associated with entering and exiting positions can be high, increasing the risks for investors.

## Contango vs. Backwardation

Contango is often contrasted with [backwardation](../b/backwardation.md). While contango features [futures](../f/futures.md) prices higher than the spot prices, [backwardation](../b/backwardation.md) is the opposite:

- **[Backwardation](../b/backwardation.md):** The [futures](../f/futures.md) prices are lower than the current spot prices. This scenario often occurs when there are short-term [supply](../s/supply.md) shortages or strong immediate [demand](../d/demand.md) for a [commodity](../c/commodity.md). 

Both contango and [backwardation](../b/backwardation.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) different implications for [market](../m/market.md) participants and their strategies.

## Conclusion

Contango is a vital concept in the world of trading and investment, particularly in the context of [commodity](../c/commodity.md) markets. By understanding the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) factors contributing to contango, such as storage costs, [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, and convenience [yield](../y/yield.md), investors and traders can better navigate the complexities of [futures](../f/futures.md) markets. Despite the potential for profits, it is essential to be aware of the associated risks, including the negative [roll yield](../r/roll_yield.md) and mispricing risks. Whether you are a [speculator](../s/speculator.md), hedger, or [arbitrageur](../a/arbitrageur.md), understanding contango and its counterpart [backwardation](../b/backwardation.md) can help in making informed trading decisions.

### Margin Trading
For experienced traders, Coinone offers [margin trading](../m/margin_trading.md) services.

[Margin trading](../m/margin_trading.md) comes with additional risks and is recommended for traders who understand the intricacies of leveraged trading.

### Staking
Coinone provides staking services for several cryptocurrencies, allowing users to earn rewards by participating in the network. Staking involves holding a particular cryptocurrency in a wallet to support its operations such as [transaction](../t/transaction.md) validation and network [security](../s/security.md).

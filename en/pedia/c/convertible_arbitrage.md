# Convertible Arbitrage

Convertible [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) is a type of market-neutral investment strategy often employed by hedge funds. It involves taking long positions in convertible securities—such as convertible bonds or preferred shares—while simultaneously taking short positions in the underlying common stock. This strategy aims to exploit the pricing inefficiencies between the convertible security and the underlying stock to generate risk-adjusted returns.

## Components of Convertible Securities

### Convertible Bonds

A convertible bond is a fixed-income security that can be converted into a predetermined number of the issuer's equity shares. Convertible bonds typically offer lower interest rates but provide investors with the option to convert them into stock, allowing participation in the potential upside of the issuer's stock performance.

### Preferred Shares

Convertible preferred shares work similarly to convertible bonds, providing holders with the option to convert into a predetermined number of common shares. These also pay dividends, often with higher priority over common stock but lower than bonds in case of bankruptcy.

## Mechanics of Convertible Arbitrage

### Long Position in Convertible Security

The first step involves purchasing a long position in the convertible security. This security contains both debt and equity characteristics, providing a steady stream of income through interest or dividends while offering the potential for equity appreciation.

### Short Position in Common Stock

To hedge the equity exposure inherent in the convertible security, the trader takes a short position in the underlying common stock. The number of shorted shares typically equals the likely conversion ratio of the convertible bond or preferred share.

### Delta Hedging

An integral part of this strategy is [delta hedging](../d/delta_hedging.md), where 'delta' refers to the ratio of the change in the price of the convertible security to the change in the price of the underlying stock. As the stock price fluctuates, the trader must continually adjust the short position to maintain a market-neutral posture.

## Profit Scenarios and Risk Management

### Profitable Scenarios

Profitability in convertible [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) arises when the fair value of the convertible security deviates from its market price. Successful [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) opportunities often result in capturing interest income, dividend income, and the profit from the underlying stock's volatility.

### Risk Management

1. **Credit Risk** - If the issuer of the convertible security defaults, the value of the security could plummet.
2. **[Liquidity Risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md)** - Convertible securities and the associated equities may not always have high liquidity, which can complicate the execution of trades.
3. **Market Risk** - Significant market movements can affect the strategy's profitability despite the market-neutral intent.

## Calculation Example

To illustrate, consider a convertible bond issued by Company X:
- **Convertible Bond Price**: $1000
- **Conversion Ratio**: 20 common shares for each bond
- **Interest Rate on Bond**: 5%
- **Current Stock Price**: $45 per share

### Steps:
1. **Long Position in Convertible Bond**: Purchase the bond for $1000.
2. **Short Position in Common Stock**: Short 20 shares of the common stock.

### Delta Hedging:
Assume the delta is 0.75. Initially, you should short:
\[ 20 \times 0.75 = 15 \text{ shares} \]

As the stock price changes, you must adjust the short position by re-evaluating the delta and re-balancing your portfolio accordingly.

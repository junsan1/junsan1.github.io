# Convertible Arbitrage

Convertible [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) is a type of [market](../m/market.md)-[neutral](../n/neutral.md) [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) often employed by [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds. It involves taking long positions in convertible securities—such as convertible bonds or preferred [shares](../s/shares.md)—while simultaneously taking short positions in the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [common stock](../c/common_stock.md). This strategy aims to exploit the pricing inefficiencies between the convertible [security](../s/security.md) and the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock to generate [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted returns.

## Components of Convertible Securities

### Convertible Bonds

A [convertible bond](../c/convertible_bond.md) is a [fixed-income security](../f/fixed-income_security.md) that can be converted into a predetermined number of the [issuer](../i/issuer.md)'s [equity](../e/equity.md) [shares](../s/shares.md). Convertible bonds typically [offer](../o/offer.md) lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates but provide investors with the option to convert them into stock, allowing participation in the potential [upside](../u/upside.md) of the [issuer](../i/issuer.md)'s stock performance.

### Preferred Shares

Convertible preferred [shares](../s/shares.md) work similarly to convertible bonds, providing holders with the option to convert into a predetermined number of common [shares](../s/shares.md). These also pay dividends, often with higher priority over [common stock](../c/common_stock.md) but lower than bonds in case of [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md).

## Mechanics of Convertible Arbitrage

### Long Position in Convertible Security

The first step involves purchasing a long position in the convertible [security](../s/security.md). This [security](../s/security.md) contains both [debt](../d/debt.md) and [equity](../e/equity.md) characteristics, providing a steady stream of [income](../i/income.md) through [interest](../i/interest.md) or dividends while [offering](../o/offering.md) the potential for [equity](../e/equity.md) appreciation.

### Short Position in Common Stock

To [hedge](../h/hedge.md) the [equity](../e/equity.md) exposure inherent in the convertible [security](../s/security.md), the [trader](../t/trader.md) takes a short position in the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [common stock](../c/common_stock.md). The number of shorted [shares](../s/shares.md) typically equals the likely conversion ratio of the [convertible bond](../c/convertible_bond.md) or preferred share.

### Delta Hedging

An integral part of this strategy is [delta hedging](../d/delta_hedging.md), where '[delta](../d/delta.md)' refers to the ratio of the change in the price of the convertible [security](../s/security.md) to the change in the price of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock. As the stock price fluctuates, the [trader](../t/trader.md) must continually adjust the short position to maintain a [market](../m/market.md)-[neutral](../n/neutral.md) posture.

## Profit Scenarios and Risk Management

### Profitable Scenarios

Profitability in convertible [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) arises when the [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) of the convertible [security](../s/security.md) deviates from its [market price](../m/market_price.md). Successful [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) opportunities often result in capturing [interest](../i/interest.md) [income](../i/income.md), [dividend](../d/dividend.md) [income](../i/income.md), and the [profit](../p/profit.md) from the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock's [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

### Risk Management

1. **[Credit Risk](../c/credit_risk.md)** - If the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) of the convertible [security](../s/security.md) defaults, the [value](../v/value.md) of the [security](../s/security.md) could plummet.
2. **[Liquidity Risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md)** - Convertible securities and the associated equities may not always have high [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), which can complicate the [execution](../e/execution.md) of trades.
3. **[Market Risk](../m/market_risk.md)** - Significant [market](../m/market.md) movements can affect the strategy's profitability despite the [market](../m/market.md)-[neutral](../n/neutral.md) intent.

## Calculation Example

To illustrate, consider a [convertible bond](../c/convertible_bond.md) issued by Company X:
- **[Convertible Bond](../c/convertible_bond.md) Price**: $1000
- **Conversion Ratio**: 20 common [shares](../s/shares.md) for each [bond](../b/bond.md)
- **[Interest Rate](../i/interest_rate.md) on [Bond](../b/bond.md)**: 5%
- **Current Stock Price**: $45 per share

### Steps:
1. **Long Position in [Convertible Bond](../c/convertible_bond.md)**: Purchase the [bond](../b/bond.md) for $1000.
2. **Short Position in [Common Stock](../c/common_stock.md)**: Short 20 [shares](../s/shares.md) of the [common stock](../c/common_stock.md).

### Delta Hedging:
Assume the [delta](../d/delta.md) is 0.75. Initially, you should short:
\[ 20 \times 0.75 = 15 \text{ [shares](../s/shares.md)} \]

As the stock price changes, you must adjust the short position by re-evaluating the [delta](../d/delta.md) and re-balancing your portfolio accordingly.

## Conclusion

Convertible [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) requires advanced analytical skills, significant [capital](../c/capital.md), and a deep understanding of [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md). Although [lucrative](../l/lucrative.md), the strategy involves [multiple](../m/multiple.md) types of risks, which necessitates comprehensive [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) protocols. Institutional investors and [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds are generally well-equipped to conduct such [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) given their access to sophisticated tools and technologies.

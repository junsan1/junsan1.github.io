# Corporate Tax

Corporate tax, also known as [corporation](../c/corporation.md) tax or company tax, is a tax imposed on the net [income](../i/income.md) or [profit](../p/profit.md) of corporations and similar legal entities. This tax varies greatly in rates and regulations across different countries and jurisdictions but essentially represents a percentage of the company's profits that must be paid to the government. Understanding corporate tax requires delving into the specifics of how it operates, what it affects, and the various implications for businesses and economies.

## Definition and Purpose

Corporate tax is a levy placed on the [profit](../p/profit.md) of a [firm](../f/firm.md) to raise [taxes](../t/taxes.md) for government revenues. The purpose of corporate [taxation](../t/taxation.md) is manifold â€“ it is a significant source of national [revenue](../r/revenue.md), it aims to ensure that corporations contribute to the [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) and services that support their operations, and it seeks to promote fairness by taxing profits made by companies within a jurisdiction.

## Calculation of Corporate Tax

The calculation of corporate tax begins with the determination of [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md), which is calculated as the [corporation](../c/corporation.md)'s [gross income](../g/gross_income.md) minus allowable deductions. Key components include:

- **[Gross Income](../g/gross_income.md)**: Total [revenue](../r/revenue.md) earned by a [corporation](../c/corporation.md) from its [business activities](../b/business_activities.md).
- **Deductions**: Expenses that are allowed to be subtracted from [gross income](../g/gross_income.md) to determine [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md). These may include cost of goods sold, wages, [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md), operating expenses, [interest](../i/interest.md), rents, and other [business](../b/business.md) expenditures.
- **Tax Payable**: The actual amount of tax that a [corporation](../c/corporation.md) owes, calculated by applying the relevant [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md) to the [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md).

The process can be complex as it involves various regulations and laws that differ across jurisdictions.

## Types of Corporate Entities Subject to Tax

Corporate tax applies to various forms of corporate entities including:
- **C Corporations**: Standard corporations that are taxed separately from their owners.
- **S Corporations**: Small businesses that meet certain Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Code requirements and opt to pass corporate [income](../i/income.md), losses, deductions, and credits through to their shareholders for federal tax purposes.
- **[Limited Liability](../l/limited_liability.md) Companies (LLCs)**: [Business](../b/business.md) structures allowed by state statute that [offer](../o/offer.md) advantages similar to partnerships or corporations depending on the elections made by the LLC and the number of members.
- **Non-[profit](../p/profit.md) Organizations**: While non-profits are generally exempt from corporate tax when [income](../i/income.md) is related to their exempt purposes, unrelated [business](../b/business.md) [income](../i/income.md) may still be subject to corporate tax.

## Corporate Tax Rates

Corporate tax rates vary globally, with some countries [offering](../o/offering.md) highly competitive rates to attract [foreign investment](../f/foreign_investment.md). For instance:

- **United States**: As of 2021, the federal corporate [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md) is 21%.
- **United Kingdom**: The [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) Tax main rate for 2021 is 19%, with planned increases.
- **Ireland**: Known for its low corporate [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md) of 12.5%, attracting many multinational corporations.
- **United Arab Emirates (UAE)**: Offers a [tax holiday](../t/tax_holiday.md) in certain free zones.

## Key Concepts

- **[Double Taxation](../d/double_taxation.md)**: Occurs when corporate [income](../i/income.md) is taxed at both the corporate level and personal level (when dividends are distributed to shareholders).
- **Tax Incentives**: Various governments provide tax credits, deductions, or holidays to encourage certain activities or investments.
- **[Transfer Pricing](../t/transfer_price.md)**: Regulations related to pricing transactions between corporate subsidiaries to prevent [profit](../p/profit.md) shifting and ensure each entity is appropriately taxed.

## Corporate Tax Avoidance and Evasion

Avoidance and evasion represent significant issues in corporate [taxation](../t/taxation.md):

- **[Tax Avoidance](../t/tax_avoidance.md)**: Legal strategies used by corporations to minimize their [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md). These may include taking advantage of loopholes, deductions, and credits.
- **[Tax Evasion](../t/tax_evasion.md)**: Illegal practices to evade [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md), such as underreporting [income](../i/income.md) or inflating deductions.

Governments worldwide are constantly improving legislative frameworks and international cooperation to combat [tax evasion](../t/tax_evasion.md) and avoidance.

## Impact on Businesses

Corporate tax directly affects the profitability and investment strategies of businesses:

- **[Cash Flow](../c/cash_flow.md)**: [Taxes](../t/taxes.md) reduce the amount of cash available for [reinvestment](../r/reinvestment.md), [expansion](../e/expansion.md), or dividends.
- **Investment Decisions**: Favorable tax regimes can attract businesses to certain regions, while high tax rates can deter investment.
- **Financial Reporting**: Corporations must accurately account for tax liabilities in their [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md), impacting reported [earnings](../e/earnings.md).

## Compliance and International Standards

Compliance with corporate tax laws requires meticulous record-keeping and adherence to regulations. International standards such as the OECD's Base Erosion and [Profit](../p/profit.md) Shifting (BEPS) initiatives aim to ensure that companies pay [taxes](../t/taxes.md) where economic activities generating profits are performed and where [value](../v/value.md) is created.

## Resources and Tools

- **Corporate Tax Software**: Many companies use sophisticated software systems to manage tax compliance, such as ADP, Avalara, and Vertex.
- **Tax Advisory Services**: Consultancy firms such as Deloitte, Ernst & Young, PwC, and KPMG provide expert advice on navigating complex tax environments.

## Future Trends

- **Digital [Economy](../e/economy.md) [Taxation](../t/taxation.md)**: Given the rise of the digital [economy](../e/economy.md), new frameworks such as digital services [taxes](../t/taxes.md) (DSTs) are being introduced.
- **Global Minimum Tax**: Initiatives like the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework propose a global minimum [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md) to curb [tax base](../t/tax_base.md) erosion.

## Conclusion

Corporate tax is a multifaceted aspect of [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md) and public policy. It involves a balance between generating government [revenue](../r/revenue.md) and fostering a competitive [business](../b/business.md) environment. Understanding corporate tax principles, compliance requirements, and evolving international standards is crucial for corporations operating in a globalized [economy](../e/economy.md).

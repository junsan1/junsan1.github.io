# Conventional Mortgage

A conventional [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) is a type of [home](../h/home.md) [loan](../l/loan.md) that is not insured or guaranteed by the federal government. It is typically issued by banks, [credit](../c/credit.md) unions, and [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) companies, and adheres to the guidelines set by government-sponsored entities like Fannie Mae or [Freddie Mac](../f/freddie_mac.md). Conventional mortgages can be contrasted with government-backed mortgages such as FHA, VA, and USDA loans.

## Components of a Conventional Mortgage

### Down Payment

A conventional [loan](../l/loan.md) usually requires a [down payment](../d/down_payment.md) of at least 3% to 5% of the [home](../h/home.md)'s purchase price. However, a 20% [down payment](../d/down_payment.md) is often recommended to avoid the need for private [mortgage insurance](../m/mortgage_insurance.md) (PMI). PMI is an additional monthly cost that protects the [lender](../l/lender.md) if the borrower defaults on the [loan](../l/loan.md). High down payments can also help secure better [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

### Loan Terms

Conventional loans come with various term lengths, most commonly 15 or 30 years. The borrower can choose a [fixed-rate mortgage](../f/fixed-rate_mortgage.md), where the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) remains constant throughout the term of the [loan](../l/loan.md), or an adjustable-rate [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) (ARM), with an [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) that can change periodically based on [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

### Interest Rates

[Interest](../i/interest.md) rates for conventional mortgages are influenced by various factors, including the borrower’s [credit score](../c/credit_score.md), the size of the [down payment](../d/down_payment.md), the [loan](../l/loan.md) amount, and overall [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md). Generally, borrowers with higher [credit](../c/credit.md) scores and larger down payments [will](../w/will.md) receive more favorable [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

### Credit Requirements

To qualify for a conventional [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md), borrowers typically need a [credit score](../c/credit_score.md) of at least 620, though higher scores [will](../w/will.md) increase the chances of approval and better terms. Lenders [will](../w/will.md) also scrutinize the borrower’s [debt](../d/debt.md)-to-[income](../i/income.md) ratio (DTI), which should ideally be under 36%, though some lenders may allow up to 50%.

### Loan Limits

The Federal Housing [Finance](../f/finance.md) Agency (FHFA) sets [loan](../l/loan.md) limits for conventional mortgages. These limits vary by region and are updated annually. As of 2023, the conforming [loan](../l/loan.md) limit for a single-family [home](../h/home.md) in most parts of the U.S. is $726,200. Loans that exceed these limits are considered jumbo loans and typically come with higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and stricter qualification requirements.

## Types of Conventional Mortgages

### Conforming Loans

Conforming loans adhere to the [loan](../l/loan.md) limits and guidelines set by Fannie Mae and [Freddie Mac](../f/freddie_mac.md). They are the most common type of conventional [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) and usually come with competitive [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and more flexible terms.

### Non-Conforming Loans

Non-conforming loans do not meet the guidelines set by Fannie Mae and [Freddie Mac](../f/freddie_mac.md). This category includes jumbo loans, which exceed the local conforming [loan](../l/loan.md) limits. Non-conforming loans often have higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and stricter qualification criteria.

## Advantages of Conventional Mortgages

1. **Flexibility in Terms:** Conventional [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) borrowers have a wide array of term lengths and structure [options](../o/options.md). This flexibility can accommodate various financial situations and preferences.
  
2. **No Private [Mortgage Insurance](../m/mortgage_insurance.md) (PMI) with 20% Down:** Unlike FHA loans, which always require [mortgage insurance](../m/mortgage_insurance.md) premiums for the life of the [loan](../l/loan.md), conventional loans do not require PMI if the [down payment](../d/down_payment.md) is 20% or more.

3. **Potential for Lower Costs:** With [good credit](../g/good_credit.md) and a substantial [down payment](../d/down_payment.md), borrowers might secure lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and monthly payments compared to government-backed loans.

4. **Higher [Loan](../l/loan.md) Limits:** Especially with jumbo loans, conventional mortgages can accommodate higher-priced homes, making them suitable for affluent buyers.

## Disadvantages of Conventional Mortgages

1. **Higher [Credit Score](../c/credit_score.md) Requirements:** Conventional loans typically have stricter [credit score](../c/credit_score.md) requirements than government-backed loans, making it harder for borrowers with low or average [credit](../c/credit.md) scores to qualify.

2. **Larger Down Payments:** While it’s possible to get a conventional [loan](../l/loan.md) with a smaller [down payment](../d/down_payment.md), a 20% [down payment](../d/down_payment.md) is often recommended to avoid PMI, which might be challenging for some borrowers to afford.

3. **Stricter [Income](../i/income.md) Requirements:** Lenders may require more documentation and have stricter DTI ratios, making approval potentially more difficult for some borrowers.

## Process of Getting a Conventional Mortgage

### Pre-Approval

The first step in obtaining a conventional [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) is getting pre-approved by a [lender](../l/lender.md). This involves providing financial documents such as tax returns, [bank](../b/bank.md) statements, and proof of [income](../i/income.md). The [lender](../l/lender.md) [will](../w/will.md) perform a [credit](../c/credit.md) [check](../c/check.md) and provide a pre-approval letter indicating how much the borrower can likely afford.

### Choosing a Lender

Borrowers should compare rates and terms offered by different lenders, including banks, [credit](../c/credit.md) unions, and [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) companies. Online comparison tools can be helpful.

### Application

After selecting a [lender](../l/lender.md), the formal application process begins. Borrowers [will](../w/will.md) need to submit detailed financial information and may need to provide additional documents as requested by the [lender](../l/lender.md).

### Underwriting

During [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md), the [lender](../l/lender.md) assesses the borrower’s financial history, [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md), and ability to repay the [loan](../l/loan.md). An [appraisal](../a/appraisal.md) of the property is typically required to ensure its [value](../v/value.md) meets the [loan](../l/loan.md) amount.

### Closing

Once [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) is complete, the [lender](../l/lender.md) [will](../w/will.md) [issue](../i/issue.md) a closing [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) outlining the [loan](../l/loan.md) terms, closing costs, and monthly [payment](../p/payment.md). The borrower [will](../w/will.md) review the document, arrange for [homeowners insurance](../h/homeowners_insurance.md), and potentially conduct a final walkthrough of the property. At closing, all necessary documents are signed, and the [loan](../l/loan.md) is funded, allowing the borrower to take ownership of the [home](../h/home.md).

## Refinance Options

Borrowers with conventional mortgages have the option to [refinance](../r/refinance.md) their loans. There are two primary types of refinancing:

### Rate-and-Term Refinance

This type of refinancing replaces the existing [loan](../l/loan.md) with a new one that has a different [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) or [loan](../l/loan.md) term. Borrowers might opt for this to secure a lower [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md), reduce monthly payments, or switch from an ARM to a [fixed-rate mortgage](../f/fixed-rate_mortgage.md).

### Cash-Out Refinance

A [cash-out refinance](../c/cash-out_refinance.md) allows the borrower to take out a new [loan](../l/loan.md) for more than the current [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) balance, receiving the difference in cash. This can be useful for funding [home](../h/home.md) improvements, paying off high-[interest](../i/interest.md) [debt](../d/debt.md), or covering other financial needs.

## Conclusion

Conventional mortgages [offer](../o/offer.md) flexibility and potentially lower costs for financially stable borrowers who meet the [credit](../c/credit.md), [income](../i/income.md), and [down payment](../d/down_payment.md) requirements. Understanding the different types of conventional loans, their benefits and drawbacks, and the process involved can help borrowers make informed decisions and secure the most favorable terms for their [home](../h/home.md) purchase or [refinance](../r/refinance.md).

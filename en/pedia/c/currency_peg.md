# Currency Peg

A [currency](../c/currency.md) peg, also known as a [fixed exchange rate](../f/fixed_exchange_rate.md), is a method by which a country maintains its [currency](../c/currency.md)'s [value](../v/value.md) at a [fixed exchange rate](../f/fixed_exchange_rate.md) to another [currency](../c/currency.md), a basket of currencies, or another measure of [value](../v/value.md) such as gold. This system contrasts with a [floating exchange rate](../f/floating_exchange_rate.md), where the [value](../v/value.md) of a [currency](../c/currency.md) is determined by [market](../m/market.md) forces without direct government or central [bank](../b/bank.md) intervention.

## Historical Context

The concept of [currency](../c/currency.md) [pegging](../p/pegging.md) can be traced back to the [gold standard](../g/gold_standard.md) era, where currencies were pegged to gold. Countries agreed to convert [currency](../c/currency.md) into a specified amount of gold, thereby establishing a fixed gold [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md). This system was later replaced by the Bretton Woods system, where currencies were pegged to the US dollar, which in turn was pegged to gold. The collapse of the Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s led to the adoption of floating [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates by many countries, although some still maintain various forms of [currency](../c/currency.md) pegs.

## Types of Currency Pegs

### Hard Peg

A hard peg is where the country's [currency](../c/currency.md) is absolutely fixed to another [currency](../c/currency.md) or basket of currencies. Countries with hard pegs completely abandon their own [currency](../c/currency.md), replacing it with another or establishing a [currency](../c/currency.md) board that rigidly controls the [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md). The primary example of a hard peg is the arrangement in some countries where the local [currency](../c/currency.md) is replaced by the US dollar, a practice known as "[dollarization](../d/dollarization.md)."

### Soft Peg or Adjustable Peg

A soft peg allows for a little more flexibility compared to a hard peg. Under this system, the [currency](../c/currency.md) is fixed to another [currency](../c/currency.md) or a basket of currencies but allowed to fluctuate within a small [range](../r/range.md). Adjustable pegs usually have mechanisms for periodic adjustments, which can be implemented in response to significant [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md) or shocks.

## Mechanisms and Instruments

Different tools and mechanisms are used to maintain a [currency](../c/currency.md) peg:

### Currency Reserves

Central banks maintain substantial reserves of the foreign [currency](../c/currency.md) to which the local [currency](../c/currency.md) is pegged. These reserves are used to buy or sell the local [currency](../c/currency.md) in the [foreign exchange](../f/foreign_exchange.md) [market](../m/market.md) to maintain the [fixed exchange rate](../f/fixed_exchange_rate.md).

### Interest Rate Adjustments

[Interest](../i/interest.md) rates can be adjusted to encourage or discourage [capital](../c/capital.md) flow, thereby influencing the [supply](../s/supply.md) and [demand](../d/demand.md) balance for the pegged [currency](../c/currency.md). For instance, high-[interest](../i/interest.md) rates may attract foreign investments, leading to an increased [demand](../d/demand.md) for the local [currency](../c/currency.md).

### Capital Controls

Some countries may impose [capital](../c/capital.md) controls to restrict the flow of [capital](../c/capital.md) in and out of the country. These controls can make it easier to maintain the peg by regulating the amount of foreign [currency](../c/currency.md) leaving or entering the [economy](../e/economy.md).

## Advantages of a Currency Peg

### Price Stability

A [fixed exchange rate](../f/fixed_exchange_rate.md) can provide greater price stability by reducing the uncertainties associated with [currency](../c/currency.md) fluctuations. This stability can help in reducing [inflation](../i/inflation.md) and promote [long-term investments](../l/long-term_investments.md).

### Trade and Economic Integration

A [currency](../c/currency.md) peg can facilitate international [trade](../t/trade.md) and investment by providing predictability in [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates. This predictability makes cross-border transactions less risky and more attractive to investors.

### Credibility

For countries with a history of high [inflation](../i/inflation.md) or economic instability, a [currency](../c/currency.md) peg can help build credibility. By committing to a [fixed exchange rate](../f/fixed_exchange_rate.md), governments can signal their dedication to economic stability and fiscal discipline.

## Disadvantages of a Currency Peg

### Limited Monetary Policy

Maintaining a [currency](../c/currency.md) peg severely limits a country's ability to conduct independent [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md). Central banks may find it difficult to adjust [interest](../i/interest.md) rates or conduct [open market operations](../o/open_market_operations.md) tailored to domestic [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md).

### Vulnerability to Speculative Attacks

[Currency](../c/currency.md) pegs can make a country vulnerable to speculative attacks. If investors believe that a [currency](../c/currency.md) is [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md) or that the central [bank](../b/bank.md) cannot maintain the peg, they may start selling off the [currency](../c/currency.md), leading to a [depletion](../d/depletion.md) of foreign reserves and potential [devaluation](../d/devaluation.md).

### Importing Economic Conditions

If the pegged [currency](../c/currency.md) experiences economic issues such as [inflation](../i/inflation.md) or [recession](../r/recession.md), these conditions can be imported into the country with the peg. This can lead to economic disturbances that may not have occurred under a [floating exchange rate](../f/floating_exchange_rate.md) system.

## Examples of Currency Pegs

### Hong Kong Dollar (HKD) Pegged to USD

The Hong Kong Dollar (HKD) has been pegged to the US Dollar (USD) since 1983. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority maintains this peg by keeping the HKD/USD [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) in the [range](../r/range.md) of 7.75 to 7.85. More information can be found on the [Hong Kong Monetary Authority's website](https://www.hkma.gov.hk).

### Chinese Yuan (CNY) Managed Float

Although the Chinese Yuan (CNY) was historically pegged to the USD, it has moved to a managed [float](../f/float.md) system where the [currency](../c/currency.md) is allowed to [trade](../t/trade.md) within a certain [range](../r/range.md) against a basket of currencies. The People's [Bank](../b/bank.md) of China regularly intervenes to ensure that the [currency](../c/currency.md) remains stable. For more information, visit the [People's Bank of China's website](http://www.pbc.gov.cn).

### Saudi Riyal (SAR) Pegged to USD

The Saudi Riyal (SAR) has been pegged to the US Dollar since 1986. The [fixed exchange rate](../f/fixed_exchange_rate.md) is maintained at 3.75 SAR per USD. Saudi Arabia uses its considerable foreign reserves to manage this peg. For more information, visit the [Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority's website](https://www.sama.gov.sa).

## Real-World Challenges and Considerations

### Economic Shocks

Countries with [currency](../c/currency.md) pegs can be severely affected by economic shocks. For instance, a sudden rise in the [value](../v/value.md) of the pegged [currency](../c/currency.md) can make exports more expensive, adversely affecting [trade](../t/trade.md) balances.

### Structural Adjustments

To maintain a [currency](../c/currency.md) peg, countries may need to implement structural adjustments that can be economically and politically challenging. These adjustments can include austerity measures, [labor market](../l/labor_market.md) reforms, and changes in fiscal policies.

### International Assistance

Sometimes, maintaining a [currency](../c/currency.md) peg can require international assistance or support from institutions like the International Monetary [Fund](../f/fund.md) (IMF). This assistance often comes with conditions and oversight, which might limit the country's economic sovereignty.

## Conclusion

[Currency](../c/currency.md) pegs [offer](../o/offer.md) a mix of benefits and drawbacks, and their success largely depends on the specific economic context and the ability of government and central [bank](../b/bank.md) authorities to maintain the peg. While they can provide much-needed stability and credibility, they also impose significant constraints on [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) and expose countries to various economic risks.

# Canceled Check

A canceled [check](../c/check.md) is a [check](../c/check.md) that has been paid or cleared by the [bank](../b/bank.md) it was drawn on after it has been deposited or cashed. When a [check](../c/check.md) is canceled, it is marked in such a way that it cannot be reused. This marking could include physically stamping "canceled" on the [check](../c/check.md), creating perforations that spell out "canceled," or electronically marking it as such in banking systems.

## The Lifecycle of a Check

1. **Issuance**: The account holder writes a [check](../c/check.md) to a recipient.
2. **[Endorsement](../e/endorsement.md)**: The recipient endorses the [check](../c/check.md) by signing it on the back.
3. **[Deposit](../d/deposit.md)/Cashing**: The endorsed [check](../c/check.md) is either deposited into a [bank](../b/bank.md) account or cashed at a [bank](../b/bank.md).
4. **Processing**: The recipient’s [bank](../b/bank.md) sends the [check](../c/check.md) to the issuing [bank](../b/bank.md) for [payment](../p/payment.md). Both banks communicate through systems like the Automated [Clearing House](../c/clearing_house.md) (ACH).
5. **[Clearing](../c/clearing.md)**: The issuing [bank](../b/bank.md) determines if the [check](../c/check.md)-[writer](../w/writer.md)’s account has enough funds to cover the [check](../c/check.md). If funds are available, they are transferred from the [issuer](../i/issuer.md)’s account to the recipient’s account.
6. **Cancelation**: Once the transfer is complete, the [check](../c/check.md) is marked as canceled.

## Importance of a Canceled Check

- **Proof of [Payment](../p/payment.md)**: A canceled [check](../c/check.md) serves as proof that a [payment](../p/payment.md) was made. The [bank](../b/bank.md) retains an electronic copy of the canceled [check](../c/check.md), and account holders can often download these from their [online banking](../o/online_banking.md) portal.
- **Dispute Resolution**: In cases where there is a disagreement about whether a [payment](../p/payment.md) was made, a canceled [check](../c/check.md) can be presented as evidence.
- **Recordkeeping**: For tax purposes and personal financial management, canceled checks provide a clear record of expenditures.

## Electronic Check Processing

In modern banking, many checks are processed electronically through the [Check](../c/check.md) 21 Act, also known as the [Check](../c/check.md) [Clearing](../c/clearing.md) for the 21st Century Act. This allows banks to [handle](../h/handle.md) checks “truncated,” meaning they convert the paper [check](../c/check.md) into an electronic image and process it without the physical document. Electronic processing speeds up the time it takes for checks to clear and reduces the [risk](../r/risk.md) of errors related to paper handling.

## Risks and Considerations

- **[Security](../s/security.md)**: Even though checks are intended for single use, a canceled [check](../c/check.md) still contains sensitive information such as the [account number](../a/account_number.md) and routing number. Proper disposal methods should be employed to prevent misuse.
- **[Fraud](../f/fraud.md)**: If a [check](../c/check.md) is not properly canceled, there is a [risk](../r/risk.md) that someone could attempt to alter and reuse it.

## Legal Standing

The rules surrounding the issuance, processing, and cancelation of checks are governed by both federal and state laws. For instance, the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) provides a comprehensive set of laws for commercial transactions, including [check](../c/check.md) processing.

# Correction

## Definition
A **Correction** refers to a short-term decline in the price of a stock, [bond](../b/bond.md), [commodity](../c/commodity.md), or [index](../i/index_instrument.md), usually following a sustained increase. Corrections are generally seen as a normal part of [market cycles](../m/market_cycles.md) and occur when prices fall by 10% or more from their recent peak.

## Key Components
1. **Short-Term Decline**: Corrections typically involve a temporary drop in prices rather than a prolonged downturn.
2. **Price Decrease**: A correction is usually defined as a decline of 10% or more from a recent high.
3. **[Market Cycles](../m/market_cycles.md)**: Corrections are considered a natural part of [market](../m/market.md) fluctuations and cycles.

## Causes of Corrections
1. **Overvaluation**: When assets are perceived to be overpriced, a correction can occur as prices adjust to more reasonable levels.
2. **Economic Data**: Negative [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md), such as lower-than-expected GDP growth or rising [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md), can trigger corrections.
3. **Geopolitical Events**: Political instability, conflicts, or unexpected geopolitical developments can lead to [market](../m/market.md) corrections.
4. **[Market Sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md)**: Changes in [investor](../i/investor.md) sentiment, such as fear or panic selling, can cause a temporary drop in prices.
5. **[Profit](../p/profit.md)-Taking**: Investors may sell off assets to [lock in profits](../l/lock_in_profits.md) after a significant run-up in prices, leading to a correction.

## Importance
1. **[Market](../m/market.md) Health**: Corrections help maintain the overall health of the [market](../m/market.md) by preventing [bubbles](../b/bubble.md) and encouraging price stability.
2. **Buying Opportunities**: Corrections can provide investors with opportunities to purchase assets at lower prices.
3. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Understanding corrections helps investors manage [risk](../r/risk.md) and set appropriate investment strategies.

## Example Scenario
### Stock Market Correction
- **Recent Peak**: A major stock [index](../i/index_instrument.md), such as the S&P 500, reaches a new high of 4,500 points.
- **Correction Trigger**: Negative economic news, such as lower-than-expected corporate [earnings](../e/earnings.md) reports, causes [investor](../i/investor.md) concern.
- **Price Decline**: Over a few weeks, the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) falls by 10% to 4,050 points.
- **Recovery**: After the correction, [market](../m/market.md) conditions stabilize, and the [index](../i/index_instrument.md) begins to recover, moving back toward previous highs.

## Differences Between Corrections and Bear Markets
1. **[Duration](../d/duration.md)**: Corrections are typically short-term, lasting a few weeks to a few months. Bear markets are prolonged periods of declining prices, lasting months to years.
2. **Magnitude**: Corrections involve price declines of 10% or more, while bear markets involve declines of 20% or more from recent highs.
3. **[Market](../m/market.md) Conditions**: Corrections can occur in otherwise healthy markets, whereas bear markets are usually associated with economic downturns or recessions.

## How to Respond to Corrections
1. **Stay Calm**: Recognize that corrections are a normal part of [market cycles](../m/market_cycles.md) and avoid panic selling.
2. **Review Portfolio**: Assess your investment portfolio and make adjustments if necessary to ensure it aligns with your long-term goals and [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md).
3. **Look for Opportunities**: Consider buying quality assets at lower prices during a correction.
4. **Maintain [Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: Ensure your portfolio is diversified to reduce the impact of corrections on your overall investments.

## Conclusion
A correction is a temporary decline in [asset](../a/asset.md) prices, typically defined as a drop of 10% or more from a recent peak. Corrections are a normal part of [market cycles](../m/market_cycles.md) and can be caused by various factors, including overvaluation, economic data, and [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md). Understanding corrections helps investors manage [risk](../r/risk.md), identify buying opportunities, and maintain a long-term perspective on their investments.

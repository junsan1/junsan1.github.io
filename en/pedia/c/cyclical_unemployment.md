# Cyclical Unemployment

Cyclical [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) refers to the fluctuating levels of [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) that correspond with the [economic cycle](../e/economic_cycle.md) of boom and bust. It is the component of overall [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) that results directly from cycles of economic upturns and downturns. Cyclical [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) is distinct from other forms such as frictional and [structural unemployment](../s/structural_unemployment.md). This type of [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) increases during economic recessions and decreases when the [economy](../e/economy.md) begins to recover and grow again.

## Business Cycles and Unemployment

[Business](../b/business.md) cycles play a crucial role in cyclical [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md). An [economy](../e/economy.md) goes through various phases including [expansion](../e/expansion.md), peak, contraction (or [recession](../r/recession.md)), and [trough](../t/trough.md). During periods of economic [expansion](../e/expansion.md), businesses grow and hire more employees, thereby reducing the [unemployment rate](../u/unemployment_rate.md). Conversely, during periods of economic contraction, businesses reduce their workforce, leading to higher levels of [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md). 

### Expansion Phase
In this phase, economic activity increases across various sectors. Factors such as rising consumer confidence, an increase in investments, and favorable [government policies](../g/government_policies_in_trading.md) contribute to [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md). Firms often experience rising profits and therefore have the means and the need to expand their workforce. As a result, [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) rates typically decline during economic expansions.

### Peak Phase
The peak is the stage where the [economy](../e/economy.md) is at its highest point of growth. Businesses are operating at full capacity, [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) is at its lowest point, and [inflation](../i/inflation.md) might become a concern due to excessive [demand](../d/demand.md).

### Contraction Phase
During the contraction phase, economic activities slow down. Consumer [demand](../d/demand.md) falls, leading to reduced revenues for companies. In an attempt to cut costs, businesses might resort to layoffs and hiring freezes, thereby increasing the [unemployment rate](../u/unemployment_rate.md). This phase is characterized by declining industrial production, decreased consumer spending, and lower levels of [business](../b/business.md) investment.

### Trough Phase
The [trough](../t/trough.md) is the lowest point of an [economic cycle](../e/economic_cycle.md), where economic activity is at its weakest. [Unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) might be at its highest during this phase. However, it is also the stage that foreshadows recovery. Indicators such as lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and increased government spending can help to revive economic activity.

## Causes of Cyclical Unemployment

Cyclical [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) is primarily caused by factors that affect the broader [economy](../e/economy.md). These can include:

### Decline in Consumer Demand
A significant drop in consumer spending can lead to decreased revenues for companies. Lower [revenue](../r/revenue.md) often translates to reduced profits, which may result in cost-cutting measures like layoffs.

### Reduction in Business Investment
During an economic downturn, businesses might [hold](../h/hold.md) off on investments in new projects, machinery, or technology. The lack of investment leads to lesser [demand for labor](../d/demand_for_labor.md), thereby increasing [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md).

### External Shocks
Events such as natural disasters, geopolitical tensions, or pandemics can disrupt economic activities and lead to higher cyclical [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md). For instance, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant increase in cyclical [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) as businesses shut down and economic activities ground to a halt.

### Government Policies
While some [government policies](../g/government_policies_in_trading.md) aim to stabilize the [economy](../e/economy.md), others can inadvertently contribute to cyclical [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md). For example, high [taxation](../t/taxation.md) or stringent regulations can deter [business](../b/business.md) investments, leading to higher [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md).

## Measuring Cyclical Unemployment

Cyclical [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) is often measured using the [unemployment rate](../u/unemployment_rate.md) and GDP growth rate. These indicators can provide insights into the health of the [economy](../e/economy.md) and the extent of cyclical [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md).

### Unemployment Rate
The [unemployment rate](../u/unemployment_rate.md) is the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed and actively seeking employment. During recessions, the [unemployment rate](../u/unemployment_rate.md) tends to rise, indicating higher levels of cyclical [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md).

### GDP Growth Rate
The GDP growth rate measures the change in the economic output of a country. During periods of negative GDP growth, the [economy](../e/economy.md) is contracting, which typically leads to higher cyclical [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md).

## Impacts of Cyclical Unemployment

Cyclical [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) can have several adverse impacts on the [economy](../e/economy.md) and individuals:

### Economic Impacts
- **Lower Consumer Spending**: High [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) leads to lower [income](../i/income.md) for households, which in turn reduces consumer spending. This can create a vicious cycle, further hampering [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md).
- **Decreased Tax Revenues**: With fewer people employed, the government collects less in [taxes](../t/taxes.md), which can lead to [budget](../b/budget.md) deficits and reduced public spending.
- **Weaker [Business](../b/business.md) Performance**: High [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) can lead to decreased [demand](../d/demand.md) for goods and services, adversely affecting [business](../b/business.md) performance and profitability.

### Social Impacts
- **Increased [Poverty](../p/poverty.md)**: Long-term [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) can lead to increased [poverty](../p/poverty.md) levels as individuals exhaust their savings and struggle to meet their financial [obligations](../o/obligation.md).
- **Mental Health Issues**: The stress of being unemployed can lead to mental health issues such as [depression](../d/depression.md) and anxiety.
- **Skill Erosion**: Extended periods of [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) can result in the erosion of skills, making it harder for individuals to find new employment when the [economy](../e/economy.md) recovers.

## Policies to Mitigate Cyclical Unemployment

Governments and central banks can employ various policies to mitigate cyclical [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md):

### Fiscal Policies
- **Government Spending**: Increasing public spending can help stimulate economic activity and create jobs. [Infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) projects, for instance, can provide immediate employment opportunities.
- **Tax Cuts**: Reducing [taxes](../t/taxes.md) can increase [disposable income](../d/disposable_income.md) for consumers and provide businesses with more [capital](../c/capital.md) to invest, thereby stimulating economic activity and reducing [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md).

### Monetary Policies
- **Lowering [Interest](../i/interest.md) Rates**: Central banks can lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates to encourage borrowing and investment. Lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates reduce the cost of borrowing, making it cheaper for businesses to [finance](../f/finance.md) new projects and for consumers to take out loans.
- **[Quantitative Easing](../q/quantitative_easing.md)**: In times of severe economic downturns, central banks may resort to [quantitative easing](../q/quantitative_easing.md), which involves purchasing financial assets to inject [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) into the [economy](../e/economy.md).

### Labor Market Policies
- **Job Training Programs**: Providing job training and skill development programs can help individuals acquire new skills, making them more employable once the [economy](../e/economy.md) starts to recover.
- **[Unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) Benefits**: Providing [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) benefits can help alleviate the financial burden on unemployed individuals, enabling them to maintain some level of consumption, which supports overall economic activity.

## Case Studies of Cyclical Unemployment

### The Great Depression
One of the most significant examples of cyclical [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) occurred during the [Great Depression](../g/great_depression.md) of the 1930s. [Unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) rates soared as economic activity plummeted, leading to widespread [poverty](../p/poverty.md) and social upheaval. The [unemployment rate](../u/unemployment_rate.md) in the U.S. reached as high as 25% during the peak of the [depression](../d/depression.md).

### The 2008 Financial Crisis
The global [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) of 2008 is another example. The collapse of financial institutions and the subsequent economic downturn led to massive layoffs and a sharp increase in [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) rates worldwide. In the United States, the [unemployment rate](../u/unemployment_rate.md) rose from around 5% to 10% between 2008 and 2009.

### COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic led to an unprecedented increase in cyclical [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) as governments imposed lockdowns and businesses were forced to close. [Unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) rates spiked globally, and economies experienced severe recessions.

## Future Outlook

While cyclical [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) is an inevitable feature of [market](../m/market.md) economies, its impacts can be mitigated through appropriate policies. The increasing [globalization](../g/globalization.md) of markets means that [economic cycles](../e/economic_cycles.md) in one part of the world can quickly affect other regions. As such, international cooperation and coordinated policy responses are crucial in managing cyclical [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) effectively.

Technological advancements and the rise of automation also pose new challenges and opportunities. On the one hand, automation can lead to job losses in certain sectors; on the other hand, it can create new opportunities in technology-driven industries. Policymakers must therefore ensure that the workforce is equipped with the necessary skills to adapt to these changes.

In conclusion, while cyclical [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) is a significant challenge, it is a manageable one. By understanding its causes and implementing effective policies, governments and central banks can help smooth out the [economic cycle](../e/economic_cycle.md) and reduce the severity of [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) during economic downturns.

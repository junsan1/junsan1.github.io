# Roll Yield

Roll [yield](../y/yield.md) is a concept predominantly associated with the commodities [futures market](../f/futures_market.md) and refers to the profits or losses generated when a [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) is rolled over to a new contract with a later [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md). This phenomenon arises due to the shape of the [futures](../f/futures.md) curve, either in [contango](../c/contango.md) or [backwardation](../b/backwardation.md). Understanding roll [yield](../y/yield.md) is crucial for traders and investors involved in the [futures market](../f/futures_market.md) as it can significantly impact the overall returns on a [futures](../f/futures.md) investment. This topic is of particular importance for those engaged in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) and financial technology (fintech) where intricate understanding and precise calculations are paramount.

## Understanding Roll Yield

### Futures Contracts
To grasp the concept of roll [yield](../y/yield.md), it's essential first to understand [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md). A [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) is a standardized agreement to buy or sell an [asset](../a/asset.md) at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future. These contracts are commonly used for hedging or [speculation](../s/speculation.md) purposes.

### Contango and Backwardation
Roll [yield](../y/yield.md) is intrinsically linked to the [futures](../f/futures.md) curve, which can be in one of two states:

1. **[Contango](../c/contango.md)**: When the [futures](../f/futures.md) prices are higher than the spot prices. This usually occurs when the cost of carry (storage costs, [insurance](../i/insurance.md), etc.) outweighs the convenience [yield](../y/yield.md) (benefit of holding the physical [commodity](../c/commodity.md)). In [contango](../c/contango.md), the [futures](../f/futures.md) prices decline over time as they converge with the spot prices upon contract expiration.

2. **[Backwardation](../b/backwardation.md)**: When the [futures](../f/futures.md) prices are lower than the spot prices. This usually occurs when there is a high convenience [yield](../y/yield.md) or immediate [demand](../d/demand.md) outweighing storage costs. Here, the [futures](../f/futures.md) prices rise over time as they converge with spot prices upon expiration.

### Rolling Contracts
[Futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) have expiration dates, and investors looking to maintain their positions must "roll" the contractsâ€”sell the expiring contract and purchase a new one with a later [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md). This [rollover](../r/rollover.md) involves moving from the front-month contract (nearest to expiry) to the next month or further out.

### Calculation of Roll Yield
The roll [yield](../y/yield.md) is calculated as the difference in price due to rolling over a [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) into another with a later expiry date. Here is the basic formula to compute roll [yield](../y/yield.md):

\[ \text{Roll [Yield](../y/yield.md)} = \frac{F2 - F1}{F1} \]

Where:
- \( F1 \) is the price of the near-month contract.
- \( F2 \) is the price of the next-month contract.

### Example of Roll Yield
Suppose a [trader](../t/trader.md) holds a [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) for [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md) that is in [contango](../c/contango.md):

- The near-month [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) is priced at $70.
- The next-month [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) is priced at $75.

To roll the contract, the [trader](../t/trader.md) sells the $70 contract and buys the $75 contract. The roll [yield](../y/yield.md) here would be:

\[ \text{Roll [Yield](../y/yield.md)} = \frac{75 - 70}{70} = \frac{5}{70} = 0.0714 \text{ or } 7.14\% \]

Since the [market](../m/market.md) is in [contango](../c/contango.md), the roll [yield](../y/yield.md) is negative, indicating a loss on rolling the contract.

## Importance of Roll Yield in Investment Strategies

### Impact on Returns
- **Positive Roll [Yield](../y/yield.md)** (in [backwardation](../b/backwardation.md)): Can enhance returns because the [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) bought for a lower price is expected to converge upwards to the [spot price](../s/spot_price.md).
- **Negative Roll [Yield](../y/yield.md)** (in [contango](../c/contango.md)): Can erode returns because the [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) bought at a higher price is expected to converge downwards to the [spot price](../s/spot_price.md).

### Application in Commodity Funds
[Commodity](../c/commodity.md)-based ETFs ([Exchange](../e/exchange.md)-Traded Funds) and mutual funds often have to roll over contracts systematically. Understanding roll [yield](../y/yield.md) helps in predicting the potential financial impact of these rollovers.

### Algorithmic Trading
In [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), roll [yield](../y/yield.md) forms a part of more extensive models for optimizing [entry and exit strategies](../e/entry_and_exit_strategies.md) in the [futures market](../f/futures_market.md). By calculating expected roll yields, algorithms can make more informed decisions about when to roll contracts.

### Hedging Strategies
For hedgers, roll [yield](../y/yield.md) must be factored into the costs. For example, an oil company hedging its production might face negative roll yields in a [contango](../c/contango.md) [market](../m/market.md), impacting the effectiveness of the hedging strategy.

## Factors Influencing Roll Yield

### Market Expectations
Traders' expectations about future [supply](../s/supply.md) and [demand](../d/demand.md) play a significant role in shaping the [futures](../f/futures.md) curve. These expectations can change due to geopolitical events, economic data releases, and other [market](../m/market.md)-moving news.

### Storage Costs
For commodities, the cost of storage can affect whether a [market](../m/market.md) is in [contango](../c/contango.md) or [backwardation](../b/backwardation.md). High storage costs generally lead to [contango](../c/contango.md).

### Seasonal Patterns
Many commodities exhibit seasonal [demand](../d/demand.md) and [supply](../s/supply.md) patterns which can influence the shape of the [futures](../f/futures.md) curve, thereby affecting roll yields. For instance, agricultural commodities such as corn or wheat may experience different roll yields during planting and harvesting seasons.

## Advanced Concepts Related to Roll Yield

### Collateral Yield
[Collateral](../c/collateral.md) [yield](../y/yield.md) refers to the returns earned on the [collateral](../c/collateral.md) posted for a [futures](../f/futures.md) position. In combination with roll [yield](../y/yield.md), it can significantly influence the overall returns from a [futures](../f/futures.md) investment.

### Convexity Bias
[Convexity](../c/convexity.md) bias arises due to the nonlinear relationship between [futures](../f/futures.md) prices and the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) spot prices. It can introduce additional complexities in calculating and interpreting roll yields, particularly over longer horizons.

### Basis Risk
[Basis risk](../b/basis_risk.md) refers to the [risk](../r/risk.md) that the [spot price](../s/spot_price.md) and the [futures](../f/futures.md) price may not converge as expected at contract expiration. This [risk](../r/risk.md) can impact the realized roll [yield](../y/yield.md).

## Managing Roll Yield

### Timing of Rolls
Strategic timing of rolling contracts can mitigate negative roll yields. Some traders might choose to roll positions when the [futures](../f/futures.md) curve is less steep.

### Using Spread Strategies
Spread strategies, like calendar [spreads](../s/spreads.md), can be employed to take advantage of the differential between near-month and far-month contracts, thereby managing roll [yield](../y/yield.md) more effectively.

### Dynamic Allocation
Dynamic allocation strategies involve adjusting positions based on [market](../m/market.md) conditions to optimize roll [yield](../y/yield.md). These strategies might allocate more funds to contracts with favorable yields and less to those with unfavorable yields.

### Fintech Solutions
Fintech platforms now provide advanced analytical tools to calculate and project roll yields, helping traders and investors make data-driven decisions. These platforms integrate [machine learning algorithms](../m/machine_learning_algorithms_in_trading.md) to predict [market](../m/market.md) conditions and adjust rolling strategies dynamically.

## Conclusion

Roll [yield](../y/yield.md) is a fundamental concept in the [futures market](../f/futures_market.md) that significantly influences the returns on [futures](../f/futures.md) investments. Its importance spans across various trading and investment strategies, from [commodity](../c/commodity.md)-based funds to [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) systems. While negative roll [yield](../y/yield.md) can erode returns in markets experiencing [contango](../c/contango.md), positive roll [yield](../y/yield.md) in [backwardation](../b/backwardation.md) markets can enhance profitability. Understanding and managing roll [yield](../y/yield.md) through strategic timing, spread strategies, and innovative tech solutions are critical for traders aiming to optimize their positions in the complex [futures market](../f/futures_market.md) landscape.

# Relative Strength

Relative Strength (RS) is an essential concept in [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md) and trading, particularly for those who employ [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) and [momentum](../m/momentum.md)-[investing](../i/investing.md) strategies. At its core, relative strength measures the performance of a particular [asset](../a/asset.md) compared to a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) or another [asset](../a/asset.md). This comparison helps traders and investors determine how well an [asset](../a/asset.md) is performing relative to its peers, potentially indicating attractive investment opportunities or highlighting areas of underperformance.

## Definition and Calculation

Relative Strength can be calculated using a variety of methods, but the most straightforward way involves the following formula:

\[ RS = \frac{\text{Price of Asset}}{\text{[Benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) Price}} \]

In this formula:
- **Price of [Asset](../a/asset.md):** The current price of the [asset](../a/asset.md) you are analyzing.
- **[Benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) Price:** The current price of the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) or another [asset](../a/asset.md) against which you are measuring the performance.

For instance, if you want to measure the relative strength of a stock compared to a [market index](../m/market_index.md) like the S&P 500, you would divide the stock's price by the [index](../i/index_instrument.md)'s price. This ratio provides a clear comparison of the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s performance relative to the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md).

## Applications in Trading

### Momentum Trading

Relative Strength is a cornerstone of [momentum trading](../m/momentum_trading.md), a strategy that aims to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on the continuance of existing trends in the [market](../m/market.md). Traders use various RS metrics to identify [robust](../r/robust.md) trends in [stocks](../s/stock.md), commodities, currencies, etc. Hereâ€™s how it works:
1. **Identify Standout Assets:** By comparing different assets within the same sector or [industry](../i/industry.md), traders can spot those outperforming their peers.
2. **Ride the [Trend](../t/trend.md):** [Investing](../i/investing.md) in high relative strength assets can be profitable during [market](../m/market.md) uptrends, as these assets are likely to continue performing well.
3. **Cut Losses:** Conversely, assets with low relative strength can be candidates for [short selling](../s/short_selling.md) or avoidance, as they are likely to continue underperforming.

### Pair Trading

In pair trading, traders choose two assets with historically correlated prices and take opposite positions. The goal is to [profit](../p/profit.md) from the [divergence](../d/divergence.md) between the assets. Relative Strength is vital in identifying which [asset](../a/asset.md) to long and which to short:
- **Strong [Asset](../a/asset.md):** The [asset](../a/asset.md) with higher relative strength is typically bought.
- **Weak [Asset](../a/asset.md):** The [asset](../a/asset.md) with lower relative strength is sold short.

### Sector Rotation

Relative Strength can also guide [sector rotation strategies](../s/sector_rotation_strategies.md), where investors shift investments across different sectors to capture high returns:
- **Outperforming Sectors:** By identifying sectors with high relative strength, investors allocate more [capital](../c/capital.md) into these areas.
- **Underperforming Sectors:** Conversely, they reduce or exit positions in weaker sectors.

## Tools and Indicators

### Relative Strength Index (RSI)

Not to be confused with Relative Strength, the Relative Strength [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (RSI) is a [momentum](../m/momentum.md) [oscillator](../o/oscillator.md) that measures the speed and change of price movements. The RSI is typically used to identify [overbought](../o/overbought.md) or [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions in an [asset](../a/asset.md). Calculated based on the average of upward and downward price changes, RSI is bounded between 0 and 100:
- **[Overbought](../o/overbought.md):** RSI above 70 typically indicates [overbought](../o/overbought.md) conditions.
- **[Oversold](../o/oversold.md):** RSI below 30 often suggests [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions.

### Custom RS Metrics

Many trading platforms and financial software [offer](../o/offer.md) custom relative strength metrics:
- **Moving Averages:** Using moving averages of relative strength can smooth out short-term [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and highlight longer-term trends.
- **Normalized RS:** Some traders normalize relative strength ratios over a specific time frame for more comparability.

### Software and Platforms

Several financial technology companies provide tools and software for measuring and analyzing relative strength:
- **[TradingView](../t/tradingview.md) (https://www.[tradingview](../t/tradingview.md).com/):** Offers a wide array of [technical analysis tools](../t/technical_analysis_tools.md), including relative strength metrics.
- **[Bloomberg Terminal](../b/bloomberg_terminal.md) (https://www.[bloomberg](../b/bloomberg.md).com/professional/solution/[bloomberg](../b/bloomberg.md)-terminal/):** Provides advanced [relative strength analysis](../r/relative_strength_analysis.md) tools for professional traders.

## Advantages and Limitations

### Advantages

- **Objective Measure:** Relative Strength provides an objective way to compare assets, removing emotional biases from the decision-making process.
- **[Trend](../t/trend.md) Identification:** RS helps in identifying and capitalizing on prevailing [market](../m/market.md) trends.
- **Versatility:** Useful across different [asset](../a/asset.md) classes and [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

### Limitations

- **Static Nature:** Simple RS calculations are static and do not account for [volatility](../v/volatility.md) or other dynamic [market](../m/market.md) conditions.
- **Short-term Focus:** High relative strength may not always persist in the long term, making it more suited for short-to-medium-term trading.
- **[Sector Correlation](../s/sector_correlation.md):** In times of [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md), sectors may move together, reducing the [utility](../u/utility.md) of RS.

## Conclusion

Relative Strength is a powerful tool for traders and investors seeking to understand the comparative performance of assets. Whether you're employing it in [momentum trading](../m/momentum_trading.md), pair trading, or [sector rotation](../s/sector_rotation.md), RS can enhance your ability to make informed and profitable trading decisions. However, it's crucial to be aware of its limitations and [complement](../c/complement.md) it with other analytical tools and strategies to maximize its effectiveness.

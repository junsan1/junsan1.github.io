# Reverse Gamma Hedging

## Introduction to Hedging 

Hedging is a form of [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) deployed to offset potential losses in an investment portfolio. In the context of options trading, hedging involves taking an opposing position in a correlated asset to mitigate potential losses. Traditional [hedging strategies](../h/hedging_strategies.md) include [Delta Hedging](../d/delta_hedging.md), [Gamma Hedging](../g/gamma_hedging.md), and Vega Hedging, among others.

## Understanding Gamma in Options Trading

Before diving into Reverse [Gamma Hedging](../g/gamma_hedging.md), it's crucial to understand Gamma in options trading. Gamma (Γ) measures the rate of change of an option's Delta with respect to changes in the price of the underlying asset. It is a second-order Greek metric that provides insights into the curvature of the option's Delta.

### Delta (Δ)

Delta represents the sensitivity of an option's price to small movements in the price of the underlying asset. A Delta of 0.50 implies that for every $1 change in the price of the underlying asset, the option's price is expected to change by $0.50.

### Gamma (Γ)

Gamma shows the rate of change of Delta for a $1 move in the underlying asset's price. High Gamma indicates that Delta changes rapidly, leading to higher risks and potentially higher rewards. Options near expiration and at-the-money generally have higher Gamma.

## Traditional Gamma Hedging

[Gamma Hedging](../g/gamma_hedging.md) aims to neutralize the risk associated with the curvature of an option's Delta. Traders frequently adjust their positions to keep the portfolio Gamma-neutral, which helps in maintaining a stable Delta regardless of the underlying asset's price movements.

### Steps in Gamma Hedging

1. **Calculate [Gamma Exposure](../g/gamma_exposure.md)**: Determine the option's Gamma and its impact on the portfolio.
2. **Adjust Positions**: Execute trades to offset the [Gamma exposure](../g/gamma_exposure.md). Typically, this involves buying or selling options to balance the Gamma.
3. **Continuous Monitoring**: Regularly monitor the portfolio as changes in the underlying asset will affect Gamma, necessitating further adjustments.

## Introduction to Reverse Gamma Hedging

Reverse [Gamma Hedging](../g/gamma_hedging.md) is an advanced hedging technique where the trader aims to benefit from the [Gamma exposure](../g/gamma_exposure.md) rather than neutralizing it. This strategy is implemented primarily in environments with expected high volatility, where rapid changes in the underlying asset's price can be exploited.

### Principle Behind Reverse Gamma Hedging

The concept behind Reverse [Gamma Hedging](../g/gamma_hedging.md) is to intentionally create a position with high Gamma and leverage the frequent adjustments in Delta to capitalize on price movements of the underlying asset. Unlike traditional [Gamma Hedging](../g/gamma_hedging.md), which safeguards against volatility, Reverse [Gamma Hedging](../g/gamma_hedging.md) seeks to profit from it.

### Prerequisites for Reverse Gamma Hedging

1. **High Volatility**: Execute the strategy in markets with expected high volatility.
2. **Quick Execution Capability**: Rapid adjustments in Delta necessitate quick execution and monitoring.
3. **Sufficient Capital**: The strategy requires capital to adjust positions frequently.

### Pros and Cons

#### Pros:
- **Profitable in Volatile Markets**: Benefits from rapid price movements.
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Allows for capitalizing on short-term price changes.

#### Cons:
- **High Risk**: The strategy is riskier, especially in unpredictable markets.
- **Excessive Transactions**: Requires frequent trading, leading to higher transaction costs.

## Implementing Reverse Gamma Hedging

### Step-by-step Guide

1. **Identify High Gamma Options**: Select options with high Gamma, typically near expiration and at-the-money.
2. **Setup Initial Position**: Initiate a position with a deliberate Gamma imbalance.
3. **Dynamic Delta Adjustment**: Continuously adjust Delta positions in response to price movements. This may involve:
   - Buying or selling the underlying asset.
   - Adjusting the amount of options held.
4. **Monitor Market Conditions**: Constantly keep an eye on market volatility and make quick adjustments.
   
### Example Scenario

Imagine you expect significant volatility in the stock of a technology company ahead of its earnings report. You identify near-expiration at-the-money call options with high Gamma:

1. **Initial Position**: Buy a high Gamma call option.
2. **Underlying Moves**: If the stock price rises, the Delta of the call option increases.
3. **Adjust Delta**: As the stock moves, sell some stock or other opposite positions to keep the Delta exposure dynamically beneficial.

## Case Studies in Reverse Gamma Hedging

### Case Study 1: The 2020 Market Volatility

During the period of extreme volatility in early 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, traders successfully implemented Reverse [Gamma Hedging](../g/gamma_hedging.md) strategies by taking positions in highly volatile sectors, such as airlines and technology stocks. The frequent market movements enabled them to profit from accelerated Delta adjustments.

# Reverse Gamma Hedging

## Introduction to Hedging 

Hedging is a form of [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) deployed to [offset](../o/offset.md) potential losses in an investment portfolio. In the context of [options](../o/options.md) trading, hedging involves taking an opposing position in a correlated [asset](../a/asset.md) to mitigate potential losses. Traditional [hedging strategies](../h/hedging_strategies.md) include [Delta Hedging](../d/delta_hedging.md), [Gamma Hedging](../g/gamma_hedging.md), and [Vega](../v/vega.md) Hedging, among others.

## Understanding Gamma in Options Trading

Before diving into Reverse [Gamma Hedging](../g/gamma_hedging.md), it's crucial to understand [Gamma](../g/gamma.md) in [options](../o/options.md) trading. [Gamma](../g/gamma.md) (Γ) measures the rate of change of an option's [Delta](../d/delta.md) with respect to changes in the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). It is a second-[order](../o/order.md) Greek metric that provides insights into the curvature of the option's [Delta](../d/delta.md).

### Delta (Δ)

[Delta](../d/delta.md) represents the sensitivity of an option's price to small movements in the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). A [Delta](../d/delta.md) of 0.50 implies that for every $1 change in the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), the option's price is expected to change by $0.50.

### Gamma (Γ)

[Gamma](../g/gamma.md) shows the rate of change of [Delta](../d/delta.md) for a $1 move in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price. High [Gamma](../g/gamma.md) indicates that [Delta](../d/delta.md) changes rapidly, leading to higher risks and potentially higher rewards. [Options](../o/options.md) near expiration and at-the-[money](../m/money.md) generally have higher [Gamma](../g/gamma.md).

## Traditional Gamma Hedging

[Gamma Hedging](../g/gamma_hedging.md) aims to neutralize the [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with the curvature of an option's [Delta](../d/delta.md). Traders frequently adjust their positions to keep the portfolio [Gamma](../g/gamma.md)-[neutral](../n/neutral.md), which helps in maintaining a stable [Delta](../d/delta.md) regardless of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price movements.

### Steps in Gamma Hedging

1. **Calculate [Gamma Exposure](../g/gamma_exposure.md)**: Determine the option's [Gamma](../g/gamma.md) and its impact on the portfolio.
2. **Adjust Positions**: Execute trades to [offset](../o/offset.md) the [Gamma exposure](../g/gamma_exposure.md). Typically, this involves buying or selling [options](../o/options.md) to balance the [Gamma](../g/gamma.md).
3. **Continuous Monitoring**: Regularly monitor the portfolio as changes in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) [will](../w/will.md) affect [Gamma](../g/gamma.md), necessitating further adjustments.

## Introduction to Reverse Gamma Hedging

Reverse [Gamma Hedging](../g/gamma_hedging.md) is an advanced hedging technique where the [trader](../t/trader.md) aims to benefit from the [Gamma exposure](../g/gamma_exposure.md) rather than neutralizing it. This strategy is implemented primarily in environments with expected high [volatility](../v/volatility.md), where rapid changes in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price can be exploited.

### Principle Behind Reverse Gamma Hedging

The concept behind Reverse [Gamma Hedging](../g/gamma_hedging.md) is to intentionally create a position with high [Gamma](../g/gamma.md) and [leverage](../l/leverage.md) the frequent adjustments in [Delta](../d/delta.md) to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on price movements of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). Unlike traditional [Gamma Hedging](../g/gamma_hedging.md), which safeguards against [volatility](../v/volatility.md), Reverse [Gamma Hedging](../g/gamma_hedging.md) seeks to [profit](../p/profit.md) from it.

### Prerequisites for Reverse Gamma Hedging

1. **High [Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: Execute the strategy in markets with expected high [volatility](../v/volatility.md).
2. **Quick [Execution](../e/execution.md) Capability**: Rapid adjustments in [Delta](../d/delta.md) necessitate quick [execution](../e/execution.md) and monitoring.
3. **Sufficient [Capital](../c/capital.md)**: The strategy requires [capital](../c/capital.md) to adjust positions frequently.

### Pros and Cons

#### Pros:
- **Profitable in Volatile Markets**: Benefits from rapid price movements.
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Allows for capitalizing on short-term price changes.

#### Cons:
- **High [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: The strategy is riskier, especially in unpredictable markets.
- **Excessive Transactions**: Requires frequent trading, leading to higher [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md).

## Implementing Reverse Gamma Hedging

### Step-by-step Guide

1. **Identify High [Gamma](../g/gamma.md) [Options](../o/options.md)**: Select [options](../o/options.md) with high [Gamma](../g/gamma.md), typically near expiration and at-the-[money](../m/money.md).
2. **Setup Initial Position**: Initiate a position with a deliberate [Gamma](../g/gamma.md) imbalance.
3. **Dynamic [Delta](../d/delta.md) Adjustment**: Continuously adjust [Delta](../d/delta.md) positions in response to price movements. This may involve:
   - Buying or selling the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).
   - Adjusting the amount of [options](../o/options.md) held.
4. **Monitor [Market](../m/market.md) Conditions**: Constantly keep an eye on [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and make quick adjustments.
   
### Example Scenario

Imagine you expect significant [volatility](../v/volatility.md) in the stock of a technology company ahead of its [earnings report](../e/earnings_report.md). You identify near-expiration at-the-[money](../m/money.md) call [options](../o/options.md) with high [Gamma](../g/gamma.md):

1. **Initial Position**: Buy a high [Gamma](../g/gamma.md) [call option](../c/call_option.md).
2. **[Underlying](../u/underlying.md) Moves**: If the stock price rises, the [Delta](../d/delta.md) of the [call option](../c/call_option.md) increases.
3. **Adjust [Delta](../d/delta.md)**: As the stock moves, sell some stock or other opposite positions to keep the [Delta](../d/delta.md) exposure dynamically beneficial.

## Case Studies in Reverse Gamma Hedging

### Case Study 1: The 2020 Market Volatility

During the period of extreme [volatility](../v/volatility.md) in early 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, traders successfully implemented Reverse [Gamma Hedging](../g/gamma_hedging.md) strategies by taking positions in highly volatile sectors, such as airlines and technology [stocks](../s/stock.md). The frequent [market](../m/market.md) movements enabled them to [profit](../p/profit.md) from accelerated [Delta](../d/delta.md) adjustments.

## Conclusion

Reverse [Gamma Hedging](../g/gamma_hedging.md) is an advanced strategy suitable for traders with substantial experience in [options](../o/options.md) trading and a high [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md). The technique aims to [leverage](../l/leverage.md) [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md) rather than neutralize it, [offering](../o/offering.md) [lucrative](../l/lucrative.md) opportunities in highly volatile environments. However, it demands rigorous monitoring, quick [execution](../e/execution.md) capabilities, and significant [capital](../c/capital.md) to manage the frequent adjustments required. When executed effectively, Reverse [Gamma Hedging](../g/gamma_hedging.md) can be a potent tool in a [trader](../t/trader.md)'s arsenal.

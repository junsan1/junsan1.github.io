# Raw Beta Analysis

## Introduction

Raw [Beta](../b/beta.md) Analysis is a fundamental concept within the realm of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). [Beta](../b/beta.md) is a measure of a stock's [volatility](../v/volatility.md) in relation to the overall [market](../m/market.md). Raw [Beta](../b/beta.md), in particular, reflects the measure of a stock's or portfolio's [volatility](../v/volatility.md) as compared to a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md), typically without adjustments for more nuanced factors such as [industry](../i/industry.md) comparisons or temporal stability. This analysis is pivotal for traders, investors, and financial analysts who [leverage](../l/leverage.md) it to assess [risk](../r/risk.md), strategize [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md), and optimize portfolios.

## Definition and Concept

[Beta](../b/beta.md), in general, is a statistical measure that compares the [volatility](../v/volatility.md) of a stock or portfolio to that of the wider [market](../m/market.md). A [Beta](../b/beta.md) [value](../v/value.md):
- **Greater than 1**: Indicates that the [asset](../a/asset.md) is more volatile than the [market](../m/market.md).
- **Less than 1**: Indicates that the [asset](../a/asset.md) is less volatile than the [market](../m/market.md).
- **Equal to 1**: Represents an [asset](../a/asset.md) that is as volatile as the [market](../m/market.md).

Raw [Beta](../b/beta.md) specifically refers to the unadjusted [Beta](../b/beta.md) values derived from [regression analysis](../r/regression_analysis.md) based on [historical returns](../h/historical_returns.md) data. While Raw [Beta](../b/beta.md) does not incorporate adjustments, such as sectoral performance or company-specific risks, it provides a fundamental insight into the inherent [market](../m/market.md)-related [volatility](../v/volatility.md) of an [asset](../a/asset.md).

## Calculation

Raw [Beta](../b/beta.md) is typically calculated using [regression analysis](../r/regression_analysis.md), where the returns of an [asset](../a/asset.md) are regressed against the returns of a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [index](../i/index.md) over a certain period. The common mathematical formula for [Beta](../b/beta.md) is:

\[ \[beta](../b/beta.md) = \frac{\text{Cov}(R_i, R_m)}{\text{Var}(R_m)} \]

Where:
- \( R_i \) denotes the [return](../r/return.md) of the [asset](../a/asset.md).
- \( R_m \) represents the [return](../r/return.md) of the [market index](../m/market_index.md).
- Cov is the [covariance](../c/covariance.md) between the returns of the [asset](../a/asset.md) and the [market](../m/market.md).
- Var is the variance of the [market](../m/market.md) returns.

## Practical Application

### Algorithmic Trading

In [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), Raw [Beta](../b/beta.md) is a critical input for [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) and strategy development. Traders can adjust their algorithms to mitigate [risk](../r/risk.md) by targeting assets with desired [Beta](../b/beta.md) values. For example, [risk-averse](../r/risk-averse.md) algorithms may prioritize low [Beta](../b/beta.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) to minimize exposure to [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

### Portfolio Optimization

In [portfolio management](../p/portfolio_management.md), Raw [Beta](../b/beta.md) assists in creating a balanced portfolio. By examining the [Beta](../b/beta.md) values of various assets, managers can devise a diversified portfolio that aligns with the [investor](../i/investor.md)’s [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md). Combining assets with varying [Beta](../b/beta.md) values can help in achieving the desired level of [market exposure](../m/market_exposure.md) and [risk](../r/risk.md) reduction.

### Risk Assessment

Raw [Beta](../b/beta.md) plays a crucial role in [risk](../r/risk.md) assessment frameworks. Identifying high [Beta](../b/beta.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) helps in understanding potential vulnerabilities in periods of [market](../m/market.md) downturns. Conversely, low [Beta](../b/beta.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) insights into stable investments.

## Limitations

Though Raw [Beta](../b/beta.md) offers valuable insights, it comes with certain limitations:
- **Lack of Adjustments**: Raw [Beta](../b/beta.md) does not account for factors like [industry](../i/industry.md)-specific risks or temporal stability. Adjusted [Beta](../b/beta.md), on the other hand, factors in these nuances.
- **Historical [Basis](../b/basis.md)**: As Raw [Beta](../b/beta.md) is based on historical data, it may not accurately predict future [volatility](../v/volatility.md), especially in dynamically changing [market](../m/market.md) conditions.
- **Single Measure**: [Beta](../b/beta.md) captures only one dimension of [risk](../r/risk.md)—[market risk](../m/market_risk.md). It does not consider other [risk factors](../r/risk_factors_in_trading.md) such as company-specific events or macroeconomic changes.

## Case Study: A Simple Regression Analysis

Let’s consider a simplified example of Raw [Beta](../b/beta.md) calculation through [regression analysis](../r/regression_analysis.md) using historical data for a hypothetical stock and the S&P 500 [index](../i/index.md).

- Extract monthly returns for both the stock and the S&P 500 over a period of 5 years.
- Perform a simple ordinary least square (OLS) regression where the dependent variable is the stock's returns and the independent variable is the S&P 500's returns.
- The slope of the regression line represents the Raw [Beta](../b/beta.md).

### Steps in Python

```python
[import](../i/import.md) numpy as np
[import](../i/import.md) pandas as pd
[import](../i/import.md) statsmodels.api as sm

# Hypothetical returns data
data = {
    'stock_returns': np.random.random(60),
    'market_returns': np.random.random(60)
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Regression analysis
x = df['market_returns']
y = df['stock_returns']
x = sm.add_constant(x)  # Adding a constant term for the intercept

model = sm.OLS(y, x).fit()
[beta](../b/beta.md) = model.params[1]

print(f'Raw [Beta](../b/beta.md): {[beta](../b/beta.md)}')
```

This script, while simplified, captures the essence of Raw [Beta](../b/beta.md) calculation through a straightforward regression of stock returns against [market](../m/market.md) returns.

# Roth IRA

A Roth Individual Retirement Account (IRA) is a type of retirement [savings account](../s/savings_account.md) that allows individuals to contribute after-tax dollars and then withdraw the contributions and [earnings](../e/earnings.md) [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md) in retirement. Established by the [Taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) Relief Act of 1997, the Roth IRA was named after Senator William Roth of Delaware. It is a powerful tool for individuals seeking [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md) growth on their investments.

## Key Features of a Roth IRA

### Tax Advantages
Unlike traditional IRAs, contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars, meaning that you do not get a [tax deduction](../t/tax_deduction.md) when you contribute. However, the main advantage is that qualified withdrawals are [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md). This includes both the contributions and any [earnings](../e/earnings.md).

### Contribution Limits
The IRS sets annual contribution limits for Roth IRAs. For 2023, the maximum amount you can contribute is $6,500, or $7,500 if you are age 50 or older. These limits can change from year to year based on [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

### Income Limits
Eligibility to contribute to a Roth IRA is subject to [income](../i/income.md) limits. For 2023, the [income](../i/income.md) phase-out ranges are as follows:
- Single filers: $138,000 to $153,000
- [Married filing jointly](../m/married_filing_jointly.md): $218,000 to $228,000

### Withdrawal Rules
- **Qualified Distributions:** Withdrawals that occur after age 59½, after a 5-year [holding period](../h/holding_period.md), can be made [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md).
- **Non-Qualified Distributions:** Withdrawals made before age 59½ may be subject to [taxes](../t/taxes.md) and a 10% early [withdrawal penalty](../w/withdrawal_penalty.md).

### No Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)
Unlike traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs do not have Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) during the account holder’s lifetime. This allows the account to grow [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md) for a longer period, benefiting those who do not need the funds immediately upon reaching retirement age.

### Contributions After Age 70½
Another advantage is that you can continue to contribute to a Roth IRA as long as you have [earned income](../e/earned_income.md), even if you are over 70½ years old.

## Advantages of Roth IRA

### Tax-Free Growth
One of the most compelling reasons to choose a Roth IRA is the potential for [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md) growth. Once you’ve paid [taxes](../t/taxes.md) on the [money](../m/money.md) you contribute, you won’t owe additional [taxes](../t/taxes.md) when you withdraw those funds in retirement.

### Flexibility
Roth IRAs [offer](../o/offer.md) flexibility. Since contributions (but not [earnings](../e/earnings.md)) can be withdrawn at any time without [taxes](../t/taxes.md) or penalties, they can also serve as an [emergency fund](../e/emergency_fund.md).

### Estate Planning
Roth IRAs can be beneficial for [estate planning](../e/estate_planning.md). Because they don’t have RMDs, you can leave the funds to your heirs, and they can continue to enjoy [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md) growth.

## Potential Drawbacks

### No Immediate Tax Benefit
One downside is that contributions are made with after-tax dollars, meaning you don’t get an immediate [tax break](../t/tax_break.md). If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a [traditional IRA](../t/traditional_ira.md) might provide more immediate [tax relief](../t/tax_relief.md).

### Income Limits
High earners may not be eligible to contribute directly to a Roth IRA due to [income](../i/income.md) limits. However, they may consider a "backdoor" Roth IRA, which involves contributing to a [traditional IRA](../t/traditional_ira.md) and then converting it to a Roth.

### Contribution Limits
The contribution limits to Roth IRAs are relatively low compared to other retirement accounts like 401(k)s. This can be a limitation for high savers.

## Strategies for Funding a Roth IRA

### Regular Contributions
One straightforward strategy is to make regular contributions up to the maximum limit each year. This approach benefits from dollar-cost averaging.

### Roth Conversions
Another option is to convert [traditional IRA](../t/traditional_ira.md) or 401(k) dollars to a Roth IRA. This requires paying [taxes](../t/taxes.md) on the converted amount but can be beneficial for those expecting higher tax rates in the future.

### Spousal Contributions
Even if one spouse does not earn [income](../i/income.md), they can still contribute to a Roth IRA based on the [earned income](../e/earned_income.md) of the working spouse. This is known as a spousal IRA.

## Investment Options

### Stocks and Mutual Funds
Roth IRAs typically [offer](../o/offer.md) a broad [range](../r/range.md) of investment [options](../o/options.md), including individual [stocks](../s/stock.md), mutual funds, and ETFs. The choice of investments [will](../w/will.md) depend on your [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) and [time horizon](../t/time_horizon.md).

### Bonds
You can also invest in bonds within a Roth IRA. Bonds are generally considered a safer investment compared to [stocks](../s/stock.md) and can provide a steady [income](../i/income.md) stream.

### Rebalancing
Regular [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) can help to keep your investment portfolio aligned with your retirement goals. This involves periodically adjusting the mix of assets to maintain your desired level of [risk](../r/risk.md).

## Conclusion

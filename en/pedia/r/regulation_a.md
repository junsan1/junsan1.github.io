# Regulation A

Regulation A, often referred to as "Reg A," is a set of rules under the JOBS Act that allows small and medium-sized companies to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) from the public with a simplified process compared to traditional initial public offerings (IPOs). This regulation, governed by the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC), aims to make it easier for smaller companies to access funding while still providing [investor](../i/investor.md) protection. Reg A offerings are often considered a middle ground between private placements and public offerings, [offering](../o/offering.md) more flexibility and fewer regulatory hurdles.

## Definition

Regulation A is an [exemption](../e/exemption.md) from registration for public offerings, meaning that companies can sell their [shares](../s/shares.md) to the general public without the need to undergo the full SEC registration process that is typically required for an IPO. The key features of Reg A offerings include:

- **Public [Offering](../o/offering.md)**: Unlike private placements that are restricted to accredited investors, Reg A allows companies to solicit investments from the general public.
- **Simplified Reporting**: Companies conducting Reg A offerings face less stringent reporting requirements compared to those conducting a traditional IPO.
- **Testing the Waters**: Before formally filing with the SEC, companies can solicit [interest](../i/interest.md) from potential investors to gauge [market](../m/market.md) [demand](../d/demand.md).

## Update

The SEC periodically updates the rules governing Regulation A to make it more attractive for smaller companies and to protect investors. One significant update came in March 2021, when the SEC increased the maximum [offering](../o/offering.md) size under Tier 2 from $50 million to $75 million. This update was part of broader changes aimed at facilitating [capital](../c/capital.md) formation while maintaining important [investor](../i/investor.md) protections.

## Documentation

To conduct a Regulation A [offering](../o/offering.md), companies must prepare and file several documents with the SEC:

1. **[Offering Circular](../o/offering_circular.md)**: This is the primary [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) document and is similar to a [prospectus](../p/prospectus.md) used in a traditional IPO. It includes information about the company's [business](../b/business.md), management, [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md), and the terms of the [offering](../o/offering.md).

2. **Form 1-A**: This form is the application for a Regulation A [offering](../o/offering.md). It includes the [offering circular](../o/offering_circular.md) and other required information, such as the use of proceeds, legal matters, and any exhibits or schedules.

3. **[Financial Statements](../f/financial_statements.md)**: Depending on the tier under which the [offering](../o/offering.md) is conducted, the [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) must be either reviewed or audited by an independent [accountant](../a/accountant.md). 

4. **Periodic Reports**: Companies conducting a Regulation A [offering](../o/offering.md) are required to file ongoing reports with the SEC, which may include annual and semi-annual reports (for Tier 2 offerings) and current event reports.

## Tiers

Regulation A offerings are divided into two tiers, each with different requirements and limitations:

### Tier 1

- **[Offering](../o/offering.md) Limit**: Up to $20 million in a 12-month period.
- **[Investor](../i/investor.md) Limits**: No investment limits for individual investors.
- **[Disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) Requirements**: Requires [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) that are reviewed (but not audited) by an independent [accountant](../a/accountant.md).
- **State Securities Laws**: Subject to state securities law registration and qualification requirements, also known as "Blue Sky" laws.
- **Ongoing Reporting**: Less frequent reporting requirements compared to Tier 2, no ongoing reporting to the SEC after the [offering](../o/offering.md) is completed.

### Tier 2

- **[Offering](../o/offering.md) Limit**: Up to $75 million in a 12-month period.
- **[Investor](../i/investor.md) Limits**: Non-accredited investors cannot invest more than 10% of their annual [income](../i/income.md) or [net worth](../n/net_worth.md), whichever is greater.
- **[Disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) Requirements**: Requires [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) that are audited by an independent [accountant](../a/accountant.md).
- **State Securities Laws**: Exempt from state [Blue Sky laws](../b/blue_sky_laws.md), making it easier to conduct offerings across [multiple](../m/multiple.md) states.
- **Ongoing Reporting**: More rigorous ongoing reporting requirements, including annual reports on Form 1-K, semi-annual reports on Form 1-SA, and current event reports on Form 1-U.

## Companies Utilizing Regulation A

Several companies have taken advantage of Regulation A to raise [capital](../c/capital.md). Notable examples include:

- **Elio Motors**: An American automotive [startup](../s/startup.md) that used a Reg A+ [offering](../o/offering.md) to raise over $17 million for the development of its three-wheeled vehicle.
- **StartEngine**: A [crowdfunding](../c/crowdfunding.md) platform that allows startups to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) through Reg A offerings. (https://www.startengine.com)

By providing a streamlined process for raising [capital](../c/capital.md) from the public, Regulation A serves as a valuable tool for companies looking to grow while maintaining a level of [investor](../i/investor.md) protection mandated by the SEC.

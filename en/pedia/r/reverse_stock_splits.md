# Reverse Stock Splits

### Introduction

Reverse stock splits, also known as reverse splits, reverse split ratio, or stock consolidations, are corporate actions in which a company reduces the number of its outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md) while proportionally increasing the share price. Unlike a regular [stock split](../s/stock_split.md), where [shares](../s/shares.md) are multiplied (e.g., a 2-for-1 split would turn one share into two), reverse splits perform division (e.g., a 1-for-2 reverse split would turn two [shares](../s/shares.md) into one). The most common reasons for engaging in reverse stock splits are to attract institutional investors, reduce [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) [dilution](../d/dilution.md), and meet stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md) [listing requirements](../l/listing_requirements.md).

### Mechanism of Reverse Stock Splits

During a [reverse stock split](../r/reverse_stock_split.md), a company decides on a split ratio, such as 1-for-10, and shareholders receive one new share for every ten [shares](../s/shares.md) they previously owned. Consequently, if an [investor](../i/investor.md) owned 1,000 [shares](../s/shares.md) before the split, they would own 100 [shares](../s/shares.md) after a 1-for-10 split. Importantly, the total [value](../v/value.md) of the [shares](../s/shares.md) held by an [investor](../i/investor.md) remains the same immediately following a reverse split, though individual share prices increase. For instance, if [shares](../s/shares.md) were trading at $1 before a 1-for-10 reverse split, they would [trade](../t/trade.md) at $10 after the split.

### Purpose and Rationale

Several practical reasons lead companies to enact reverse stock splits:

1. **Compliance with Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) Rules**: Stock exchanges often have minimum [bid price](../b/bid_price.md) requirements for listing. For example, the [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md) requires a minimum [bid price](../b/bid_price.md) of $1. Companies whose stock prices fall below this threshold may face [delisting](../d/delisting.md). A [reverse stock split](../r/reverse_stock_split.md) helps in maintaining compliance with these rules. More about [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md) [listing requirements](../l/listing_requirements.md) can be found [here](https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/assets/initialguide.pdf).

2. **Attracting Institutional Investors**: Many institutional investors, including mutual funds and [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds, have policies against buying [low-priced stocks](../l/low-priced_stocks.md). By raising the stock price through a reverse split, companies hope to attract more institutional investment.

3. **Reducing [Shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) [Dilution](../d/dilution.md)**: When a company has a large number of outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md), each share represents a smaller portion of the company. A reverse split consolidates the [shares](../s/shares.md), potentially making each share more valuable and less diluted.

4. **Psychological and Perceptual Benefits**: Some companies believe that higher-priced [stocks](../s/stock.md) are perceived as being of higher quality. The increased share price resulting from a reverse split can improve the stock’s image among potential investors.

### Effects on Shareholders and Market Perception

#### Immediate Effects

- **Share Count and Price Adjustment**: Shareholders [will](../w/will.md) see a reduction in the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) they own and an increase in the price per share. The overall [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) of the company remains [unchanged](../u/unchanged.md).

- **Fractional [Shares](../s/shares.md)**: Reverse splits can result in fractional [shares](../s/shares.md), which are typically rounded up or down. Companies may compensate shareholders for fractional [shares](../s/shares.md) with cash.

#### Long-Term Effects

- **[Investor](../i/investor.md) Sentiment**: The long-term effects on [investor](../i/investor.md) sentiment can be mixed. While a reverse split can enhance a stock’s attractiveness by increasing its price, it may also be perceived as a sign that the company is struggling.

- **[Market](../m/market.md) Reactions**: Historically, markets have been cautious of reverse stock splits. Studies have shown that [stocks](../s/stock.md) undergoing reverse splits can [underperform](../u/underperform.md) in subsequent periods.

#### Potential Risks

- **Negative Perception**: Reverse splits might be interpreted as an attempt to artificially inflate the stock price, possibly leading to negative [investor](../i/investor.md) sentiment.

- **Volatile Trading**: Lower-priced [stocks](../s/stock.md) that engage in reverse splits might experience increased [volatility](../v/volatility.md) as traders react to the new price levels.

### Examples of Reverse Stock Splits

1. **General Electric (GE)**: In 2021, GE enacted a 1-for-8 [reverse stock split](../r/reverse_stock_split.md). This move aimed to reduce the number of outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md) and increase the stock price to meet internal objectives and [market](../m/market.md) expectations. More details can be found on their [investor relations page](https://www.ge.com/investor-relations).

2. **Citigroup (C)**: In 2011, Citigroup executed a 1-for-10 [reverse stock split](../r/reverse_stock_split.md) to enhance its stock price, which had significantly fallen during the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md). For further details, see Citigroup’s [investor information](https://www.citigroup.com/citi/investor/).

### Conclusion

Reverse stock splits serve as a strategic tool for companies to meet regulatory requirements, improve [market](../m/market.md) perceptions, and attract a broader [investor](../i/investor.md) base. While they can [yield](../y/yield.md) benefits such as increased stock prices and compliance with listing standards, they also carry risks, including potential negative [market](../m/market.md) reactions and [volatility](../v/volatility.md). Understanding the motivations and potential consequences of reverse stock splits can help investors make informed decisions and better navigate [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md).

### Key Considerations for Investors

1. **Historical Performance**: Investigate how the company's stock has performed historically, particularly before and after significant events such as reverse splits.

2. **[Fundamental Analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md)**: Evaluate the company's fundamentals, rather than relying solely on stock price movements, to gauge its true [value](../v/value.md) and potential for future growth.

3. **[Market](../m/market.md) Conditions**: Consider broader [market](../m/market.md) conditions and [industry](../i/industry.md)-specific factors that may influence the success and impact of a [reverse stock split](../r/reverse_stock_split.md).
   
By doing so, investors can mitigate risks and [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on potential opportunities arising from reverse stock splits.

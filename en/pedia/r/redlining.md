# Redlining

Redlining is a discriminatory practice in [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), typically involving the systematic denial of various services by federal government agencies, local governments, or the [private sector](../p/private_sector.md), either directly or indirectly, to residents of certain areas based on their race or ethnicity. This practice has deep roots in the history of the United States and has had significant implications for urban development, [financial inclusion](../f/financial_inclusion.md), and social [equity](../e/equity.md).

## Historical Background

The term "redlining" originates from the 1930s when the [Home](../h/home.md) Owners' [Loan](../l/loan.md) [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) (HOLC) created "residential [security](../s/security.md) maps" to indicate the level of [security](../s/security.md) for [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) investments in various areas of major cities. These maps color-coded neighborhoods:
- Green: Best
- Blue: Still Desirable
- Yellow: Definitely Declining
- Red: Hazardous

Neighborhoods colored in red were typically inhabited by African Americans and other minority groups, and consequently, these areas were often denied mortgages, [insurance](../i/insurance.md), and other financial services.

## The Mechanics of Redlining

### Mortgage Denial

Financial institutions would refuse to [grant](../g/grant.md) mortgages or even provide basic financial services in neighborhoods marked as "high-[risk](../r/risk.md)." This perpetuated a cycle where these communities were starved for investment, causing property values to decline and disincentivizing improvements.

### Insurance and Loan Discrimination

Additionally, [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies would often refuse to underwrite policies or would charge prohibitively high premiums, further excluding certain neighborhoods from opportunities for [home](../h/home.md) and [business](../b/business.md) ownership. Similarly, personal and [business](../b/business.md) loans were often denied, exacerbating economic inequalities.

### Urban Planning and Zoning

Urban planners and municipalities also played roles by enacting [zoning](../z/zoning.md) laws and building codes that, whether intentionally or unintentionally, maintained segregation. [Infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) developments, such as highways, were often designed to separate or isolate minority neighborhoods, reducing their access to resources and opportunities.

## Economic and Social Implications

### Wealth Inequality

One of the most profound consequences of redlining is its contribution to the racial [wealth](../w/wealth.md) gap. Homeownership is one of the primary means of [wealth](../w/wealth.md) accumulation in the United States. By denying African American families and other minorities access to mortgages, redlining limited their ability to build, [leverage](../l/leverage.md), and transfer [wealth](../w/wealth.md) across generations.

### Community Investment

Redlined communities saw fewer investments in general [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md), education, and public services. The lack of [capital](../c/capital.md) inflow also meant fewer businesses and job opportunities, which further stifed [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) and development in these areas.

### Long-term Psychological Effects

Constant financial rejection has a psychological toll. Communities that were perpetually denied opportunities often internalized a sense of inferiority and hopelessness, which could affect social cohesion and ambition on a community-wide level.

## Legal and Legislative Responses

Recognizing the injustice of these practices, significant legislation has been enacted to combat redlining and its ramifications.

### Fair Housing Act (1968)

The Fair Housing Act was among the first significant laws aimed directly at combatting discrimination in housing. It prohibited discrimination on the [basis](../b/basis.md) of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in the [sale](../s/sale.md), rental, or [financing](../f/financing.md) of housing.

### Community Reinvestment Act (1977)

The Community [Reinvestment](../r/reinvestment.md) Act (CRA) was specifically designed to address the inequities of redlining. The CRA requires that federally insured [depository](../d/depository.md) institutions meet the [credit](../c/credit.md) needs of all communities in which they operate, including low- and moderate-[income](../i/income.md) neighborhoods.

### Legal Cases

Legal cases such as "Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman" (1982) and "Jones v. Mayer Co." (1968) have further solidified the legal framework against discriminatory practices in [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) and [finance](../f/finance.md).

## Modern-Day Redlining

Despite legislative progress, forms of redlining continue to exist:

### Digital Redlining

In the age of [Big Data](../b/big_data_in_trading.md), redlining has adapted to new technologies. Digital redlining involves discriminatory practices where [marketing](../m/marketing.md) algorithms or digital platforms deny services based on users' locations, internet usage, or other data proxies.

### Predatory Lending

In the lead-up to the 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md), predatory lending practices disproportionately targeted minority communities, [offering](../o/offering.md) subprime mortgages with unfavorable terms.

### Algorithmic Bias

Algorithms used in [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) lending, [credit](../c/credit.md) scoring, and even predictive policing sometimes exhibit biases that replicate the effects of traditional redlining. These biases can arise either through flawed data inputs or through discriminatory design.

## Moving Forward

### Financial Literacy

[Investing](../i/investing.md) in [financial literacy](../f/financial_literacy.md) for residents of historically redlined neighborhoods can empower them to make informed decisions and effectively advocate for their rights.

### Community Development

Government and [private sector](../p/private_sector.md) collaboration on community development initiatives can revitalize underserved neighborhoods. Programs aimed at [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) improvements, [business](../b/business.md) incentives, and educational enhancements are essential.

### Technological Fairness

Ensuring fairness and [transparency](../t/transparency.md) in algorithmic decision-making is crucial. Policies and frameworks should be developed to audit and rectify algorithmic biases in [finance](../f/finance.md) and [real estate](../r/real_estate.md).

## Conclusion

Redlining is a practice with significant historical roots and modern implications, deeply affecting the economic and social fabric of communities. While legislative measures have made strides in combatting explicit forms of discrimination, continuing vigilance, education, and reform are necessary to address emerging forms and ensure equitable access to opportunities for all.

# Return and Risk Analysis

### Introduction

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), also known as algo-trading or black-box trading, leverages [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md) and automated systems to execute trades in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). By utilizing algorithms — predefined sets of rules and computations — traders can systematically accomplish tasks at speeds and frequencies unachievable by human traders. A critical aspect of this process is the analysis of **[return](../r/return.md) and [risk](../r/risk.md)**, as they play essential roles in devising and optimizing [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

### Return Metrics

1. **Absolute Returns**
   - Measures the total [gain](../g/gain.md) or loss from an investment over a specific period.
   - Calculation: $$ R = \frac{(E - B)}{B} $$
     - $R$ = [Return](../r/return.md)
     - $E$ = Ending [value](../v/value.md)
     - $B$ = Beginning [value](../v/value.md)
2. **Annualized Returns**
   - Adjusted returns to reflect a standard one-year period, accommodating comparisons across different time spans.
   - Calculation: $$ AR = (1 + R)^{\frac{1}{N}} - 1 $$
     - $AR$ = Annualized [Return](../r/return.md)
     - $R$ = Periodic [return](../r/return.md)
     - $N$ = Number of periods per year
3. **Excess Returns**
   - The [return](../r/return.md) of an investment over a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) such as a [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate or [market index](../m/market_index.md).
   - Calculation: $$ ER = R - BR $$
     - $ER$ = [Excess Return](../e/excess_return.md)
     - $R$ = [Return](../r/return.md) of the investment
     - $BR$ = [Benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [Return](../r/return.md)

### Risk Metrics

1. **[Standard Deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md)**
   - Measures the [dispersion](../d/dispersion.md) of [return](../r/return.md) values around the mean, providing a quantifiable estimate of total [risk](../r/risk.md).
   - Calculation: 
     $$ \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (R_i - \bar{R})^2} $$
   - $\sigma$ = [Standard Deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md)
   - $R_i$ = Individual returns
   - $\bar{R}$ = Mean [return](../r/return.md)
   - $N$ = Number of returns

2. **[Value](../v/value.md) at [Risk](../r/risk.md) (VaR)**
   - Estimates the potential loss in [value](../v/value.md) of a portfolio under normal [market](../m/market.md) conditions over a set time period, given a confidence level.
   - Methods: [Historical Simulation](../h/historical_simulation.md), Variance-[Covariance](../c/covariance.md), [Monte Carlo Simulation](../m/monte_carlo_simulation.md)
3. **[Beta Coefficient](../b/beta_coefficient.md) (β)**
   - Measures a portfolio's [volatility](../v/volatility.md) in relation to the overall [market](../m/market.md).
   - Calculation: 
     $$ \[beta](../b/beta.md) = \frac{\text{Cov}(R_p, R_m)}{\sigma_m^2} $$
   - $\[beta](../b/beta.md)$ = [Beta coefficient](../b/beta_coefficient.md)
   - $R_p$ = [Return](../r/return.md) of the portfolio
   - $R_m$ = [Return](../r/return.md) of the [market](../m/market.md)
   - $\sigma_m$ = [Standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) of the [market](../m/market.md) returns
4. **[Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md)**
   - Assesses [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted performance by adjusting returns for [risk](../r/risk.md).
   - Calculation:
     $$ S = \frac{(R_p - R_f)}{\sigma_p} $$
   - $S$ = [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md)
   - $R_p$ = [Return](../r/return.md) of the portfolio
   - $R_f$ = [Risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate
   - $\sigma_p$ = [Standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) of portfolio [return](../r/return.md)
5. **[Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md)**
   - Similar to [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) but considers only downside [volatility](../v/volatility.md), differentiating between harmful [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and general [volatility](../v/volatility.md).
   - Calculation: 
     $$ SR = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_d} $$
   - $SR$ = [Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md)
   - $R_p$ = [Return](../r/return.md) of the portfolio
   - $R_f$ = [Risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate
   - $\sigma_d$ = [Standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) of downside returns
6. **Max [Drawdown](../d/drawdown.md) (MDD)**
   - Represents the maximum observed loss from a peak to a [trough](../t/trough.md) in a portfolio.
   - Calculation: 
     $$ MDD = \frac{[Trough](../t/trough.md) [Value](../v/value.md) - Peak [Value](../v/value.md)}{Peak [Value](../v/value.md)} $$

   - Investigates impacts of specific hypothetical events or conditions on [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

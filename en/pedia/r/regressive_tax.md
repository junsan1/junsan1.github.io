# Regressive Tax

A regressive tax is a type of tax that takes a larger percentage of [income](../i/income.md) from low-[income](../i/income.md) earners than from high-[income](../i/income.md) earners. This type of tax can disproportionately affect those who are less capable of paying it, thereby increasing economic inequality. Regressive [taxes](../t/taxes.md) are often contrasted with progressive [taxes](../t/taxes.md), which impose a higher [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md) on higher-[income](../i/income.md) earners.

## Definition

In [economics](../e/economics.md), a regressive tax is one where the [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md) decreases as the taxable amount increases. Essentially, as you earn more, the proportion of your [income](../i/income.md) paid in [taxes](../t/taxes.md) decreases. This regressive nature can occur through direct [taxes](../t/taxes.md), such as specific types of [income](../i/income.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md), or indirect [taxes](../t/taxes.md), such as sales [taxes](../t/taxes.md).

## Characteristics

1. **Disproportionate Impact**: Regressive [taxes](../t/taxes.md) place a heavier burden on those who earn less. For example, a flat [sales tax](../s/sales_tax.md) on goods affects lower-[income](../i/income.md) individuals more because they spend a higher percentage of their [income](../i/income.md) on consumables.

2. **Flat Rates**: Regressive [taxes](../t/taxes.md) often have a flat rate, meaning the same percentage or amount is levied regardless of the individual's [income](../i/income.md).

3. **Fairness Debate**: These types of [taxes](../t/taxes.md) are often criticized for being unfair and exacerbating [income inequality](../i/income_inequality.md). However, some argue that they are simpler to administer and harder to evade.

## Types of Regressive Taxes

### Sales Taxes

Sales [taxes](../t/taxes.md) are a primary example of regressive [taxes](../t/taxes.md). Everyone pays the same percentage rate on purchases, regardless of [income](../i/income.md) level. For instance, if the [sales tax](../s/sales_tax.md) rate is 6%, both a wealthy individual and a low-[income](../i/income.md) person pay the same rate on [consumer goods](../c/consumer_goods.md). However, the tax takes a bigger chunk out of the lower-[income](../i/income.md) individual's total [earnings](../e/earnings.md).

### Excise Taxes

Excise [taxes](../t/taxes.md) are specific [taxes](../t/taxes.md) imposed on particular goods, such as gasoline, tobacco, and alcohol. These [taxes](../t/taxes.md) are considered regressive because lower-[income](../i/income.md) individuals tend to spend a higher proportion of their [income](../i/income.md) on these goods compared to wealthier individuals.

### Payroll Taxes

[Payroll](../p/payroll.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md), such as [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) and Medicare in the United States, are somewhat regressive. In the U.S., there is a cap beyond which no additional [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) tax is paid. As a result, higher earners contribute a smaller proportion of their [income](../i/income.md) to these types of [taxes](../t/taxes.md) than lower earners.

### Property Taxes

Property [taxes](../t/taxes.md) can also be regressive, particularly in areas where property values do not increase uniformly with [income](../i/income.md) levels. In some cases, lower-[income](../i/income.md) households may end up paying a higher percentage of their [income](../i/income.md) on property [taxes](../t/taxes.md) compared to higher-[income](../i/income.md) households.

### Flat Taxes

Flat [taxes](../t/taxes.md) impose the same [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md) on all levels of [income](../i/income.md). For example, if a country imposes a flat [income tax](../i/income_tax.md) rate of 15%, both a person earning $20,000 and another earning $200,000 [will](../w/will.md) pay the same 15% rate. While flat [taxes](../t/taxes.md) are straightforward, they tend to be regressive because lower-[income](../i/income.md) individuals lose a larger share of their [earnings](../e/earnings.md) compared to wealthier individuals.

### Consumption Taxes

Various consumption [taxes](../t/taxes.md), like [Value](../v/value.md)-Added Tax (VAT) or Goods and Services Tax (GST), are also regressive in nature. These types of [taxes](../t/taxes.md) are levied on the purchase of goods and services and, like sales [taxes](../t/taxes.md), take up a larger proportion of the [income](../i/income.md) of lower earners.

## Examples in Specific Countries

### United States

In the U.S., several regressive [taxes](../t/taxes.md) are in place. For instance, state and local sales [taxes](../t/taxes.md) are often criticized for being regressive. [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) tax also has a cap, making it less progressive.

### United Kingdom

In the UK, [Value](../v/value.md)-Added Tax (VAT) is considered regressive. Although some goods and services are exempt or reduced, the standard VAT rate applies uniformly, impacting lower-[income](../i/income.md) households more significantly.

### Canada

Canada's Goods and Services Tax (GST) works similarly to VAT and is viewed as regressive. Certain provinces levy additional sales [taxes](../t/taxes.md), further affecting lower-[income](../i/income.md) earners.

### Australia

In Australia, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) operates uniformly across the board. Similar to other VAT or GST systems, it is seen as regressive because it takes a more substantial proportion of [income](../i/income.md) from lower earners.

## Arguments for Regressive Taxes

1. **Simplicity**: Regressive [taxes](../t/taxes.md) like sales and excise [taxes](../t/taxes.md) are easier to administer, requiring less complex systems for collection and enforcement.

2. **Broad [Tax Base](../t/tax_base.md)**: These [taxes](../t/taxes.md) often have a broad base, meaning they can generate significant [revenue](../r/revenue.md) from many small transactions.

3. **Discouragement of Certain Goods**: Excise [taxes](../t/taxes.md) can help dissuade the consumption of harmful goods such as tobacco and alcohol.

## Criticisms

1. **Economic Inequality**: Regressive [taxes](../t/taxes.md) contribute to economic inequality by placing a higher relative burden on lower-[income](../i/income.md) earners.

2. **Consumer Impact**: They can reduce the [disposable income](../d/disposable_income.md) of lower earners, impacting their ability to afford essentials.

3. **Public Perception**: Regressive [taxes](../t/taxes.md) are often politically unpopular because they are seen as unfair and disproportionately burdensome.

## Mitigating Measures

### Tax Credits and Rebates

Governments can [offer](../o/offer.md) tax credits or rebates to low-[income](../i/income.md) households to [offset](../o/offset.md) the impact of regressive [taxes](../t/taxes.md). For example, the [Earned Income](../e/earned_income.md) [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md) (EITC) in the U.S. provides financial relief to low-[income](../i/income.md) workers.

### Exemptions and Lower Rates for Essentials

Exempting essential goods and services, like basic groceries and medicines, from [sales tax](../s/sales_tax.md) can help mitigate the regressive impact of these [taxes](../t/taxes.md).

### Progressive Income Taxes

Implementing a progressive [income tax](../i/income_tax.md) system alongside regressive [taxes](../t/taxes.md) can help balance the overall tax burden, ensuring that higher earners contribute more to the [revenue](../r/revenue.md) system.

**In Conclusion**

While regressive [taxes](../t/taxes.md) have their advantages in terms of simplicity and broad base, they are often criticized for exacerbating economic inequalities. Policymakers must consider the regressive effects of such [taxes](../t/taxes.md) and look for ways to mitigate their impact on lower-[income](../i/income.md) earners. By implementing measures like tax credits, rebates, and progressive [taxation](../t/taxation.md), governments can create a more balanced and equitable tax system.

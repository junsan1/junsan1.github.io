# Revaluation Reserve

## Introduction
The [revaluation](../r/revaluation.md) reserve is a [financial accounting](../f/financial_accounting.md) concept used to account for changes in the [market value](../m/market_value.md) of a company's assets. This reserve is part of shareholders' [equity](../e/equity.md) and is typically shown in the [equity](../e/equity.md) section of the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md).

## What is Revaluation Reserve?
[Revaluation](../r/revaluation.md) reserve is an account within the [equity](../e/equity.md) section of a company's [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md). It is used when a company revalues its fixed assets to reflect their current [market value](../m/market_value.md) rather than their [historical cost](../h/historical_cost.md). When the [value](../v/value.md) of these assets increases as a result of the [revaluation](../r/revaluation.md), the difference is credited to the [revaluation](../r/revaluation.md) reserve. Conversely, if the [value](../v/value.md) of the assets decreases, the loss would either reduce the [credit](../c/credit.md) in the [revaluation](../r/revaluation.md) reserve or be charged to the [profit](../p/profit.md) and loss account if there is no [credit](../c/credit.md) balance in the [revaluation](../r/revaluation.md) reserve. This [accounting method](../a/accounting_method.md) helps ensure that the company's [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) presents a more accurate reflection of its financial position.

## Purpose of Revaluation Reserve
The primary purposes of maintaining a [revaluation](../r/revaluation.md) reserve include:

1. **Reflecting True [Asset](../a/asset.md) [Value](../v/value.md)**: To present a more accurate picture of a company's [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) by reflecting the true [market value](../m/market_value.md) of its fixed assets.
2. **Compliance with [Accounting](../a/accounting.md) Standards**: [Accounting](../a/accounting.md) standards such as International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Generally Accepted [Accounting Principles](../a/accounting_principles.md) (GAAP) often require [revaluation](../r/revaluation.md) of assets.
3. **Enhanced Borrowing Capacity**: Demonstrating higher [asset](../a/asset.md) values can improve a company’s borrowing capacity by increasing its net [asset](../a/asset.md) base, which might be appreciated by lenders and investors.
4. **Preparation for [Sale](../s/sale.md)**: Companies planning on selling assets may revalue them to ensure they bring in a fair [market price](../m/market_price.md).

## Accounting Treatment
The [revaluation](../r/revaluation.md) process involves several important steps and considerations:

1. **Selection of Assets for [Revaluation](../r/revaluation.md)**: Not all assets need to be revalued. Companies often choose to revalue property, plant, and equipment, or other significant [long-term assets](../l/long-term_assets.md).
2. **[Valuation](../v/valuation.md) Method**: An independent valuer or an internal team typically conducts the [revaluation](../r/revaluation.md). Methods used might include [Market Value](../m/market_value.md), [Replacement Cost](../r/replacement_cost.md), or [Income Approach](../i/income_approach.md).
3. **[Journal](../j/journal.md) Entries**: Recording [revaluation](../r/revaluation.md) involves specific [journal](../j/journal.md) entries:
    - **Increase in [Value](../v/value.md)**: 
    ```markdown
    [Asset](../a/asset.md) Account                 Dr.
    [Revaluation](../r/revaluation.md) Reserve             Cr.
    ```
    - **Decrease in [Value](../v/value.md)**:
    ```markdown
    [Revaluation](../r/revaluation.md) Reserve           Dr. (if there is a [credit](../c/credit.md) balance)
    [Profit](../p/profit.md) and Loss Account       Dr. (if there is no [credit](../c/credit.md) balance)
    [Asset](../a/asset.md) Account                     Cr.
    ```
4. **[Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) Adjustment**: When assets are revalued, future [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) charges should be based on the revalued amount instead of the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s [original cost](../o/original_cost.md).

## Reporting and Disclosure
Companies are required to disclose details around the [revaluation](../r/revaluation.md) reserve in their [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md). These disclosures often include:

1. **[Revaluation](../r/revaluation.md) [Surplus](../s/surplus.md)**: The amount of increase in revaluations, which is recognized in the [revaluation](../r/revaluation.md) reserve.
2. **[Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) on Revalued [Asset](../a/asset.md)**: Adjustments in [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) charges due to [revaluation](../r/revaluation.md).
3. **[Impairment](../i/impairment.md)**: Any [impairment](../i/impairment.md) losses that are charged to the [revaluation](../r/revaluation.md) reserve.
4. **Movements in Reserve**: Detailed [reconciliation](../r/reconciliation.md) showing movements in the [revaluation](../r/revaluation.md) reserve during the reporting period.

## Examples of Usage

### Real Estate Companies
[Real estate](../r/real_estate.md) companies frequently use [revaluation](../r/revaluation.md) reserves because property values often fluctuate significantly. By revaluating their properties, these companies can show a more accurate reflection of their [asset](../a/asset.md) values. For instance, Segro, a [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) investment [trust](../t/trust.md), has used [revaluation](../r/revaluation.md) reserves in their financial reporting:
- [Segro's Financial Statements](https://www.segro.com/investors/reports/financial-reports)

### Manufacturing Companies
[Manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) companies with significant investments in plant and equipment also use [revaluation](../r/revaluation.md) reserves. For instance, Unilever has detailed disclosures on [revaluation](../r/revaluation.md) reserves:
- [Unilever's Annual Report](https://www.unilever.com/investors/annual-report-and-accounts/)

## Pros and Cons

### Advantages
- **True Reflection of [Asset](../a/asset.md) [Value](../v/value.md)**: Provides a more accurate [valuation](../v/valuation.md) of the company’s assets.
- **Increased [Equity](../e/equity.md)**: Enhances the company’s [equity](../e/equity.md) by reflecting increased [asset](../a/asset.md) values.
- **Better [Financial Ratios](../f/financial_ratios.md)**: Can positively impact [financial ratios](../f/financial_ratios.md), making the company appear more financially healthy.
- **Compliance**: Ensures compliance with [accounting](../a/accounting.md) standards.

### Disadvantages
- **[Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: [Asset](../a/asset.md) values can fluctuate widely which can introduce [volatility](../v/volatility.md) in the [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md).
- **Complexity and Cost**: The [revaluation](../r/revaluation.md) process can be complex and costly, necessitating expert valuations.
- **[Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) Complications**: Future [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) must be calculated on the revalued amounts, adding complexity to [accounting](../a/accounting.md) processes.
- **Potential for Misleading Information**: Overvaluation to improve appearance of [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) can mislead stakeholders.

## Regulatory Framework

### International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
According to IFRS, particularly IAS 16, companies have the option to revalue their property, plant, and equipment. The revalued amount should be its [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) at the date of the [revaluation](../r/revaluation.md), less any subsequent [accumulated depreciation](../a/accumulated_depreciation.md) and [impairment](../i/impairment.md) losses.

### Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)
In the United States, GAAP does not generally permit [revaluation](../r/revaluation.md) of fixed assets to their [fair value](../f/fair_value.md), emphasizing [historical cost](../h/historical_cost.md). However, some exceptions exist, especially for industries where [asset](../a/asset.md) [revaluation](../r/revaluation.md) is more common, such as utilities and [real estate](../r/real_estate.md).

### Local Regulations
Individual countries might have localized versions of these overarching principles, affecting how [revaluation](../r/revaluation.md) reserves are treated. For example, in the UK, the Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 102 provides [guidance](../g/guidance.md) on [asset](../a/asset.md) [revaluation](../r/revaluation.md) practices.

## Conclusion
[Revaluation](../r/revaluation.md) reserves [offer](../o/offer.md) a mechanism for companies to account for changes in the [market value](../m/market_value.md) of their assets, reflecting more accurately their financial position. While [offering](../o/offering.md) several benefits like enhanced [equity](../e/equity.md) and improved borrowing capacity, it also introduces complexities and potential pitfalls. Proper [accounting](../a/accounting.md), regular valuations, and transparent disclosures can help in managing these revaluations effectively. As always, adherence to relevant [accounting](../a/accounting.md) standards and local regulations is crucial to maintain the integrity and reliability of financial reporting.

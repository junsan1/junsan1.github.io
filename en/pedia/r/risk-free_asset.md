# Risk-Free Asset

In [finance](../f/finance.md), a [risk](../r/risk.md)-free [asset](../a/asset.md) is a theoretical investment that provides a certain [return](../r/return.md) with no [risk](../r/risk.md) of financial loss. It is an idealized investment tool, often used in financial theories and models to provide a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for evaluating other types of investments. The concept of a [risk](../r/risk.md)-free [asset](../a/asset.md) serves as the cornerstone for various fundamental theories, including the [Capital Asset](../c/capital_asset.md) Pricing Model (CAPM) and the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT).

## Key Characteristics

### Zero Default Risk
A [risk](../r/risk.md)-free [asset](../a/asset.md) has zero probability of [default](../d/default.md). Investors can be confident that they [will](../w/will.md) receive the promised cash flows on time and in full.

### Fixed Returns
The returns on a [risk](../r/risk.md)-free [asset](../a/asset.md) are predetermined and fixed over time. Investors know exactly what they [will](../w/will.md) earn without any [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md).

### Liquidity
[Risk](../r/risk.md)-free assets are highly [liquid](../l/liquid.md), meaning they can be easily bought or sold in the [market](../m/market.md) without significant price changes. This feature ensures that investors can convert them into cash without any loss in [value](../v/value.md).

## Examples of Risk-Free Assets

In reality, no investment can be said to be completely [risk](../r/risk.md)-free. However, certain types of assets are commonly considered to approximate the concept of a [risk](../r/risk.md)-free [asset](../a/asset.md):

### U.S. Treasury Securities
[U.S. Treasury](../u/u.s._treasury.md) Bills (T-bills), Notes, and Bonds are often considered the closest real-world equivalents to [risk](../r/risk.md)-free assets. They are backed by the full faith and [credit](../c/credit.md) of the U.S. government, making them extremely low-[risk](../r/risk.md). 

### Government Bonds from Stable Economies
Bonds issued by governments of stable and developed economies, like Germany or Japan, are also often considered as [risk](../r/risk.md)-free, although they might carry slightly more [risk](../r/risk.md) compared to U.S. Treasuries.

### Bank Certificates of Deposit (CDs)
In some cases, short-term [bank](../b/bank.md) certificates of [deposit](../d/deposit.md) (CDs) insured by a national [insurance](../i/insurance.md) organization (like the FDIC in the United States) are treated as [risk](../r/risk.md)-free assets. The [insurance](../i/insurance.md) guarantee protects the [principal](../p/principal.md) invested up to a certain amount.

## Applications in Financial Models

### Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
The CAPM uses the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate as a key input to determine the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) of an [asset](../a/asset.md). The formula is given by:

```
[Expected Return](../e/expected_return.md) = [Risk](../r/risk.md)-Free Rate + [Beta](../b/beta.md) * ([Market](../m/market.md) [Return](../r/return.md) - [Risk](../r/risk.md)-Free Rate)
```

Here, the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate serves as the [baseline](../b/baseline.md) [return](../r/return.md) that investors require for taking on zero [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)
MPT uses the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate to help investors construct an optimal portfolio that achieves the highest possible [return](../r/return.md) for a given level of [risk](../r/risk.md). By introducing a [risk](../r/risk.md)-free [asset](../a/asset.md) into the portfolio, investors can achieve combinations of [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md) that lie on the [efficient frontier](../e/efficient_frontier.md).

### Sharpe Ratio
The [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) measures the [excess return](../e/excess_return.md) per unit of [risk](../r/risk.md) in an investment or a portfolio:

```
[Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) = (Portfolio [Return](../r/return.md) - [Risk](../r/risk.md)-Free Rate) / [Standard Deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) of Portfolio Returns
```

The [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate here is used as a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) to assess whether the additional [risk](../r/risk.md) taken by [investing](../i/investing.md) in a risky [asset](../a/asset.md) is being adequately compensated.

## Limitations and Criticisms

Despite its theoretical appeal, the concept of a [risk](../r/risk.md)-free [asset](../a/asset.md) has limitations:

### Inflation Risk
Even government securities can be vulnerable to [inflation](../i/inflation.md), which erodes their real [value](../v/value.md) over time. 

### Reinvestment Risk
[Risk](../r/risk.md)-free assets that pay periodic [interest](../i/interest.md) or mature cannot guarantee the same returns upon [reinvestment](../r/reinvestment.md). This is particularly relevant in a fluctuating [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) environment.

### Long-term Risk
In the very long term, virtually all assets carry some [risk](../r/risk.md). Governments can [default](../d/default.md), currencies can depreciate, and political instability can affect even the most stable economies.

## Conclusion

The concept of a [risk](../r/risk.md)-free [asset](../a/asset.md) is an invaluable tool in financial theory and practice, providing a [baseline](../b/baseline.md) against which other investments can be evaluated. While no investment is truly without [risk](../r/risk.md), U.S. Treasuries and other stable government bonds often serve as close approximations. Understanding the role and limitations of [risk](../r/risk.md)-free assets helps investors make more informed decisions about [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md) in their portfolios.

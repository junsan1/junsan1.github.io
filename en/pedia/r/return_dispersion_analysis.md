# Return Dispersion Analysis

[Return](../r/return.md) [Dispersion](../d/dispersion.md) Analysis is a financial metric that measures the spread or deviation of individual [asset](../a/asset.md) returns within a portfolio. It is a critical concept in [financial modeling](../f/financial_modeling.md) and [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), [offering](../o/offering.md) insights into the performance dynamics of a portfolio. Essentially, [return](../r/return.md) [dispersion](../d/dispersion.md) reflects the degree to which individual returns deviate from the [average return](../a/average_return.md).

## Key Concepts

### 1. Definition
[Return](../r/return.md) [dispersion](../d/dispersion.md) is quantified as the [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) or variance of individual [asset](../a/asset.md) returns around the portfolio's mean [return](../r/return.md). It is a measure of [volatility](../v/volatility.md) within the portfolio.

### 2. Calculation
[Return](../r/return.md) [Dispersion](../d/dispersion.md) is typically calculated via the following steps:
1. **Identify the Returns:**
   Identify the individual returns of each [asset](../a/asset.md) within the portfolio over a given time period.
2. **Calculate Mean [Return](../r/return.md):**
   Compute the [average return](../a/average_return.md) of the portfolio.
   \[
   \text{Mean [Return](../r/return.md)} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} R_i
   \]
   where \( R_i \) is the [return](../r/return.md) of [asset](../a/asset.md) \( i \) and \( N \) is the total number of assets.
3. **Deviation from Mean:**
   Determine the deviation of each [asset](../a/asset.md)'s [return](../r/return.md) from the mean [return](../r/return.md).
4. **Variance Calculation:**
   Calculate the variance of these deviations.
   \[
   \text{Variance} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} (R_i - \text{Mean [Return](../r/return.md)})^2
   \]
5. **[Standard Deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md):**
   The square root of the variance gives the [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) (which is often referred to as [return](../r/return.md) [dispersion](../d/dispersion.md)).
   \[
   \text{[Return](../r/return.md) [Dispersion](../d/dispersion.md)} = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (R_i - \text{Mean [Return](../r/return.md)})^2 }
   \]

### 3. Importance in Portfolio Management
[Return](../r/return.md) [dispersion](../d/dispersion.md) analysis plays a critical role in understanding the [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md) characteristics of a portfolio. High [dispersion](../d/dispersion.md) implies greater [variability](../v/variability.md) among individual [asset](../a/asset.md) returns, indicating higher potential [risk](../r/risk.md).

### 4. Applications in Algorithmic Trading
- **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md):** [Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) systems use [return](../r/return.md) [dispersion](../d/dispersion.md) to gauge the riskiness of portfolios and adjust positions to maintain desired [risk](../r/risk.md) levels.
- **[Performance Benchmarking](../p/performance_benchmarking.md):** [Dispersion](../d/dispersion.md) analysis helps in benchmarking performance against an [index](../i/index.md) or another portfolio.
- **[Portfolio Optimization](../p/portfolio_optimization.md):** Algorithms can optimize portfolio allocations by minimizing [return](../r/return.md) [dispersion](../d/dispersion.md) to achieve a more stable [return](../r/return.md) profile.

## Practical Example
Consider a portfolio with three assets having returns of 10%, 5%, and 15%. The steps for calculating [return](../r/return.md) [dispersion](../d/dispersion.md) would be as follows:

1. **Mean [Return](../r/return.md):**
   \[
   \text{Mean [Return](../r/return.md)} = \frac{10 + 5 + 15}{3} = 10\%
   \]
2. **Deviations from Mean:**
   \[
   10\% - 10\% = 0\%
   \]
   \[
   5\% - 10\% = -5\%
   \]
   \[
   15\% - 10\% = 5\%
   \]
3. **Variance:**
   \[
   \text{Variance} = \frac{1}{3} [(0\%)^2 + (-5\%)^2 + (5\%)^2] = \frac{1}{3} [0 + 25 + 25] = \frac{50}{3} = \approx 16.67
   \]
4. **[Return](../r/return.md) [Dispersion](../d/dispersion.md):**
   \[
   \text{[Standard Deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md)} = \sqrt{16.67} \approx 4.08\%
   \]

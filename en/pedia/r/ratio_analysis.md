# Ratio Analysis

Ratio analysis is a quantitative method of analyzing financial statements to evaluate a company's performance, stability, and profitability by comparing different line items in the financial reports. These ratios help in understanding the company's operational efficiency, liquidity, profitability, and solvency. This method is essential for stakeholders, including investors, creditors, and management, as it provides insights into the financial health and prospects of an organization.

## Types of Ratios

### Liquidity Ratios

Liquidity ratios measure a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations. They indicate the ease with which a company can convert its assets into cash without impacting its operational capability.

1. **Current Ratio**
    \[
    \text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}
    \]
    A ratio higher than 1 signifies that the company has more current assets than current liabilities, suggesting good short-term financial health.

2. **Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)**
    \[
    \text{Quick Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets} - \text{Inventory}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}
    \]
    This ratio is a more stringent test of liquidity as it excludes inventory, which may not be as easily converted to cash.

3. **Cash Ratio**
    \[
    \text{Cash Ratio} = \frac{\text{Cash and Cash Equivalents}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}
    \]
    This ratio focuses solely on the most liquid assets, ensuring the company's ability to pay off short-term liabilities immediately.

### Profitability Ratios

Profitability ratios evaluate a company's ability to generate earnings relative to sales, assets, equity, and other metrics. These ratios are crucial for assessing the company's financial health over the long term.

1. **Gross Profit Margin**
    \[
    \text{Gross Profit Margin} = \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Revenue}} \times 100
    \]
    This ratio shows the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS), indicating the efficiency of production.

2. **Operating Profit Margin**
    \[
    \text{Operating Profit Margin} = \frac{\text{Operating Income}}{\text{Revenue}} \times 100
    \]
    This measures the proportion of revenue that remains after covering operating expenses, revealing the core operational efficiency.

3. **Net Profit Margin**
    \[
    \text{Net Profit Margin} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Revenue}} \times 100
    \]
    This ratio indicates the percentage of revenue remaining after all expenses, taxes, and costs have been deducted, reflecting overall profitability.

4. **Return on Assets (ROA)**
    \[
    \text{ROA} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Total Assets}} \times 100
    \]
    ROA measures how effectively a company uses its assets to generate profit.

5. **Return on Equity (ROE)**
    \[
    \text{ROE} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Shareholder's Equity}} \times 100
    \]
    ROE indicates the return generated on shareholders' investments, showcasing financial performance from the shareholders' perspective.

### Leverage Ratios

Leverage ratios assess the degree to which a company is utilizing borrowed money. They help understand the financial structure and risk levels associated with the company's capital.

1. **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**
    \[
    \text{Debt-to-Equity Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Debt}}{\text{Total Equity}}
    \]
    This ratio reveals the proportion of company financing coming from creditors versus shareholders, indicating financial leverage.

2. **Debt Ratio**
    \[
    \text{Debt Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Debt}}{\text{Total Assets}}
    \]
    This measures the percentage of a company's assets that are financed by debt and indicates the reliance on borrowing for asset purchases.

3. **Interest Coverage Ratio**
    \[
    \text{Interest Coverage Ratio} = \frac{\text{Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT)}}{\text{Interest Expense}}
    \]
    This ratio determines how easily a company can pay interest on outstanding debt from its operational income.

### Efficiency Ratios

Efficiency ratios, also known as activity ratios, measure how well a company utilizes its assets and manages its operations. These ratios help in assessing operational efficiency and management effectiveness.

1. **Asset Turnover Ratio**
    \[
    \text{Asset Turnover Ratio} = \frac{\text{Revenue}}{\text{Total Assets}}
    \]
    This ratio evaluates how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales.

2. **Inventory Turnover Ratio**
    \[
    \text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \frac{\text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}}{\text{Average Inventory}}
    \]
    This measures how many times a company’s inventory is sold and replaced over a period.

3. **Receivables Turnover Ratio**
    \[
    \text{Receivables Turnover Ratio} = \frac{\text{Revenue}}{\text{Average Accounts Receivable}}
    \]
    This ratio evaluates how effectively the company collects receivables from customers.

4. **Payables Turnover Ratio**
    \[
    \text{Payables Turnover Ratio} = \frac{\text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}}{\text{Average Accounts Payable}}
    \]
    This indicates how quickly a company pays off its suppliers.

### Market Valuation Ratios

Market valuation ratios provide insights into the market perception of a company's equity, assessing how well the stock is performing and valuing its profitability and growth potential.

1. **Price-Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio)**
    \[
    \text{P/E Ratio} = \frac{\text{Market Price per Share}}{\text{Earnings per Share (EPS)}}
    \]
    This ratio indicates how much investors are willing to pay per dollar of earnings, reflecting market expectations about the company's growth prospects.

2. **Price-to-Book Ratio (P/B Ratio)**
    \[
    \text{P/B Ratio} = \frac{\text{Market Price per Share}}{\text{Book Value per Share}}
    \]
    This measures the market valuation of a company relative to its book value.

3. **Dividend Yield**
    \[
    \text{Dividend Yield} = \frac{\text{Annual Dividends per Share}}{\text{Market Price per Share}} \times 100
    \]
    This ratio shows the annual dividends received as a percentage of the stock price, indicating income generation for shareholders.

4. **Earnings Yield**
    \[
    \text{Earnings Yield} = \frac{\text{Earnings per Share (EPS)}}{\text{Market Price per Share}} \times 100
    \]
    This reflects the percentage of each dollar invested in the stock that was earned by the company.

### External Analysts

Financial analysts use ratio analysis for valuations, forecasting, and recommendations. They employ various models that incorporate these ratios to predict future performance and market valuations.

## Limitations of Ratio Analysis

While ratio analysis provides critical insights, it has several limitations that must be considered:

1. **Historical Data Dependence**: Ratios are based on historical data, which may not accurately predict future performance.

2. **Comparability Issues**: Differences in accounting policies and business models can make comparisons difficult across companies or industries.

3. **Non-Financial Factors**: Ratios do not account for qualitative factors such as market conditions, management effectiveness, or brand strength.

4. **Static Analysis**: Ratios provide a snapshot of a company’s financial status at a specific point in time and may not reflect real-time conditions.

5. **Window Dressing**: Companies may sometimes manipulate financial statements to present a more favorable picture through accounting techniques.

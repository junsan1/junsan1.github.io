# Regulation CC

Regulation CC (Reg CC) is a United States federal regulation that implements the Expedited Funds Availability Act of 1987 (EFAA). This regulation is intended to standardize the procedures and timeframes banks and other financial institutions must follow when processing deposits, specifically checks, and making funds available to customers. Reg CC is crucial for consumer protections, financial [transparency](../t/transparency.md), and maintaining the integrity of the banking system. Here, we’ll explore its definition, purpose, and functionality in detail.

## Definition
Regulation CC is codified under Title 12, Part 229 of the Code of Federal Regulations. It is designed to:
1. Outline the time frames within which financial institutions must make deposited funds available to customers.
2. Establish standards for the collection and [return](../r/return.md) of checks to facilitate efficient [clearing and settlement](../c/clearing_and_settlement.md).
3. Mandate certain disclosures to consumers regarding their rights and financial institution policies.

## Purpose
The main objectives of Regulation CC are:
1. **Promote [Efficiency](../e/efficiency.md)**: By providing uniform rules for the timing of funds availability and [check](../c/check.md) clearance, Reg CC ensures an efficient and predictable [payment](../p/payment.md) system.
2. **Enhance Consumer Protections**: Consumers are protected through clear guidelines on when they can access their funds, reducing instances of [fraud](../f/fraud.md) and ensuring fair treatment.
3. **Encourage [Transparency](../t/transparency.md)**: It requires financial institutions to disclose their funds availability policies, giving consumers more information on when they can expect to have access to their funds.

## How It Works
### Funds Availability
Regulation CC specifies the maximum timeframes for the availability of different types of deposits:
1. **Next-Day Availability**: For certain types of deposits, such as cash, electronic payments, and the first $225 of a day’s total deposits of local checks, funds must be made available by the next [business](../b/business.md) day.
2. **Two-Day Availability**: Government checks, cashier’s checks, certified checks, teller’s checks, and certain other types of checks must clear within two [business](../b/business.md) days.
3. **Five-Day Availability**: Most other checks might be subject to a [hold](../h/hold.md) of up to five [business](../b/business.md) days for local items or even longer under certain circumstances.

### Exceptions to Standard Holds
Reg CC provides financial institutions with the authority to extend the [hold](../h/hold.md) period under specific conditions:
1. **New Accounts**: Checks deposited within the first 30 days after an account is opened may be subject to longer [hold](../h/hold.md) times.
2. **Large Deposits**: Deposits over $5,525 on any single day can be partially held for a longer [duration](../d/duration.md).
3. **Redeposited Checks**: Checks that have been returned unpaid and then redeposited can be held for additional time.
4. **Repeatedly Overdrawn Accounts**: Accounts that have been overdrawn [multiple](../m/multiple.md) times within the past six months might face extended [hold](../h/hold.md) times.
5. **Reasonable Doubt of Collectibility**: If a [bank](../b/bank.md) has reasonable cause to believe a [check](../c/check.md) [will](../w/will.md) not be paid, it can extend the [hold](../h/hold.md) period.

### Check Collection and Return Standards
Reg CC also sets rules to ensure the swift and orderly collection and [return](../r/return.md) of checks:
1. **[Endorsement](../e/endorsement.md) Standards**: The regulation specifies where endorsements should be placed on checks to prevent delays and errors in processing.
2. **[Return](../r/return.md) Deadlines**: Banks must [return](../r/return.md) unpaid checks to the [depository](../d/depository.md) [bank](../b/bank.md) by the next [business](../b/business.md) day following the day of the determination of nonpayment.
3. **Notification of Nonpayment**: For certain large checks, banks must provide electronic or written notification of nonpayment to the [depository](../d/depository.md) [bank](../b/bank.md) within a specified time.

### Disclosure Requirements
Financial institutions must disclose their funds availability policies to customers in a clear and conspicuous manner:
1. **Initial Disclosures**: When a [customer](../c/customer.md) opens a new account, the [bank](../b/bank.md) must provide a notice detailing the [bank](../b/bank.md)’s funds availability policy.
2. **Change in Policy**: Customers must be notified of any changes to the funds availability policy at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect.
3. **At Point of [Deposit](../d/deposit.md)**: Banks must provide a notice at the time of [deposit](../d/deposit.md) if funds from the [deposit](../d/deposit.md) [will](../w/will.md) be delayed beyond the standard availability time.

### Electronification of Check Processing
Amendments to Regulation CC have incorporated the increasing electronification of [check](../c/check.md) processing, such as remote [deposit](../d/deposit.md) capture and the [Check](../c/check.md) [Clearing](../c/clearing.md) for the 21st Century Act ([Check](../c/check.md) 21):
1. **[Electronic Check](../e/electronic_check.md) Presentment**: Guidelines for the electronic [exchange](../e/exchange.md) of [check](../c/check.md) images and data to facilitate quicker [clearing](../c/clearing.md) times.
2. **[Substitute](../s/substitute.md) Checks**: Allows the use of [substitute](../s/substitute.md) checks (i.e., digital copies of original checks) that are the legal equivalent of the original paper checks.

## Conclusion
Regulation CC plays a vital role in the U.S. banking system by creating standardized procedures for funds availability and [check](../c/check.md) processing. It ensures [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md), [transparency](../t/transparency.md), and consumer protection by defining clear rules for financial institutions to follow. By understanding the intricacies of Reg CC, both consumers and financial institutions can better navigate the complexities of the banking system and enhance mutual [trust](../t/trust.md) in financial transactions.

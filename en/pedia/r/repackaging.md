# Repackaging

Repackaging in the financial context refers to the process of taking existing financial products or instruments and [restructuring](../r/restructuring.md) them into new products. This is a common practice in the world of [structured finance](../s/structured_finance.md), where complex securities are created by combining or altering the characteristics of simpler financial assets. The goal of repackaging is often to manage [risk](../r/risk.md), enhance [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), meet specific investment criteria, or take advantage of [market](../m/market.md) inefficiencies. Repackaging is crucial in the development of structured products, synthetic assets, and [asset](../a/asset.md)-backed securities. 

## Types of Repackaging

### 1. Securitization
[Securitization](../s/securitization.md) is a financial process that involves pooling various types of contractual [debt](../d/debt.md) such as mortgages, auto loans, or [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) [debt](../d/debt.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md) and selling their related cash flows to third-party investors as securities. These securities are often structured into [tranches](../t/tranches.md) with varying levels of [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md). 

### 2. Synthetic Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs)
Synthetic CDOs are a type of [structured finance](../s/structured_finance.md) product that uses [credit default swaps](../c/credit_default_swaps.md) (CDS) to [gain](../g/gain.md) exposure to a portfolio of [fixed income](../f/fixed_income.md) assets. Instead of holding actual assets like bonds or loans, synthetic CDOs are constructed using CDS to simulate the [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) of these assets. Investors in synthetic CDOs receive payments based on the performance of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [credit default swaps](../c/credit_default_swaps.md).

### 3. Exchange-Traded Notes (ETNs)
ETNs are [debt](../d/debt.md) securities issued by financial institutions that provide returns based on the performance of a [market index](../m/market_index.md) or other [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md), minus fees. ETNs are designed to [offer](../o/offer.md) investors easy access to investment strategies that might be difficult or expensive to implement directly. They are often used to [gain](../g/gain.md) exposure to markets such as commodities, emerging markets, or specific investment themes.

### 4. Structured Notes
Structured notes are [debt](../d/debt.md) securities with returns linked to the performance of one or more assets, such as equities, commodities, currencies, or [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. These notes are typically customized to meet the specific requirements of investors, [offering](../o/offering.md) tailored [risk](../r/risk.md)/[return](../r/return.md) profiles and investment horizons. Structured notes often include embedded [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) to achieve their specific payoffs.

## Benefits of Repackaging 

### 1. Risk Management
By repackaging financial products, issuers can redistribute [risk](../r/risk.md) among different investors with varying [risk](../r/risk.md) appetites. For example, in [securitization](../s/securitization.md), senior [tranches](../t/tranches.md) might be less risky and suitable for conservative investors, while junior [tranches](../t/tranches.md) carry higher [risk](../r/risk.md) and potential [return](../r/return.md) for more aggressive investors.

### 2. Liquidity Enhancement
Repackaging existing assets into new products can improve their [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md). For example, mortgages might be relatively illiquid on their own, but when they are pooled and securitized, the resulting [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-backed securities can be more easily traded in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

### 3. Customization
Repackaging allows for the creation of tailored financial products that meet specific [investor](../i/investor.md) needs or objectives. This can include adjusting the [risk](../r/risk.md)/[return](../r/return.md) profile, [maturity](../m/maturity.md), or other features to match [investor](../i/investor.md) preferences.

### 4. Market Efficiency
Repackaging can help to take advantage of [market](../m/market.md) inefficiencies by creating products that better align with [investor](../i/investor.md) [demand](../d/demand.md). This process can also contribute to [price discovery](../p/price_discovery.md) and the efficient allocation of [capital](../c/capital.md) in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

## Risks of Repackaging

### 1. Complexity
Repackaged financial products can be highly complex, making it difficult for investors to fully understand the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) risks. This complexity can lead to mispricing, misallocation of [risk](../r/risk.md), and unexpected losses.

### 2. Systemic Risk
The creation and widespread [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of complex financial products can contribute to [systemic risk](../s/systemic_risk.md) in the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md). During the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) of 2007-2008, the collapse of [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-backed securities and related products played a significant role in the broader financial meltdown.

### 3. Counterparty Risk
Repackaged products often involve [multiple](../m/multiple.md) parties, including originators, issuers, and counterparties to [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) contracts. The failure of any one of these parties can lead to significant losses for investors holding repackaged products.

### 4. Regulatory Risk
Changes in regulations can impact the viability and attractiveness of repackaged financial products. For example, new rules on [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements or [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) can affect the issuance and trading of [structured finance](../s/structured_finance.md) products.

## Conclusion
Repackaging in [finance](../f/finance.md) is a critical process that allows for the creation of new, innovative financial products from existing assets. While it offers numerous benefits such as [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) enhancement, and customization, it also introduces significant risks, including complexity and [systemic risk](../s/systemic_risk.md). Understanding the intricacies of repackaging and carefully evaluating the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) components are essential for making informed investment decisions in this space.

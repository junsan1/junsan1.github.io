# Regulation SHO

Regulation SHO is a set of rules implemented by the U.S. Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) aimed at addressing concerns in the [short selling](../s/short_selling.md) of securities. These rules are designed to ensure that [market](../m/market.md) participants are in compliance with the legal and regulatory framework governing short sales and to enhance the [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and fairness of the securities [market](../m/market.md). Introduced in January 2005, Regulation SHO represents a comprehensive approach to regulating [short selling](../s/short_selling.md) practices and safeguarding [market](../m/market.md) stability. 

## What It Regulates

Regulation SHO aims to regulate several key aspects of [short selling](../s/short_selling.md), including:

### 1. **Locate Requirement**

Under Rule 203(b)(1) of Regulation SHO, [broker](../b/broker.md)-dealers are required to have reasonable grounds to believe that the [security](../s/security.md) can be borrowed so it can be delivered on the delivery date before accepting [short sale](../s/short_sale.md) orders from clients. This effectively eliminates the possibility of "naked" [short selling](../s/short_selling.md), wherein a [trader](../t/trader.md) sells a [security](../s/security.md) short without first ensuring that they can borrow it.

### 2. **Short Sale Restrictions**

Regulation SHO also establishes restrictions on short sales under conditions referred to as "close-out provisions." These provisions mandate that fails-to-deliver positions must be closed out by borrowing or purchasing securities of like kind and quantity. 

### 3. **Threshold Securities**

Threshold securities are securities that have an aggregate [fail](../f/fail.md) to deliver position for:

- Five consecutive settlement days at a [clearing](../c/clearing.md) agency registered with the SEC; 
- The fails to deliver position is equal to at least 10,000 [shares](../s/shares.md); 
- The position is equal to at least 0.5% of the [issuer](../i/issuer.md)’s total outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md).

[Broker](../b/broker.md)-dealers dealing with threshold securities face additional delivery requirements to rectify fails to deliver beyond the acceptable thresholds to prevent persistent failures.

### 4. **Market Maker Exception**

Rule 203(b)(2) does provide an exception for [market](../m/market.md) makers engaged in bona fide [market](../m/market.md) making in the [security](../s/security.md) for which they have failed delivery. This allows [market](../m/market.md) makers to contribute to [market](../m/market.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) without being unduly penalized by immediate settlement requirements.

## Requirements of Regulation SHO

### 1. **Marking Requirements**

Rule 200(g) of Regulation SHO requires [broker](../b/broker.md)-dealers to mark all sales of [equity](../e/equity.md) securities. These mark orders are designated as “long,” “short,” or “short exempt.” The "long" designation applies when the seller has explicitly confirmed ownership of the [security](../s/security.md), while "short" applies to [short sale](../s/short_sale.md) transactions. The term "short exempt" is used for transactions that are exempt from the [uptick rule](../u/uptick_rule.md) requirement under specific conditions.

### 2. **Transaction Reporting**

Regulation SHO mandates real-time reporting of [short interest](../s/short_interest.md) data. [Market](../m/market.md) centers such as exchanges and self-regulatory organizations (SROs) are required to publish data on [short sale](../s/short_sale.md) volumes and [market](../m/market.md) levels to provide [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and equal access to information for all investors.

### 3. **Regulatory Relief and Misinterpretations**

The SEC occasionally offers no-action letters or staff interpretations that can provide regulatory relief to [market](../m/market.md) participants. These clarifications assist brokers and traders in better understanding and complying with the complex rules governing short sales.

### 4. **Governance and Enforcement**

The SEC oversees compliance with Regulation SHO using examinations and enforcement actions. Violations of Regulation SHO, such as illegal naked [short selling](../s/short_selling.md) or persistent fails-to-deliver, can result in substantial fines, penalties, and other sanctions.

### 5. **Record-Keeping**

[Broker](../b/broker.md)-dealers must maintain comprehensive records of their [short sale](../s/short_sale.md) transactions. These records must be easily accessible for audit and regulatory review to ensure compliance with the locate and close-out requirements of Regulation SHO.

## Impact on Market Practices

### 1. **Reduced Volatility**

By enforcing stricter rules on [short selling](../s/short_selling.md), Regulation SHO aims to minimize [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and prevent manipulative practices like "bear raids," which can otherwise destabilize the [stock market](../s/stock_market.md).

### 2. **Enhanced Investor Confidence**

Regulation SHO, through its [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and regulatory oversight, bolsters [investor](../i/investor.md) confidence. Clear rules and increased scrutiny reduce the likelihood of [market](../m/market.md) abuses and foster a fair [trading environment](../t/trading_environment.md).

### 3. **Liquidity and Pricing Efficiency**

[Market](../m/market.md) makers, under certain exceptions within Regulation SHO, provide [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) which is essential for the proper functioning of the markets. Simultaneously, the locate and delivery requirements ensure that [short sale](../s/short_sale.md) transactions reflect genuine [market](../m/market.md) introspections rather than speculative [bubbles](../b/bubble.md).

### 4. **Impact on Short Selling Strategies**

[Hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds, institutional investors, and other [market](../m/market.md) participants must adapt their [short selling](../s/short_selling.md) strategies to comply with Regulation SHO. Compliance costs can increase, and strategies may require more sophisticated tools to track locate and delivery statuses.

## Ongoing Developments

Regulation SHO has undergone several modifications and interpretations since its introduction. Key amendments have been made to address emerging [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md), technological advancements, and feedback from [market](../m/market.md) participants.

- **Amendments and Updates:** The [Commission](../c/commission.md) regularly updates Regulation SHO to close loopholes, address changing [market](../m/market.md) structures, and respond to crises such as the 2008 financial downturn or Covid-19 [market](../m/market.md) pressures.
  
- **Technological Integration:** Enhanced [data analytics](../d/data_analytics.md), real-time auditing tools, and integration of [Artificial Intelligence](../a/artificial_intelligence_in_trading.md) (AI) for compliance purposes have evolved alongside Regulation SHO to make it more effective in a highly digital [trading environment](../t/trading_environment.md).

## Notable Cases and Precedents

Various high-profile securities cases have hinged on violations or adherence to Regulation SHO:

- **[Bear Stearns](../b/bear_stearns.md):** The SEC's examination of [Bear Stearns](../b/bear_stearns.md) revealed significant violations related to improper [short selling](../s/short_selling.md) which underscored the necessity for stringent compliance with Regulation SHO.
- **[Lehman Brothers](../l/lehman_brothers.md):** The [firm](../f/firm.md)'s collapse involved scrutiny of its [market](../m/market.md) practices, including [short selling](../s/short_selling.md) allegations that highlighted the critical role Regulation SHO plays in monitoring and controlling [market](../m/market.md) activities.

## Conclusion

Regulation SHO is a cornerstone of the SEC’s regulatory framework, ensuring that [short selling](../s/short_selling.md) is conducted responsibly and transparently within the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). By setting forth clear guidelines and strict requirements on short sales, the regulation contributes to [market](../m/market.md) stability, protects investors, and enhances the overall integrity of the U.S. securities [market](../m/market.md).

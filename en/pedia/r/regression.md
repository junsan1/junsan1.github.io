# Regression in Finance and Trading

[Regression analysis](../r/regression_analysis.md) is a statistical tool that explores the relationship between two or more variables. It is widely used in the fields of [finance](../f/finance.md) and trading to model and analyze the interconnections between different [asset](../a/asset.md) prices or [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md). Its primary goal is to understand how the dependent variable changes when any one of the independent variables is varied while the other independent variables are held fixed.

## Types of Regression

### 1. Simple Linear Regression

[Simple linear regression](../s/simple_linear_regression.md) involves a single predictor variable and is commonly used when there is a straight-line relationship between the independent variable \(X\) and the dependent variable \(Y\). The relationship can be described by:

\[ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \epsilon \]

Where:
  
- \(Y\) is the dependent variable.
- \(X\) is the independent variable.
- \(\beta_0\) is the y-intercept.
- \(\beta_1\) is the slope of the line.
- \(\epsilon\) is the random [error term](../e/error_term.md).

#### Example in Trading

Suppose you want to predict a stock's future prices based on its historical prices. Historical price is your independent variable \(X\), and future price is your dependent variable \(Y\).

```python
[import](../i/import.md) numpy as np
[import](../i/import.md) pandas as pd
[import](../i/import.md) statsmodels.api as sm

# Creating a dataframe with historical prices
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Historical_Price': [100, 101, 102, 103, 104],
    'Future_Price': [101, 102, 103, 104, 105]
})

# Fitting the model
X = data['Historical_Price']
y = data['Future_Price']
X = sm.add_constant(X)  # Adds a constant term to the predictor
model = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()

# Predictions
predictions = model.predict(X)
print(predictions)
```

### 2. Multiple Linear Regression

[Multiple linear regression](../m/multiple_linear_regression.md) involves two or more predictor variables. The relationship can be described by:

\[ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + \ldots + \beta_pX_p + \epsilon \]

Where:
  
- \(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_p\) are the predictor variables.

#### Example in Trading

Predicting a stock's future prices based on [multiple](../m/multiple.md) factors such as historical prices, [volume](../v/volume.md), and [market](../m/market.md) indices.

```python
# Creating dataframe with multiple factors
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Historical_Price': [100, 101, 102, 103, 104],
    '[Volume](../v/volume.md)': [2000, 2200, 2100, 2300, 2400],
    'Market_Index': [1500, 1520, 1510, 1530, 1540],
    'Future_Price': [101, 102, 103, 104, 105]
})

# Fitting the model
X = data[['Historical_Price', '[Volume](../v/volume.md)', 'Market_Index']]
y = data['Future_Price']
X = sm.add_constant(X)  # Adds a constant term to the predictor
model = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()

# Predictions
predictions = model.predict(X)
print(predictions)
```

### 3. Polynomial Regression

When the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable is not linear, polynomial regression can be used. The relationship can be described by:

\[ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \beta_2X^2 + \beta_3X^3 + \ldots + \beta_dX^d + \epsilon \]

Where:
  
- \(d\) is the degree of the polynomial.

#### Example in Trading

Predicting a stock's future prices where the price may have a quadratic or cubic relationship with the independent variables.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing [import](../i/import.md) PolynomialFeatures
from sklearn.linear_model [import](../i/import.md) LinearRegression

# Creating dataframe
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Historical_Price': [100, 101, 102, 103, 104],
    'Future_Price': [101, 102, 103, 104, 105]
})

# Prepare the polynomial features
poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2)
X_poly = poly.fit_transform(data[['Historical_Price']])

# Fitting the model
lin_reg = LinearRegression()
lin_reg.fit(X_poly, data['Future_Price'])

# Predictions
predictions = lin_reg.predict(X_poly)
print(predictions)
```

## Methods to Assess Model Accuracy

### 1. R-squared

[R-squared](../r/r-squared_in_trading.md) is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance for the dependent variable that's explained by the independent variable(s).

\[ R^2 = 1 - \frac{SS_{res}}{SS_{tot}} \]

Where:
  
- \(SS_{res}\) is the sum of the squares of the residuals.
- \(SS_{tot}\) is the total [sum of squares](../s/sum_of_squares.md).

### 2. Adjusted R-squared

Adjusted [R-squared](../r/r-squared_in_trading.md) adjusts the [R-squared](../r/r-squared_in_trading.md) [value](../v/value.md) based on the number of predictors in the model. It is useful when comparing models with different numbers of predictors.

\[ \text{Adjusted } R^2 = 1 - \frac{(1-R^2)(n-1)}{n-k-1} \]

Where:
  
- \(n\) is the number of observations.
- \(k\) is the number of predictors.

### 3. Mean Squared Error (MSE)

The [mean squared error](../m/mean_squared_error.md) is the average of the squares of the errors. The error is the amount by which the observed [value](../v/value.md) differs from the predicted [value](../v/value.md).

\[ MSE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y_i})^2 \]

Where:
  
- \(n\) is the number of observations.
- \(y_i\) is the observed [value](../v/value.md).
- \(\hat{y_i}\) is the predicted [value](../v/value.md).

## Regularization Techniques

### 1. Ridge Regression

Ridge regression uses L2 regularization to shrink the coefficients of the model, which helps to prevent [overfitting](../o/overfitting.md). The objective function is:

\[ \min_{\beta} \| y - X\beta \|^2_2 + \[lambda](../l/lambda.md) \| \[beta](../b/beta.md) \|^2_2 \]

Where:
  
- \(\[lambda](../l/lambda.md)\) is the regularization parameter.

### 2. Lasso Regression

Lasso regression uses L1 regularization to impose a constraint that some coefficients are exactly zero, thereby providing feature selection. The objective function is:

\[ \min_{\beta} \| y - X\beta \|^2_2 + \[lambda](../l/lambda.md) \| \[beta](../b/beta.md) \|_1 \]

### Example of Ridge and Lasso Regression

```python
from sklearn.linear_model [import](../i/import.md) Ridge, Lasso

# Generating dataset
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Historical_Price': [100, 101, 102, 103, 104],
    '[Volume](../v/volume.md)': [2000, 2200, 2100, 2300, 2400],
    'Market_Index': [1500, 1520, 1510, 1530, 1540],
    'Future_Price': [101, 102, 103, 104, 105]
})

# Ridge Regression
ridge = Ridge([alpha](../a/alpha.md)=1.0)
ridge.fit(data[['Historical_Price', '[Volume](../v/volume.md)', 'Market_Index']], data['Future_Price'])
ridge_predictions = ridge.predict(data[['Historical_Price', '[Volume](../v/volume.md)', 'Market_Index']])
print('Ridge Predictions:', ridge_predictions)

# Lasso Regression
lasso = Lasso([alpha](../a/alpha.md)=0.1)
lasso.fit(data[['Historical_Price', '[Volume](../v/volume.md)', 'Market_Index']], data['Future_Price'])
lasso_predictions = lasso.predict(data[['Historical_Price', '[Volume](../v/volume.md)', 'Market_Index']])
print('Lasso Predictions:', lasso_predictions)
```

## Applications of Regression in Finance

### 1. Risk Management

Regression is widely used in [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) to model the relationship between the returns of a portfolio and [market](../m/market.md) factors. For example, the [Capital Asset](../c/capital_asset.md) Pricing Model (CAPM) is a [linear regression](../l/linear_regression.md) model that describes the relationship between a stockâ€™s [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) and its [risk](../r/risk.md) compared to the [market](../m/market.md).

### 2. Valuation

In [valuation](../v/valuation.md), [regression analysis](../r/regression_analysis.md) can help to estimate the [value](../v/value.md) of a company by analyzing the relationships between the company's financial metrics (such as [earnings](../e/earnings.md), [revenue](../r/revenue.md), and [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md)) and its [market value](../m/market_value.md).

### 3. Algorithmic Trading

In [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), regression models are used to predict future price movements based on historical data. The coefficients of the regression model can help to identify how strongly various factors influence the [asset](../a/asset.md) price.

# Rehypothecation

Rehypothecation is a practice in the financial [industry](../i/industry.md) where banks and brokers use, for their own purposes, assets that have been posted as [collateral](../c/collateral.md) by their clients. When clients provide securities as [collateral](../c/collateral.md) to a [bank](../b/bank.md) or brokerage, the institution in question is typically granted the right to use those securities for its own investments and speculative activities. While this practice can facilitate [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), it also introduces a variety of risks that have been subjects of regulatory scrutiny and economic debate.

## Understanding Rehypothecation

### Basic Principles

In traditional [hypothecation](../h/hypothecation.md), borrowers [offer](../o/offer.md) [collateral](../c/collateral.md) to lenders to secure their borrowing. For example, an [investor](../i/investor.md) might post securities like [stocks](../s/stock.md) or bonds as [collateral](../c/collateral.md) in a [margin account](../m/margin_account.md) to borrow more funds for trading. In rehypothecation, the [lender](../l/lender.md)—usually a [broker](../b/broker.md) or [bank](../b/bank.md)—takes the posted [collateral](../c/collateral.md) and uses it for its own purposes, such as securing its own loans or for trading activities.

### Legal Framework

The rights and limitations surrounding rehypothecation are typically governed by legal agreements, specifically [customer](../c/customer.md) agreements and client contracts. Within these agreements, there are usually stipulations outlining the extent to which an institution can rehypothecate posted [collateral](../c/collateral.md). For example, in the United States, the Federal Reserve Regulation T limits the amount of rehypothecated [collateral](../c/collateral.md) to 140% of the [customer](../c/customer.md)'s [debit balance](../d/debit_balance.md).

### Operational Mechanics

1. **[Margin](../m/margin.md) Accounts**: Investors often [trade](../t/trade.md) on [margin](../m/margin.md), borrowing funds from brokers to increase their [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md). The securities bought on [margin](../m/margin.md), as well as those posted as initial [collateral](../c/collateral.md), can be rehypothecated by the [broker](../b/broker.md).

2. **[Securities Lending](../s/securities_lending.md)**: Brokers may lend out the rehypothecated securities to other institutions, who may use them for [short selling](../s/short_selling.md) or to meet other [collateral](../c/collateral.md) requirements.

3. **Repo Markets**: Rehypothecated securities are frequently used in repurchase agreements (repos), where the [bank](../b/bank.md) or [broker](../b/broker.md) sells securities with an agreement to buy them back at a later date, raising short-term funds in the process.

## Implications and Risks

### Benefits

1. **Increased [Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)**: By allowing financial institutions to use [collateral](../c/collateral.md) more efficiently, rehypothecation can increase [market](../m/market.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), making it easier and less costly to obtain funding.

2. **Enhanced [Efficiency](../e/efficiency.md)**: Financial institutions can operate more efficiently as they can [leverage](../l/leverage.md) available resources ([collateral](../c/collateral.md)) to support a larger [volume](../v/volume.md) of transactions.

3. **Lower Costs**: Institutions can potentially [offer](../o/offer.md) lower costs of borrowing to clients, as they can [offset](../o/offset.md) the cost through activities financed by rehypothecated [collateral](../c/collateral.md).

### Risks

1. **[Counterparty Risk](../c/counterparty_risk.md)**: If the institution using rehypothecated [collateral](../c/collateral.md) becomes insolvent, the original owner of the [collateral](../c/collateral.md) could face losses.

2. **[Systemic Risk](../s/systemic_risk.md)**: Widespread rehypothecation can exacerbate [systemic risk](../s/systemic_risk.md) in the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md). In times of [market](../m/market.md) stress, a chain reaction of [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) shortages can be triggered if [multiple](../m/multiple.md) institutions [fail](../f/fail.md) to [return](../r/return.md) [collateral](../c/collateral.md).

3. **Complexity and [Transparency](../t/transparency.md)**: The practice can obscure the true ownership of assets, making it harder to assess financial stability.

4. **Legal Risks**: Different jurisdictions have varying regulations on rehypothecation, which can complicate cross-border transactions and legal recourses in case of disputes.

## Regulatory Environment

In the aftermath of the 2007-2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md), regulators around the world have increased scrutiny on rehypothecation due to concerns about its role in creating [systemic risk](../s/systemic_risk.md). Key regulations include:

1. **Dodd-Frank Act (USA)**: Introduced more stringent reporting requirements and [transparency](../t/transparency.md) measures for rehypothecation practices.

2. **[Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md)**: Set higher [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements and [liquidity ratios](../l/liquidity_ratios.md) for banks, indirectly affecting how and when banks can use rehypothecated assets.

3. **European [Market](../m/market.md) [Infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) Regulation (EMIR)**: Imposed similar [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and reporting standards on European institutions.

## Case Studies

### Lehman Brothers

The collapse of [Lehman Brothers](../l/lehman_brothers.md) in 2008 highlighted the risks associated with rehypothecation. Lehman practiced extensive rehypothecation, and when it went bankrupt, it left many of its clients in a precarious position as their [collateral](../c/collateral.md) was entangled in the [firm](../f/firm.md)'s failed transactions.

### MF Global

Similarly, MF Global's downfall in 2011 showcased the dangers of aggressive rehypothecation practices. The [firm](../f/firm.md) used [customer](../c/customer.md) [collateral](../c/collateral.md) to [fund](../f/fund.md) its own bets on European sovereign [debt](../d/debt.md), which led to significant losses and the eventual collapse of the [firm](../f/firm.md).

## Conclusion

Rehypothecation remains a double-edged sword in the financial [industry](../i/industry.md). While it can provide significant [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and operational benefits, it also introduces substantial risks that need to be carefully managed. Ongoing regulatory efforts aim to mitigate these risks, but the debate surrounding the practice continues. Financial institutions and investors must both understand and navigate these complexities to make informed decisions regarding rehypothecated assets.

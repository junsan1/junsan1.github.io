# Risk Reversal

[Risk](../r/risk.md) [Reversal](../r/reversal.md) is a popular strategy in [finance](../f/finance.md) and trading, particularly in the world of [options](../o/options.md) trading. It is also known as a "combo" strategy, where an [investor](../i/investor.md) buys a [call option](../c/call_option.md) and sells a [put option](../p/put.md) with the same [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md) and [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). This strategy is commonly used by traders to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) existing positions and as a speculative tool to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on expected movements of the [underlying security](../u/underlying_security.md). Below is a comprehensive exploration of the [risk](../r/risk.md) [reversal](../r/reversal.md) strategy and its applications in [finance](../f/finance.md).

## Understanding Risk Reversal

### Basic Components

1. **[Call Option](../c/call_option.md)**: A financial contract that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy a specified quantity of an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at a predetermined price ([strike price](../s/strike_price.md)) within a specified timeframe.
2. **[Put Option](../p/put.md)**: A financial contract that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell a specified quantity of an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at a predetermined price ([strike price](../s/strike_price.md)) within a specified timeframe.
3. **[Underlying Asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)**: The [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) (e.g., stock, [commodity](../c/commodity.md), [index](../i/index.md)) on which the [options](../o/options.md) are based.

In a [risk](../r/risk.md) [reversal](../r/reversal.md) strategy, the [options](../o/options.md) involved generally have the same [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md), and the objective is to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) or speculate on the price movement of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

### How It Works

[Risk](../r/risk.md) [reversal](../r/reversal.md) can be thought of as a synthetic long position, achieved using [options](../o/options.md):

1. **Long Call**: By purchasing a [call option](../c/call_option.md), the [trader](../t/trader.md) expects the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) to rise above the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md), allowing them to buy the [asset](../a/asset.md) at a [discount](../d/discount.md).
2. **[Short Put](../s/short_put.md)**: By selling a [put option](../p/put.md), the [trader](../t/trader.md) accepts the obligation to buy the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) if the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s price falls below the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md). This generates a [premium](../p/premium.md) for the [trader](../t/trader.md) but requires them to buy the [asset](../a/asset.md) if the [market](../m/market.md) declines.

### Example Scenario

Consider a [trader](../t/trader.md) who believes that the stock of XYZ [Corporation](../c/corporation.md), currently trading at $50, [will](../w/will.md) increase in price. The [trader](../t/trader.md) constructs a [risk](../r/risk.md) [reversal](../r/reversal.md) strategy:

- Buys a $55 [call option](../c/call_option.md) for $2.00
- Sells a $45 [put option](../p/put.md) for $2.00

The net cost of entering this position is zero as the premiums [offset](../o/offset.md) each other. If XYZ's stock price rises to $60, the [call option](../c/call_option.md) becomes profitable, and the [trader](../t/trader.md) benefits from the upward movement. If the stock price falls to $40, the [trader](../t/trader.md) is obligated to buy the stock at $45 but keeps the $2.00 [premium](../p/premium.md) received from selling the [put option](../p/put.md).

## Applications of Risk Reversal

### Hedging

[Risk](../r/risk.md) [reversal](../r/reversal.md) can be used to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) an existing long position on the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). For instance, an [investor](../i/investor.md) who owns the stock of a company might use [risk](../r/risk.md) [reversal](../r/reversal.md) to protect against [downside risk](../d/downside_risk.md) while retaining [upside potential](../u/upside_potential_in_trading.md).

### Speculation

Traders can use a [risk](../r/risk.md) [reversal](../r/reversal.md) strategy to speculate on large moves in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price without committing significant [capital](../c/capital.md) upfront. This synthetic position can be seen as a cost-effective way to [gain](../g/gain.md) exposure to price movements in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

### Income Generation

Since the [sale](../s/sale.md) of the [put option](../p/put.md) generates a [premium](../p/premium.md), [risk](../r/risk.md) [reversal](../r/reversal.md) can be used to generate [income](../i/income.md) in [neutral](../n/neutral.md) to moderately bullish [market](../m/market.md) conditions while still providing potential [upside](../u/upside.md) through the purchase of the [call option](../c/call_option.md).

## Considerations and Risks

### Market Risk

The primary [risk](../r/risk.md) is the direction of the [market](../m/market.md). The [trader](../t/trader.md) must accurately predict the price movement of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) to [profit](../p/profit.md) from the strategy. Incorrect predictions can lead to losses.

### Volatility

Implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md) affects option premiums. Changes in [volatility](../v/volatility.md) can impact the profitability of the strategy. If [volatility](../v/volatility.md) increases significantly, it can lead to increased premiums on sold [put options](../p/put_options.md), resulting in potential higher losses.

### Margin Requirements

Selling a [put option](../p/put.md) represents a potential obligation to buy the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), which may require sufficient [margin](../m/margin.md) in the [trader](../t/trader.md)'s account to cover this obligation. [Margin](../m/margin.md) calls can occur if the [market](../m/market.md) moves unfavorably.

### Execution Risk

Accurate and timely [execution](../e/execution.md) of both legs of the [trade](../t/trade.md) (buying the call and selling the put) is essential. Poor [execution](../e/execution.md) can result in suboptimal fill prices, which could negatively impact the [trade](../t/trade.md) outcome.

## Advanced Strategies and Variations

### Delta Neutral Risk Reversal

A [trader](../t/trader.md) might adjust the strike prices and quantities to create a [delta](../d/delta.md)-[neutral](../n/neutral.md) position. [Delta](../d/delta.md) neutrality ensures that the position's [value](../v/value.md) is relatively insensitive to small price movements of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), focusing more on movements in [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

### Skewness Exploitation

Some traders might implement [risk](../r/risk.md) [reversal](../r/reversal.md) strategies to exploit skews in implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md) across different strike prices. This involves selecting strikes that [offer](../o/offer.md) advantageous premiums due to discrepancies in [market](../m/market.md) expectations.

### Alternative Underlying Assets

While the traditional application of [risk](../r/risk.md) [reversal](../r/reversal.md) is in [equity options](../e/equity_options.md), the strategy can also be applied to other [asset](../a/asset.md) classes, including commodities (like [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md) or gold), currencies (such as EUR/USD), and indices (like the S&P 500).

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Equity Market

A [trader](../t/trader.md) who expects the stock of ABC Inc. to rise, currently trading at $100, constructs a [risk](../r/risk.md) [reversal](../r/reversal.md):

- Buy a $110 [call option](../c/call_option.md) for $3.00
- Sell a $90 [put option](../p/put.md) for $4.00

The net [credit](../c/credit.md) received for this position is $1.00. If the stock rises to $120, the [call option](../c/call_option.md) [will](../w/will.md) be in the [money](../m/money.md), providing significant [profit](../p/profit.md). If the stock falls to $85, the put [will](../w/will.md) be exercised, but the effective [cost basis](../c/cost_basis.md) [will](../w/will.md) be $89 ([strike price](../s/strike_price.md) minus [premium](../p/premium.md) received), limiting the loss.

### Example 2: Forex Market

Consider a [trader](../t/trader.md) who expects the EUR/USD [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) to rise. The current rate is 1.1500:

- Buy a 1.1600 [call option](../c/call_option.md)
- Sell a 1.1400 [put option](../p/put.md)

If the EUR/USD rate rises above 1.1600, the [trader](../t/trader.md) profits from the [call option](../c/call_option.md). If the rate falls below 1.1400, the [trader](../t/trader.md) might be required to buy Euros at an unfavorable rate, but the [premium](../p/premium.md) received from selling the put can [offset](../o/offset.md) some of the losses.

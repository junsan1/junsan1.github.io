# Relative Strength Index (RSI)

The [Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index.md) (RSI) is one of the most widely used [momentum oscillators](../m/momentum_oscillators.md) in [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md). It was developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr. and introduced in his seminal book "New Concepts in Technical [Trading Systems](../t/trading_systems.md)" published in 1978. The RSI measures the speed and change of price movements and is typically used to identify [overbought](../o/overbought.md) or [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions in a [market](../m/market.md).

## Calculation of RSI

The RSI is calculated using the following formula:

RSI = 100 - [100 / (1 + RS)]

Where RS ([Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md)) is the average of `n` periods' up closes divided by the average of `n` periods' down closes.

Specifically, the RSI is calculated as follows:

1. **Calculate the Up and Down Moves**:
    - Up Move = Today's Close - Yesterday's Close (if positive, otherwise it is zero)
    - Down Move = Yesterday's Close - Today's Close (if positive, otherwise it is zero)

2. **Calculate the Average [Gain](../g/gain.md) and Loss**:
    - Average [Gain](../g/gain.md) = (Sum of Gains over `n` periods) / `n`
    - Average Loss = (Sum of Losses over `n` periods) / `n`

3. **Calculate the [Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) (RS)**:
    - RS = Average [Gain](../g/gain.md) / Average Loss

4. **Calculate the RSI**:
    - RSI = 100 - [100 / (1 + RS)]

Typically, the [value](../v/value.md) of `n` is set to 14 periods for a standard RSI calculation.

## Interpretation of RSI Values

- **0-30**: Indicates the [asset](../a/asset.md) may be [oversold](../o/oversold.md), suggesting a potential buying opportunity.
- **30-70**: Considered a [neutral](../n/neutral.md) or typical [range](../r/range.md) where the [asset](../a/asset.md) is neither [overbought](../o/overbought.md) nor [oversold](../o/oversold.md).
- **70-100**: Indicates the [asset](../a/asset.md) may be [overbought](../o/overbought.md), suggesting a potential selling or shorting opportunity.

## RSI Divergence

One significant aspect of RSI analysis involves identifying divergences. A [divergence](../d/divergence.md) occurs when the price of the [asset](../a/asset.md) moves in the opposite direction of the RSI. There are two types of divergences:

1. **[Bullish Divergence](../b/bullish_divergence.md)**:
    - Occurs when the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s price makes a new low but the RSI makes a higher low.
    - This can indicate that the selling [momentum](../m/momentum.md) is weakening, potentially signaling a [reversal](../r/reversal.md) to the [upside](../u/upside.md).

2. **[Bearish Divergence](../b/bearish_divergence.md)**:
    - Occurs when the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s price makes a new high but the RSI makes a lower high.
    - This can indicate that the buying [momentum](../m/momentum.md) is weakening, potentially signaling a [reversal](../r/reversal.md) to the downside.

## RSI Variants

Over time, traders and analysts have developed several modifications and variants of the RSI to enhance its [utility](../u/utility.md). Some of these include:

1. **Stochastic RSI**:
    - Combines elements of the [Stochastic Oscillator](../s/stochastic_oscillator.md) with the RSI to generate more sensitive and potentially more timely signals.
    - It is calculated by applying the Stochastic formula to the RSI values instead of price values.

2. **RSI with Different Look-Back Periods**:
    - Traders sometimes adjust the look-back period (e.g., 9 or 21 periods instead of the standard 14) to increase or decrease the sensitivity of the RSI to recent price changes.

## Applications in Trading Strategies

The RSI can be employed in various [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), often in conjunction with other [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) to enhance decision-making. Here are some common strategies:

1. **RSI [Overbought](../o/overbought.md)/[Oversold](../o/oversold.md) Strategy**:
    - Enters buy positions when the RSI falls below 30 and subsequently rises back above it.
    - Enters sell positions when the RSI rises above 70 and subsequently falls back below it.

2. **RSI [Divergence](../d/divergence.md)**:
    - Focuses on identifying [divergence](../d/divergence.md) between RSI and price to predict potential reversals.
    
3. **RSI [Trendline](../t/trendline.md) Strategy**:
    - Utilizes trendlines drawn on the RSI itself to identify potential breakouts or breakdowns.
    
4. **Combining RSI with Moving Averages**:
    - Employs moving averages to identify the overall [trend](../t/trend.md) and uses RSI to find optimal entry and exit points within that [trend](../t/trend.md).

5. **RSI & MACD Combination**:
    - Uses both RSI and the Moving Average Convergence [Divergence](../d/divergence.md) (MACD) to confirm [trade](../t/trade.md) signals, ensuring that both [momentum](../m/momentum.md) and [trend](../t/trend.md) conditions are aligned.

## Practical Implementation

Implementing RSI-based strategies involves the use of trading platforms and software that support [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md). Some popular platforms where RSI can be utilized include:

1. **MetaTrader 4/5**:
    - Offers RSI as a standard [indicator](../i/indicator.md) with customizable parameters.
    
2. **[TradingView](../t/tradingview.md)**:
    - Provides a highly interactive charting platform with RSI and other [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) available. [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com)
    
3. **[Thinkorswim](../t/thinkorswim.md)** by TD [Ameritrade](../a/ameritrade.md):

4. **[NinjaTrader](../n/ninjatrader.md)**:
    - Offers RSI and other [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) indicators for advanced charting.

## Limitations of RSI

While RSI is a powerful tool, it is not without limitations:

1. **[False Signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md)**:
    - RSI may generate [false signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md), especially in highly volatile markets where price movements are erratic.
    
2. **[Lagging Indicator](../l/lagging_indicator.md)**:
    - As a [momentum](../m/momentum.md) [oscillator](../o/oscillator.md), RSI may sometimes lag behind actual price movements, causing delayed entry or exit points.
    
3. **Performance in Trending Markets**:
    - RSI may be less effective in strong trending markets, where it can remain in [overbought](../o/overbought.md) or [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions for extended periods.

## Conclusion

The [Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index.md) (RSI) remains an essential tool in the arsenal of both novice and experienced traders. By measuring the [momentum](../m/momentum.md) of price movements, it offers valuable insights into potential [overbought](../o/overbought.md) or [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions, [trend](../t/trend.md) reversals, and [market](../m/market.md) divergences. However, it is crucial to combine RSI with other [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) and [robust](../r/robust.md) [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) strategies to maximize its effectiveness and minimize potential drawbacks.

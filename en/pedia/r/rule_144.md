# Rule 144

Rule 144 is a regulation enforced by the U.S. Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) that provides guidelines for the resale of restricted and control securities. This rule is a critical part of the regulatory framework in the U.S. [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), and understanding its intricacies is crucial for companies, investors, and legal practitioners dealing in securities. Below, we delve into the various aspects of Rule 144, including its purpose, key provisions, requirements for resale, and its impact on the financial [market](../m/market.md).

## Purpose of Rule 144

The primary purpose of Rule 144 is to provide a safe harbor for the resale of restricted and control securities, ensuring that ordinary investors are adequately protected while allowing securities to remain relatively [liquid](../l/liquid.md). Rule 144 aims to:
- Facilitate the resale of securities while preventing [fraud](../f/fraud.md) and manipulation.
- Ensure that the resale of restricted securities occurs in compliance with the [Securities Act of 1933](../s/securities_act_of_1933.md).
- Enable insiders or affiliates of a company to comply with securities laws when reselling their [holdings](../h/holdings.md).

## Key Provisions of Rule 144

### 1. Restricted Securities
Restricted securities are acquired through means other than a public [offering](../o/offering.md)â€”for example, through a [private placement](../p/private_placement.md). These securities cannot be sold publicly without registration or an applicable [exemption](../e/exemption.md) from registration. Rule 144 provides one such [exemption](../e/exemption.md).

### 2. Control Securities
Control securities are owned by an affiliate of the issuing company. Affiliates are typically directors, officers, or significant shareholders who have the power to influence the company.

### 3. Holding Period
The securities must be held for a specific period before they can be sold under Rule 144:
- For reporting companies (public companies), the [holding period](../h/holding_period.md) is six months.
- For non-reporting companies (private companies), the [holding period](../h/holding_period.md) is one year.

### 4. Adequate Current Information
The issuing company must provide adequate current information. For reporting companies, this means compliance with periodic reporting requirements under the [Securities Exchange Act of 1934](../s/securities_exchange_act_of_1934.md). For non-reporting companies, sufficient public information must be available about the company.

### 5. Trading Volume Formula
Affiliates are subject to the trading [volume](../v/volume.md) formula, limiting the amount of securities that can be sold within a 90-day period. The [volume](../v/volume.md) limit is the greater of:
- 1% of the outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md); or
- The average weekly trading [volume](../v/volume.md) over the preceding four weeks.

### 6. Ordinary Brokerage Transactions
Sales must be handled as routine trading transactions, with brokers receiving only normal commissions and performing standard duties.

### 7. Filing Form 144
Affiliates intending to sell more than 5,000 [shares](../s/shares.md) or securities valued over $50,000 in any three-month period must file [Form 144](../f/form_144.md) with the SEC, indicating the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) to be sold and other relevant details.

## Requirements for Resale Under Rule 144

To resell restricted or control securities under Rule 144, investors must meet several key requirements:

### Non-Affiliate Sales
When a non-affiliate (typically someone who does not have a significant influence over the company) intends to resell restricted securities, they must ensure:
- They [hold](../h/hold.md) the securities for the appropriate [holding period](../h/holding_period.md).
- The company provides adequate current information.
- There is no restriction on the method of [sale](../s/sale.md) or filing [Form 144](../f/form_144.md).

### Affiliate Sales
When an affiliate (insider with significant influence over the company) intends to sell restricted or control securities, they must comply with:
- [Holding period](../h/holding_period.md) requirements.
- Adequate current information [provision](../p/provision.md).
- Adherence to the trading [volume](../v/volume.md) formula.
- [Sale](../s/sale.md) conducted as an ordinary brokerage [transaction](../t/transaction.md).
- Filing [Form 144](../f/form_144.md) if required.

## Impact of Rule 144 on Financial Markets

Rule 144 plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance between [market](../m/market.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and [investor](../i/investor.md) protection. By providing a structured framework for the resale of restricted and control securities, Rule 144 has several notable impacts:

### Stability and Liquidity
Rule 144 promotes [market](../m/market.md) stability and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) by allowing securities to enter the public [market](../m/market.md) under regulated conditions. This fosters [investor](../i/investor.md) confidence and encourages [market](../m/market.md) participation.

### Investor Protection
The rule ensures that companies disclose adequate current information, allowing investors to make informed decisions. It also mitigates the [risk](../r/risk.md) of [market manipulation](../m/market_manipulation.md) by regulating the resale practices of affiliates and insiders.

### Broader Investment Opportunities
By facilitating the legal resale of restricted securities, Rule 144 increases the attractiveness of private placements and other methods of securities [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md), widening the array of investment opportunities available to investors.

### Enhanced Compliance
For companies, compliance with Rule 144 is an important aspect of adhering to U.S. securities laws. This compliance helps prevent legal repercussions and enhances [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) standards.

## Practical Examples and Case Studies

### Example 1: Private Placement to Public Offering
An emerging tech company issues restricted securities through a [private placement](../p/private_placement.md) to a [venture capital](../v/venture_capital.md) [firm](../f/firm.md). After holding the securities for six months, the [venture capital](../v/venture_capital.md) [firm](../f/firm.md) decides to resell the securities to the public. Following Rule 144, the [firm](../f/firm.md) ensures that the tech company is compliant with SEC reporting requirements, files [Form 144](../f/form_144.md), and resells the securities without violating the [volume](../v/volume.md) limitations.

### Example 2: Insider Trading Compliance
A director of a publicly traded pharmaceutical company owns a significant number of control securities. The director wants to sell a portion of their [holdings](../h/holdings.md). To comply with Rule 144, the director holds the [shares](../s/shares.md) for six months, verifies that the company has filed its most recent quarterly [earnings report](../e/earnings_report.md), adheres to the trading [volume](../v/volume.md) formula, and files [Form 144](../f/form_144.md) to disclose the intended [sale](../s/sale.md).

## Conclusion

Rule 144 stands as a cornerstone of the SEC's regulatory framework, balancing the need for [market](../m/market.md) fluidity with [investor](../i/investor.md) protection. Its comprehensive guidelines for the resale of restricted and control securities ensure that markets operate fairly, transparently, and efficiently. For companies, affiliates, and investors, a thorough understanding of Rule 144 is indispensable for navigating the complexities of securities transactions in the U.S. [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

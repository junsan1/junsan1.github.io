# Realtor

A Realtor is a [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) professional who is a member of the National Association of Realtors (NAR). This designation distinguishes them from other [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) agents and brokers, indicating that they comply with NAR's strict ethical guidelines and standards. NAR is the largest [trade](../t/trade.md) association in the United States, whose membership includes residential and [commercial real estate](../c/commercial_real_estate.md) brokers, salespeople, property managers, appraisers, counselors, and other [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) professionals.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Property Listing

A Realtor assists clients in listing their properties for [sale](../s/sale.md). This includes evaluating the propertyâ€™s [value](../v/value.md), suggesting improvements to optimize the [sale](../s/sale.md) price, and [marketing](../m/marketing.md) the property through [multiple](../m/multiple.md) channels such as online listings, print media, and [open](../o/open.md) houses.

### Buyer Representation

Realtors also represent buyers, helping them find properties that meet their criteria. They use their extensive network and MLS ([Multiple](../m/multiple.md) Listing Service) access to provide a wide selection of [options](../o/options.md). Realtors analyze [market](../m/market.md) conditions to ensure buyers pay a fair price.

### Negotiation

One of the most critical functions of a Realtor is negotiating on behalf of their clients. Whether representing the buyer or the seller, they aim to secure the most favorable terms. This involves understanding the intricacies of contracts, contingencies, and local [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) laws.

### Market Analysis

Realtors conduct comparative [market](../m/market.md) analyses (CMA) to determine [market](../m/market.md) trends and property values. This information helps both buyers and sellers make informed decisions. Realtors use various data points, such as recent sales and pricing trends, to provide accurate [market](../m/market.md) assessments.

### Paperwork and Legalities

Realtors [handle](../h/handle.md) the myriad paperwork involved in [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) transactions. This includes drafting contracts, [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) forms, and other legal documents. They ensure that all paperwork complies with state and federal laws, reducing the [risk](../r/risk.md) of legal issues down the line.

### Networking

A successful Realtor maintains a broad network of [industry](../i/industry.md) professionals, including other [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) agents, brokers, [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) lenders, appraisers, inspectors, and contractors. This network allows them to provide comprehensive services to their clients, from finding the right [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) to [home](../h/home.md) repairs and upgrades.

## Ethical Standards

### Code of Ethics

Realtors are bound by the NAR's [Code of Ethics](../c/code_of_ethics.md), which requires them to [uphold](../u/uphold.md) principles such as honesty, integrity, fairness, and professionalism. The code includes 17 articles that outline duties to clients, the public, and other Realtors.

### Continuing Education

To maintain their Realtor designation, members must complete continuing education courses. These courses ensure that Realtors stay updated with changes in [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) laws, [market](../m/market.md) trends, and [best practices](../b/best_practices.md).

## Types of Realtors

### Residential Realtors

These professionals focus on residential properties, helping individuals and families buy or sell homes. They provide services such as property staging, [open](../o/open.md) houses, and [home](../h/home.md) valuations.

### Commercial Realtors

Commercial Realtors specialize in properties used for [business](../b/business.md) purposes, such as retail spaces, office buildings, and industrial properties. They [handle](../h/handle.md) more complex transactions that often involve longer timelines and higher stakes.

### Realtor-Associates

A Realtor-Associate is a licensed [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) professional working under the supervision of a more experienced [broker](../b/broker.md). They perform many of the same tasks as more seasoned Realtors but often focus on client [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) and initial consultations.

### Broker-Realtor

A [Broker](../b/broker.md)-Realtor has additional qualifications that allow them to supervise other [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) agents. They can operate independently, own [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) firms, and have additional responsibilities such as managing brokerage operations.

## Technology in Real Estate

### MLS (Multiple Listing Service)

The MLS is a comprehensive database used by Realtors to list and search for properties. It offers a centralized system that contains property details, [transaction](../t/transaction.md) history, and professional [networking](../n/networking.md) [options](../o/options.md).

### Real Estate Websites and Apps

Modern Realtors frequently use websites and mobile apps for property listings, virtual tours, and communication with clients. Websites like Zillow, Realtor.com, and Redfin provide platforms for listing homes, evaluating [market](../m/market.md) trends, and connecting with potential buyers and sellers.

### Virtual Tours

Virtual tours and augmented reality (AR) tools allow potential buyers to explore properties remotely. This technology has become increasingly popular, especially in light of social distancing measures necessitated by events like the COVID-19 pandemic.

### CRM Systems

[Customer](../c/customer.md) [Relationship Management](../r/relationship_management.md) (CRM) systems help Realtors manage their client interactions, track leads, and automate follow-ups. These systems are crucial for maintaining client relationships and ensuring that no opportunity is missed.

## Economic Impact

### Real Estate Market Cycles

Realtors play a significant role in the [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) [market](../m/market.md), which is subject to cycles of growth and decline. Understanding these cycles helps Realtors advise their clients on the best times to buy or sell property.

### Job Creation

The [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) [industry](../i/industry.md) generates a considerable number of jobs, not only for Realtors but also for related professions like appraisers, inspectors, and [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) brokers. Realtors contribute to job creation by facilitating property transactions that often lead to economic activities like [home](../h/home.md) renovations and new construction.

### Tax Revenues

[Real estate](../r/real_estate.md) transactions generate significant tax revenues for local, state, and federal governments. These include property [taxes](../t/taxes.md), transfer [taxes](../t/taxes.md), and [income](../i/income.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) on profits from [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) sales. Realtors help ensure these transactions are completed accurately and efficiently, benefiting public finances.

## Conclusion

Realtors serve a critical function in the [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) [market](../m/market.md) by providing expert [guidance](../g/guidance.md), negotiating deals, and ensuring compliance with legal requirements. Their adherence to [ethical standards](../e/ethical_standards_in_trading.md) and their utilization of modern technology make them indispensable in [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) transactions. From residential to commercial properties, Realtors [offer](../o/offer.md) a [range](../r/range.md) of specialized services that contribute significantly to the [economy](../e/economy.md) and the well-being of their clients.

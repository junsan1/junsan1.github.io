# Rolling Returns

## Introduction
Rolling returns, also known as rolling period returns or time period returns, is a method used in the evaluation of the performance of an investment over various time frames. Instead of relying on point-to-point [return](../r/return.md) analysis, which can sometimes [offer](../o/offer.md) a limited view, rolling returns provide a more comprehensive picture by [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for the changing [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md) profile over time. This method is instrumental in understanding the consistency of returns, the investment's behavior in varying [market](../m/market.md) conditions, and in comparing [multiple](../m/multiple.md) investments.

### Key Definitions
- **Rolling Period**: The time frame over which the [return](../r/return.md) is calculated. Typical rolling periods include one month, three months, six months, one year, three years, and five years.
- **Window Size**: The length of the period for which returns are calculated. For instance, a 3-year rolling [return](../r/return.md) might be calculated monthly over a 5-year span.
- **Overlap**: In rolling returns, periods often overlap, unlike fixed-period returns, [offering](../o/offering.md) a more granular view.

## Calculation of Rolling Returns
The calculation involves several steps:
1. **Choosing the Rolling Period**: Decide on the time frame for which the rolling [return](../r/return.md) [will](../w/will.md) be calculated.
2. **Setting the Window Size**: Define how frequently the returns need to be calculated within the chosen rolling period.
3. **Algorithm**: Implement the rolling function that recalculates returns for each period:
   - For example, to calculate a 1-year rolling [return](../r/return.md) on a monthly [basis](../b/basis.md) over a 5-year span, returns are calculated in 5-year windows that [roll forward](../r/roll_forward.md) each month.
  
The formula for rolling returns relatively remains the same as the general [return](../r/return.md) formula:
\[ \text{[Return](../r/return.md)} = \frac{(P_{end} - P_{start}) + D}{P_{start}} \]
Where:
- \( P_{end} \) = Ending price
- \( P_{start} \) = Starting price
- \( D \) = Dividends received during the period

## Practical Example
Consider an investment with monthly [return](../r/return.md) data over a 5-year span. To calculate a 1-year rolling [return](../r/return.md):
1. Start with the first 12 months and calculate the [return](../r/return.md).
2. Move forward one month and calculate the [return](../r/return.md) for the next 12 months.
3. Repeat this process until the end of the available data.

Assuming we are calculating returns for an investment in stock XYZ:
- January 2020 to January 2021 returns
- February 2020 to February 2021 returns
- Continue this pattern until the last 12-month period within the data.

## Tools and Software
Several tools can be employed to calculate and visualize rolling returns:
- **Excel**: Use formulas and pivot tables to perform rolling [return](../r/return.md) calculations.
- **Python**: Libraries like pandas and matplotlib make it easy to calculate and plot rolling returns.
- **MATLAB**: Provides functions like `movmean` or custom scripts for rolling [return](../r/return.md) calculations.
- **R**: Libraries like `zoo` and `xts` are specifically designed for handling [time series analysis](../t/time_series_analysis.md).

## Companies Using Rolling Returns
Rolling returns are widely used by various financial institutions, investment firms, and analysis companies. Some of the notable companies include:
- **[Morningstar](../m/morningstar.md)**, a leading provider of independent investment research ([morningstar](../m/morningstar.md).com)
- **Vanguard**, a significant player in mutual funds and ETFs (vanguard.com)
- **BlackRock**, a global [investment management](../i/investment_management.md) [corporation](../c/corporation.md) (blackrock.com)

Each of these companies uses rolling returns to present comprehensive performance analysis of funds and investment strategies to their clients.

## Advantages of Rolling Returns
- **Consistency**: By smoothing out short-term [volatility](../v/volatility.md), rolling returns can demonstrate the consistency of an investment's performance over different periods.
- **[Comparative Analysis](../c/comparative_analysis.md)**: They allow for better comparison of different assets or funds over identical time frames.
- **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Assessment**: Rolling returns help in understanding the [risk](../r/risk.md) and [volatility](../v/volatility.md) associated with an investment over time.

## Challenges and Limitations
- **Complexity**: Calculating and interpreting rolling returns can be more complex compared to simple point-to-point returns.
- **Data Requirements**: Continuous data over long periods is required to compute rolling returns effectively.
- **Overlap Influence**: Since the periods overlap, similar [market](../m/market.md) events may influence [multiple](../m/multiple.md) rolling periods, potentially skewing the results.

## Conclusion
Rolling returns provide a dynamic and [robust](../r/robust.md) method for evaluating an investment's performance. By [offering](../o/offering.md) insights into consistency, [risk](../r/risk.md), and comparative performance, they are an invaluable tool for investors and analysts. While there are challenges associated with their complexity and data requirements, the advantages far outweigh these drawbacks.

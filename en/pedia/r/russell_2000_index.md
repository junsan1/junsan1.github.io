# Russell 2000 Index

The Russell 2000 [Index](../i/index.md) is a widely recognized small-cap stock [index](../i/index.md) representing the smallest 2,000 [stocks](../s/stock.md) in the [Russell 3000 Index](../r/russell_3000_index.md). It was first introduced by the Frank Russell Company in 1984 and is a key [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for small-cap U.S. equities. This [index](../i/index.md) includes the bottom 2,000 [stocks](../s/stock.md) by [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) and provides comprehensive coverage of the investable small-cap segment of the American [equity market](../e/equity_market.md). Over the years, the Russell 2000 has become one of the most commonly quoted and referenced stock indices in the financial world, particularly for investment strategies focusing on small-cap companies.

## Components and Methodology

The Russell 2000 [Index](../i/index.md) is constructed using a rules-based methodology that includes the following steps:

### Selection of Universe

The entire [Russell 3000 Index](../r/russell_3000_index.md) is used as the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) universe. The Russell 3000 itself is composed of the 3,000 largest publicly-traded U.S. companies based on total [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md).

### Market Capitalization

[Stocks](../s/stock.md) are ranked and sorted by their total [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md). The smallest 2,000 [stocks](../s/stock.md) in the [Russell 3000 index](../r/russell_3000_index.md) are then selected to form the Russell 2000 [Index](../i/index.md). This [market](../m/market.md) cap allocation ensures that the [index](../i/index.md) reflects the small-cap segment of the [market](../m/market.md).

### Reconstitution

One of the key features of the Russell indices is their annual reconstitution. Every June, the indices are updated to ensure that they remain an accurate reflection of the [market](../m/market.md). During this period, [stocks](../s/stock.md) may be added or removed based on their [market](../m/market.md) cap rankings.

### Weighting

The Russell 2000 is a [market](../m/market.md)-[capitalization](../c/capitalization.md)-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) [index](../i/index.md), meaning that each stock's weight in the [index](../i/index.md) is proportional to its [market](../m/market.md) cap. [Stocks](../s/stock.md) with larger [market](../m/market.md) caps have a larger influence on the [index](../i/index.md)â€™s performance.

## Performance Metrics

Investors use several [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md) to evaluate the Russell 2000 [Index](../i/index.md):

### Total Return

The [total return](../t/total_return.md) of the Russell 2000 [Index](../i/index.md) includes both price returns and the [reinvestment](../r/reinvestment.md) of dividends. This gives a comprehensive measure of the performance, including [income](../i/income.md) from dividends.

### Price Return

Price [return](../r/return.md) measures just the change in the [market price](../m/market_price.md) of the [index](../i/index.md) components without [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for dividends. This is commonly used to gauge [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) and [capital](../c/capital.md) appreciation.

### Volatility

[Volatility](../v/volatility.md) is a measure of the price fluctuations of the [stocks](../s/stock.md) in the [index](../i/index.md). The Russell 2000 [Index](../i/index.md) tends to be more volatile compared to large-cap indices like the S&P 500, reflecting the higher [risk](../r/risk.md) and reward potential of small-cap [stocks](../s/stock.md).

### Tracking Error

[Tracking error](../t/tracking_error.md) evaluates how closely an [index fund](../i/index_fund.md) or ETF mimics the performance of the Russell 2000 [Index](../i/index.md). Lower [tracking error](../t/tracking_error.md) indicates a more accurate replication of the [index](../i/index.md).

## Investment Vehicles

There are several ways for investors to [gain](../g/gain.md) exposure to the Russell 2000 [Index](../i/index.md):

### ETFs

[Exchange](../e/exchange.md)-Traded Funds (ETFs) replicating the Russell 2000 [Index](../i/index.md) are a popular [investment vehicle](../i/investment_vehicle.md). Some of the most well-known ETFs are:

- **[iShares](../i/ishares.md) Russell 2000 ETF (IWM)**: One of the largest and most [liquid](../l/liquid.md) ETFs tracking the Russell 2000.
- **Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF (VTWO)**: A cost-effective option for gaining exposure to small-cap [stocks](../s/stock.md).

### Mutual Funds

Several mutual funds aim to replicate or [outperform](../o/outperform.md) the Russell 2000 [Index](../i/index.md). These funds often employ [active management](../a/active_management.md) strategies to potentially deliver higher returns.

### Futures and Options

The Russell 2000 is also available through [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) and [options](../o/options.md) trading. These financial instruments provide more sophisticated traders with the ability to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) or speculate on the [index](../i/index.md)'s performance.

### Stock Picking

Individual investors may choose to construct their own portfolios by picking [stocks](../s/stock.md) that are part of the Russell 2000 [Index](../i/index.md).

## Economic Significance

### Indicator of Small-Cap Performance

The Russell 2000 is often seen as a [leading indicator](../l/leading_indicator.md) of small-cap performance. It provides insight into [investor](../i/investor.md) sentiment towards smaller companies, which often react differently to economic changes compared to [large-cap stocks](../l/large_cap_stocks.md).

### Market Sentiment

Since small-cap [stocks](../s/stock.md) are more volatile and sensitive to economic changes, the Russell 2000 can serve as a barometer for [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) and economic forecasts.

### Portfolio Diversification

Investors use the Russell 2000 [Index](../i/index.md) to diversify their portfolios. Small-cap [stocks](../s/stock.md) often have performance cycles that are different from [large-cap stocks](../l/large_cap_stocks.md), providing a [diversification](../d/diversification.md) benefit.

## Comparisons with Other Indices

### S&P 500

The S&P 500 [Index](../i/index.md) includes the 500 largest U.S. companies and is often used as a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for the overall [market](../m/market.md). The Russell 2000, on the other hand, focuses exclusively on small-cap [stocks](../s/stock.md). While the S&P 500 tends to be less volatile, the Russell 2000 offers potentially higher returns due to its exposure to smaller, growing companies.

### Russell 1000

The [Russell 1000 Index](../r/russell_1000_index.md) covers the largest 1,000 [stocks](../s/stock.md) in the [Russell 3000 Index](../r/russell_3000_index.md), representing large-cap and [mid-cap stocks](../m/mid-cap_stocks.md). The Russell 2000 complements the Russell 1000, providing a comprehensive view when both indices are considered together.

### NASDAQ Composite

The [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md) Composite includes over 2,500 [stocks](../s/stock.md) and is heavily [weighted](../w/weighted.md) towards technology and innovation-driven companies. In contrast, the Russell 2000 offers broader sector exposure and focuses on smaller companies.

## Historical Performance

### Long-Term Trends

Historically, the Russell 2000 [Index](../i/index.md) has shown considerable growth, alongside periods of significant [volatility](../v/volatility.md). Over the long term, small-cap [stocks](../s/stock.md) have tended to [outperform](../o/outperform.md) [large-cap stocks](../l/large_cap_stocks.md), although they come with higher [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Economic Cycles

The performance of the Russell 2000 [Index](../i/index.md) is closely tied to [economic cycles](../e/economic_cycles.md). [Small caps](../s/small_caps.md) typically [outperform](../o/outperform.md) during economic recoveries and expansions but may [underperform](../u/underperform.md) during economic downturns.

### Key Milestones

- **1984**: Introduction of the Russell 2000.
- **1990s**: The tech boom saw significant gains in small-cap [stocks](../s/stock.md).
- **2008**: The [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) led to a sharp decline, but a strong recovery followed.
- **2020**: COVID-19 pandemic caused [volatility](../v/volatility.md), yet the [index](../i/index.md) quickly rebounded.

Providers like [Bloomberg](../b/bloomberg.md), [Reuters](../r/reuters.md), and [interactive brokers](../i/interactive_brokers.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) comprehensive data solutions.

### Trading Strategies

#### Mean Reversion

[Mean reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md) strategies assume that stock prices [will](../w/will.md) revert to their historical average over time. By studying the historical price movements of the Russell 2000, traders can develop algorithms that exploit deviations from the mean.

#### Momentum Trading

[Momentum trading](../m/momentum_trading.md) involves capitalizing on trends and price movements. Traders track the [relative strength](../r/relative_strength.md) of the [stocks](../s/stock.md) within the Russell 2000 to determine buy and sell signals.

#### Arbitrage

[Pairs trading](../p/pairs_trading.md) and statistical [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) can be applied to Russell 2000 [stocks](../s/stock.md). By identifying correlated [stocks](../s/stock.md) and exploiting pricing inefficiencies, algorithmic traders aim to generate low-[risk](../r/risk.md) profits.

### Risk Management

[Risk management](../r/risk_management.md) is crucial when trading small-cap [stocks](../s/stock.md) due to their higher [volatility](../v/volatility.md). Techniques used include [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md), [position sizing](../p/position_sizing.md), and [portfolio diversification](../p/portfolio_diversification.md).

## Conclusion

The Russell 2000 [Index](../i/index.md) offers invaluable insights into the performance of small-cap [stocks](../s/stock.md) and serves as a crucial [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for investors seeking exposure to this segment of the [market](../m/market.md). With a wide [range](../r/range.md) of investment vehicles, including ETFs, mutual funds, and [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), it provides [multiple](../m/multiple.md) avenues for both individual and institutional investors. Additionally, the [index](../i/index.md) plays a significant role in [economic forecasting](../e/economic_forecasting.md) and [portfolio diversification](../p/portfolio_diversification.md), making it an essential tool for traders and investors alike.

# Reverse Stock Split

A reverse [stock split](../s/stock_split.md), also known as a stock [consolidation](../c/consolidation.md) or share rollback, is a corporate action in which a company reduces the total number of its outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md) of stock, while simultaneously increasing the price per share. This maneuver is typically executed to meet certain regulatory requirements or to enhance the [perceived value](../p/perceived_value.md) of the stock. Unlike a forward [stock split](../s/stock_split.md), which increases the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) and decreases the price per share, a reverse [stock split](../s/stock_split.md) achieves the opposite effect.  

## Purpose and Rationale

Several reasons can lead a company to initiate a reverse [stock split](../s/stock_split.md). Here are some of the primary motivations behind such a move:

### 1. Compliance with Stock Exchange Requirements

Many stock exchanges have minimum price requirements that [listed](../l/listed.md) companies must meet to continue trading on the [exchange](../e/exchange.md). For instance, the [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) requires a minimum [bid price](../b/bid_price.md) of $1. If a company's stock price falls below this threshold, it risks being delisted. A reverse [stock split](../s/stock_split.md) can bring the stock price back above the minimum requirement, thus allowing the company to maintain its listing.

### 2. Enhancing Perceived Value

[Stocks](../s/stock.md) trading at extremely low prices are often perceived as "[penny stocks](../p/penny_stocks.md)," which can attract speculative and [short-term trading](../s/short-term_trading.md) rather than serious, long-term investment. By increasing the price per share through a reverse [stock split](../s/stock_split.md), a company can potentially attract a different class of investors, who may regard the stock as more credible and worthy of investment.

### 3. Reducing Transaction Costs

For investors, [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md) can be higher for lower-priced [stocks](../s/stock.md). Brokerage fees are often charged per share, so a higher-priced stock resulting from a reverse [stock split](../s/stock_split.md) could potentially reduce [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md) and improve [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).

### 4. Improved Institutional Investment

Some institutional investors, such as mutual funds and pension funds, may have investment guidelines that prevent them from purchasing [stocks](../s/stock.md) below a certain price. By increasing the stock price through a reverse split, the company may become eligible for inclusion in these institutional portfolios.

## Mechanics of a Reverse Stock Split

The mechanics of a reverse [stock split](../s/stock_split.md) are straightforward but require careful [execution](../e/execution.md) to maintain [shareholder value](../s/shareholder_value.md). Here’s how the process works:

### 1. Board Approval and Announcement

First, the company’s board of directors must approve the reverse [stock split](../s/stock_split.md). Once approved, the company announces the reverse [stock split](../s/stock_split.md) to its shareholders, regulatory bodies, and the public. This announcement typically includes the ratio of the split (e.g., 1-for-10, meaning shareholders [will](../w/will.md) receive one new share for every ten [shares](../s/shares.md) they currently [hold](../h/hold.md)) and the effective date of the split.

### 2. Shareholder Approval (if required)

In some cases, [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) approval is required to execute a reverse [stock split](../s/stock_split.md), particularly if it involves significant changes to the [corporate charter](../c/corporate_charter.md).

### 3. Adjustment of Outstanding Shares

On the effective date, the company's outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md) are reduced according to the split ratio. For example, in a 1-for-10 reverse [stock split](../s/stock_split.md), an [investor](../i/investor.md) holding 1,000 [shares](../s/shares.md) would see their [holdings](../h/holdings.md) reduced to 100 [shares](../s/shares.md), but with each share's price correspondingly increasing by a [factor](../f/factor.md) of 10.

### 4. Post-Split Adjustment

The company’s [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) remains [unchanged](../u/unchanged.md) after the reverse split, as the reduction in the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) is [offset](../o/offset.md) by the increase in price per share. Regulatory filings and [exchange](../e/exchange.md) notifications are updated to reflect the new share structure.

## Real-World Examples

### 1. AIG (American International Group): 

American International Group (AIG) executed a 1-for-20 reverse [stock split](../s/stock_split.md) in 2009. The move was aimed at avoiding [delisting](../d/delisting.md) from the New York Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (NYSE) and to stabilize the stock price in the aftermath of the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md).

### 2. Citigroup:

Citigroup executed a 1-for-10 reverse [stock split](../s/stock_split.md) in 2011. The objective was to raise the share price above $40 to attract institutional investors and reduce the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) in the [market](../m/market.md).

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

1. **Compliance with [Listing Requirements](../l/listing_requirements.md)**: Helps companies meet [exchange](../e/exchange.md) [listing requirements](../l/listing_requirements.md) for minimum stock price.
2. **Enhances [Perceived Value](../p/perceived_value.md)**: Can make a stock more attractive to investors by eliminating the stigma of being a "[penny stock](../p/penny_stock.md)".
3. **Reduces [Transaction Costs](../t/transaction_costs.md)**: Can lower brokerage fees for investors, potentially improving [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md).
4. **Institutional Investment**: Makes the stock eligible for purchase by institutional investors who have minimum price criteria.

### Cons

1. **Negative Perception**: Often viewed as a sign that a company is struggling, which can create negative [investor](../i/investor.md) sentiment.
2. **Temporary Fix**: Does not address [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [business](../b/business.md) issues causing the stock price to drop in the first place.
3. **[Dilution](../d/dilution.md) Fear**: Shareholders may fear future [dilution](../d/dilution.md) despite the reverse split, especially if the company issues new [shares](../s/shares.md) later.
4. **[Market](../m/market.md) Reaction**: A reverse [stock split](../s/stock_split.md) can lead to increased [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and speculative trading.

## Legal and Regulatory Considerations

Executing a reverse [stock split](../s/stock_split.md) involves several legal and regulatory steps. The company must file the appropriate documentation with the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) and comply with specific stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rules. This includes amending the [corporate charter](../c/corporate_charter.md) if necessary and seeking [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) approval, depending on the jurisdiction and the extent of changes proposed.

### SEC Filings

Companies must file an [8-K form](../1/8-k_form.md) with the SEC to disclose the intention and details of the reverse [stock split](../s/stock_split.md). This form includes information about the split ratio, the effective date, and potential impacts on shareholders.

### Exchange Notifications

Both the NYSE and [Nasdaq](../n/nasdaq.md) require companies to notify the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) of a reverse [stock split](../s/stock_split.md). The notification must be filed at least 10 days before the effective date. This allows the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) to update its records and systems to reflect the new share structure.

## Conclusion

A reverse [stock split](../s/stock_split.md) is a significant corporate action that serves various strategic purposes, from maintaining [exchange](../e/exchange.md) listings to enhancing the stock's [perceived value](../p/perceived_value.md). While it can [offer](../o/offer.md) several benefits, it also carries risks and potential downsides that both the company and its shareholders must carefully consider. Proper [execution](../e/execution.md) and transparent communication are crucial for the successful implementation of a reverse [stock split](../s/stock_split.md), ensuring that the company's objectives are met without causing undue disruption to its stock price or [investor relations](../i/investor_relations.md).

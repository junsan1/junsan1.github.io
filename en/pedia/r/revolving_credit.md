# Revolving Credit

Revolving [credit](../c/credit.md) is a type of [credit](../c/credit.md) that does not have a fixed number of payments, in contrast to installment [credit](../c/credit.md). Borrowing in this manner allows consumers and businesses to continuously access funds up to a predetermined limit, repaying the borrowed amount, and drawing from it again as needed. This flexibility and convenience make revolving [credit](../c/credit.md) a popular choice for managing [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md), both for personal finances and [business](../b/business.md) operations. It's often linked with [credit](../c/credit.md) cards, but it also applies to lines of [credit](../c/credit.md) and other financial instruments.

## How Revolving Credit Works

When a revolving [credit](../c/credit.md) account is opened, the [lender](../l/lender.md) (usually a [bank](../b/bank.md) or [credit](../c/credit.md) union) sets a [credit limit](../c/credit_limit.md), which is the maximum amount that can be borrowed at any time. The borrower can then draw funds from the account as long as they do not exceed the [credit limit](../c/credit_limit.md). Each month, the borrower is required to make a minimum [payment](../p/payment.md), which is typically a percentage of the outstanding balance. As they repay the borrowed funds, the available [credit](../c/credit.md) amount is replenished, allowing the borrower to use it again.

The [interest](../i/interest.md) is charged based on the outstanding balance and not the [credit limit](../c/credit_limit.md). This means that borrowers only pay [interest](../i/interest.md) on the amount they have actually used, not on the entire [credit limit](../c/credit_limit.md) available to them.

## Key Characteristics of Revolving Credit

1. **[Credit Limit](../c/credit_limit.md)**: The maximum amount of [credit](../c/credit.md) available to the borrower.
2. **Flexible [Repayment](../r/repayment.md)**: Borrowers can choose to repay the full amount owed or make a minimum [payment](../p/payment.md).
3. **[Interest](../i/interest.md) Rates**: [Interest](../i/interest.md) is charged on the outstanding balance, not the total [credit limit](../c/credit_limit.md).
4. **Renewable Use**: As balance is paid down, [credit](../c/credit.md) becomes available again.
5. **Account Maintenance Fees**: Some revolving [credit](../c/credit.md) accounts may have annual or monthly maintenance fees.

## Types of Revolving Credit

### Credit Cards

[Credit](../c/credit.md) cards are the most common type of revolving [credit](../c/credit.md). They [offer](../o/offer.md) convenience and flexibility, allowing borrowers to make purchases and pay for them later. [Credit](../c/credit.md) cards often come with additional benefits such as rewards programs, [travel insurance](../t/travel_insurance.md), and [fraud](../f/fraud.md) protection. However, they can also carry high-[interest](../i/interest.md) rates, particularly if the balance is not paid in full each month.

### Personal Lines of Credit

A personal line of [credit](../c/credit.md) is a revolving [loan](../l/loan.md) that allows individuals to borrow [money](../m/money.md) on a needed [basis](../b/basis.md), up to a certain limit. These lines may require [collateral](../c/collateral.md), such as a [home](../h/home.md) or other assets, which could make them lower-[risk](../r/risk.md) and lower-[interest](../i/interest.md) compared to [credit](../c/credit.md) cards.

### Business Lines of Credit

[Business](../b/business.md) lines of [credit](../c/credit.md) function similarly to personal lines of [credit](../c/credit.md) but are designed specifically for [business](../b/business.md) needs. They provide companies with a flexible source of funds to cover operational expenses, manage [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md), and take advantage of opportunities as they arise.

### Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOC)

A HELOC is secured by the [equity](../e/equity.md) in the borrower’s [home](../h/home.md). It offers a revolving source of funds, often with better [interest](../i/interest.md) rates due to the secured nature of the [credit](../c/credit.md). Borrowers can use HELOCs for various purposes, including [home](../h/home.md) improvements, education costs, or [debt consolidation](../d/debt_consolidation.md).

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Revolving Credit

### Advantages

1. **Flexibility**: Borrowers can use funds as needed and repay at their convenience.
2. **Continuous Access to Funds**: [Credit](../c/credit.md) becomes available again as the balance is repaid.
3. **[Interest](../i/interest.md) on Used Amount**: [Interest](../i/interest.md) is charged only on the borrowed funds, not the entire [credit limit](../c/credit_limit.md).
4. **Various Forms**: Available in different forms, catering to personal and [business](../b/business.md) needs.

### Disadvantages

1. **High-[Interest](../i/interest.md) Rates**: Can carry high-[interest](../i/interest.md) rates, especially [credit](../c/credit.md) cards, if balances are not paid in full.
2. **Temptation to Overborrow**: Easy access to [credit](../c/credit.md) can lead to excessive borrowing and [debt](../d/debt.md) accumulation.
3. **Fees and Penalties**: May include annual fees, late [payment](../p/payment.md) fees, and penalties for exceeding the [credit limit](../c/credit_limit.md).
4. **Variable [Interest](../i/interest.md) Rates**: Some revolving [credit](../c/credit.md) accounts come with variable [interest](../i/interest.md) rates that can increase over time.

## Credit Score Impact

Revolving [credit](../c/credit.md) can significantly impact a borrower’s [credit score](../c/credit_score.md). On the positive side, responsible use of revolving [credit](../c/credit.md), such as keeping balances low and making on-time payments, can help to build and maintain a strong [credit](../c/credit.md) history. Conversely, high balances, late payments, or maxing out revolving [credit](../c/credit.md) accounts can hurt [credit](../c/credit.md) scores.

### Credit Utilization Ratio

The [credit](../c/credit.md) utilization ratio, the amount of [credit](../c/credit.md) used compared to the [credit limit](../c/credit_limit.md), is a critical [factor](../f/factor.md) in [credit](../c/credit.md) scoring. A low utilization ratio (under 30% of total available [credit](../c/credit.md)) is generally viewed positively, while a high ratio can negatively impact [credit](../c/credit.md) scores.

## Interest Calculation on Revolving Credit

[Interest](../i/interest.md) on revolving [credit](../c/credit.md) is typically calculated using the [average daily balance method](../a/average_daily_balance_method.md). Here's how it works:

1. The daily balance is calculated by adding any new charges to the previous day’s balance and subtracting any payments or credits received.
2. The daily balances are summed up over the [billing cycle](../b/billing_cycle.md).
3. The average daily balance is determined by dividing this sum by the number of days in the [billing cycle](../b/billing_cycle.md).
4. The [periodic interest rate](../p/periodic_interest_rate.md) (annual [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) divided by the number of billing periods) is then applied to the average daily balance to determine the [interest](../i/interest.md) for the [billing cycle](../b/billing_cycle.md).

## Managing Revolving Credit Effectively

To manage revolving [credit](../c/credit.md) effectively, borrowers should consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Terms and Conditions**: Be aware of the [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, fees, and [repayment](../r/repayment.md) terms associated with the [credit](../c/credit.md).
2. **Pay More Than the Minimum**: Aim to pay more than the minimum [payment](../p/payment.md) to reduce the balance more quickly and lower [interest](../i/interest.md) charges.
3. **Monitor [Credit](../c/credit.md) Utilization**: Keep the [credit](../c/credit.md) utilization ratio low to help maintain a positive [credit score](../c/credit_score.md).
4. **Regular Payments**: Make payments on time to avoid late fees and negative [credit score](../c/credit_score.md) impacts.
5. **Avoid Unnecessary Borrowing**: Only use revolving [credit](../c/credit.md) for essential needs and emergencies, not for discretionary spending.

## Regulatory Considerations

Revolving [credit](../c/credit.md) is subject to various regulations designed to protect consumers. Key regulations include:

### Truth in Lending Act (TILA)

The TILA requires lenders to provide clear and transparent information about the terms and costs of [credit](../c/credit.md), including [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, fees, and [repayment](../r/repayment.md) terms. It ensures that borrowers understand what they are agreeing to when they [open](../o/open.md) a revolving [credit](../c/credit.md) account.

### Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act

The CARD Act introduces several protective measures for [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) users:

1. **Rate Hike Restrictions**: Limits when a [credit card](../c/credit_card.md) [issuer](../i/issuer.md) can increase [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.
2. **[Fee](../f/fee.md) Limitations**: Caps certain fees, such as over-the-limit and late fees.
3. **[Payment](../p/payment.md) Allocation**: Stipulates that payments above the minimum must be applied to the highest-[interest](../i/interest.md) balances first.

### Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA)

The ECOA prohibits discrimination in the issuance of [credit](../c/credit.md) based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, or because an individual receives public assistance. This ensures fair access to revolving [credit](../c/credit.md) products.

## Conclusion

Revolving [credit](../c/credit.md) is an essential financial tool that offers flexibility and continuous access to funds. While it has significant advantages, such as convenience and flexibility, it also requires careful management to avoid pitfalls like high-[interest](../i/interest.md) rates and [debt](../d/debt.md) accumulation. Understanding the key characteristics, types, advantages, and potential drawbacks of revolving [credit](../c/credit.md) can help borrowers make informed decisions and use this financial resource effectively.

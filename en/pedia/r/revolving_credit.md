# Revolving Credit

Revolving credit is a type of credit that does not have a fixed number of payments, in contrast to installment credit. Borrowing in this manner allows consumers and businesses to continuously access funds up to a predetermined limit, repaying the borrowed amount, and drawing from it again as needed. This flexibility and convenience make revolving credit a popular choice for managing cash flow, both for personal finances and business operations. It's often linked with credit cards, but it also applies to lines of credit and other financial instruments.

## How Revolving Credit Works

When a revolving credit account is opened, the lender (usually a bank or credit union) sets a credit limit, which is the maximum amount that can be borrowed at any time. The borrower can then draw funds from the account as long as they do not exceed the credit limit. Each month, the borrower is required to make a minimum payment, which is typically a percentage of the outstanding balance. As they repay the borrowed funds, the available credit amount is replenished, allowing the borrower to use it again.

The interest is charged based on the outstanding balance and not the credit limit. This means that borrowers only pay interest on the amount they have actually used, not on the entire credit limit available to them.

## Key Characteristics of Revolving Credit

1. **Credit Limit**: The maximum amount of credit available to the borrower.
2. **Flexible Repayment**: Borrowers can choose to repay the full amount owed or make a minimum payment.
3. **Interest Rates**: Interest is charged on the outstanding balance, not the total credit limit.
4. **Renewable Use**: As balance is paid down, credit becomes available again.
5. **Account Maintenance Fees**: Some revolving credit accounts may have annual or monthly maintenance fees.

## Types of Revolving Credit

### Credit Cards

Credit cards are the most common type of revolving credit. They offer convenience and flexibility, allowing borrowers to make purchases and pay for them later. Credit cards often come with additional benefits such as rewards programs, travel insurance, and fraud protection. However, they can also carry high-interest rates, particularly if the balance is not paid in full each month.

### Personal Lines of Credit

A personal line of credit is a revolving loan that allows individuals to borrow money on a needed basis, up to a certain limit. These lines may require collateral, such as a home or other assets, which could make them lower-risk and lower-interest compared to credit cards.

### Business Lines of Credit

Business lines of credit function similarly to personal lines of credit but are designed specifically for business needs. They provide companies with a flexible source of funds to cover operational expenses, manage cash flow, and take advantage of opportunities as they arise.

### Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOC)

A HELOC is secured by the equity in the borrower’s home. It offers a revolving source of funds, often with better interest rates due to the secured nature of the credit. Borrowers can use HELOCs for various purposes, including home improvements, education costs, or debt consolidation.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Revolving Credit

### Advantages

1. **Flexibility**: Borrowers can use funds as needed and repay at their convenience.
2. **Continuous Access to Funds**: Credit becomes available again as the balance is repaid.
3. **Interest on Used Amount**: Interest is charged only on the borrowed funds, not the entire credit limit.
4. **Various Forms**: Available in different forms, catering to personal and business needs.

### Disadvantages

1. **High-Interest Rates**: Can carry high-interest rates, especially credit cards, if balances are not paid in full.
2. **Temptation to Overborrow**: Easy access to credit can lead to excessive borrowing and debt accumulation.
3. **Fees and Penalties**: May include annual fees, late payment fees, and penalties for exceeding the credit limit.
4. **Variable Interest Rates**: Some revolving credit accounts come with variable interest rates that can increase over time.

## Credit Score Impact

Revolving credit can significantly impact a borrower’s credit score. On the positive side, responsible use of revolving credit, such as keeping balances low and making on-time payments, can help to build and maintain a strong credit history. Conversely, high balances, late payments, or maxing out revolving credit accounts can hurt credit scores.

### Credit Utilization Ratio

The credit utilization ratio, the amount of credit used compared to the credit limit, is a critical factor in credit scoring. A low utilization ratio (under 30% of total available credit) is generally viewed positively, while a high ratio can negatively impact credit scores.

## Interest Calculation on Revolving Credit

Interest on revolving credit is typically calculated using the average daily balance method. Here's how it works:

1. The daily balance is calculated by adding any new charges to the previous day’s balance and subtracting any payments or credits received.
2. The daily balances are summed up over the billing cycle.
3. The average daily balance is determined by dividing this sum by the number of days in the billing cycle.
4. The periodic interest rate (annual interest rate divided by the number of billing periods) is then applied to the average daily balance to determine the interest for the billing cycle.

## Managing Revolving Credit Effectively

To manage revolving credit effectively, borrowers should consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Terms and Conditions**: Be aware of the interest rates, fees, and repayment terms associated with the credit.
2. **Pay More Than the Minimum**: Aim to pay more than the minimum payment to reduce the balance more quickly and lower interest charges.
3. **Monitor Credit Utilization**: Keep the credit utilization ratio low to help maintain a positive credit score.
4. **Regular Payments**: Make payments on time to avoid late fees and negative credit score impacts.
5. **Avoid Unnecessary Borrowing**: Only use revolving credit for essential needs and emergencies, not for discretionary spending.

## Regulatory Considerations

Revolving credit is subject to various regulations designed to protect consumers. Key regulations include:

### Truth in Lending Act (TILA)

The TILA requires lenders to provide clear and transparent information about the terms and costs of credit, including interest rates, fees, and repayment terms. It ensures that borrowers understand what they are agreeing to when they open a revolving credit account.

### Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act

The CARD Act introduces several protective measures for credit card users:

1. **Rate Hike Restrictions**: Limits when a credit card issuer can increase interest rates.

3. **Payment Allocation**: Stipulates that payments above the minimum must be applied to the highest-interest balances first.

### Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA)

The ECOA prohibits discrimination in the issuance of credit based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, or because an individual receives public assistance. This ensures fair access to revolving credit products.

# Russell 3000 Index

The Russell 3000 [Index](../i/index.md) is a [market](../m/market.md)-[capitalization](../c/capitalization.md)-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) [equity](../e/equity.md) [index](../i/index.md) that provides a comprehensive representation of the entire United States [stock market](../s/stock_market.md). The [index](../i/index.md) measures the performance of the 3,000 largest publicly traded companies in the United States, which together represent approximately 98% of the investable U.S. [equity market](../e/equity_market.md). Given its broad [scope](../s/scope.md), the Russell 3000 [Index](../i/index.md) serves as a foundational [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for investors wishing to gauge the general [market](../m/market.md) performance of U.S. [stocks](../s/stock.md).

## Components and Structure

The Russell 3000 [Index](../i/index.md) is divided into two sub-indices:
1. **[Russell 1000 Index](../r/russell_1000_index.md)**: This subset includes the 1,000 largest companies by [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md), representing approximately 92% of the Russell 3000 [Index](../i/index.md)'s total [market](../m/market.md) cap.
2. **[Russell 2000 Index](../r/russell_2000_index.md)**: Comprising the remaining 2,000 smaller companies, the [Russell 2000 Index](../r/russell_2000_index.md) represents about 8% of the total [market](../m/market.md) cap of the Russell 3000 [Index](../i/index.md).

### Market Capitalization Weighting

The Russell 3000 [Index](../i/index.md) uses [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) weighting, meaning each company's weight in the [index](../i/index.md) is proportional to its [market](../m/market.md) cap relative to the total [market](../m/market.md) cap of all companies in the [index](../i/index.md). This weighting approach ensures that larger companies have a more significant impact on the [index](../i/index.md)'s performance than smaller companies.

## Eligibility Criteria

### Market Capitalization
To be included in the Russell 3000 [Index](../i/index.md), a company's [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) must fall within the 3,000 largest publicly traded companies in the U.S. [Market](../m/market.md) cap is calculated as the stock price multiplied by the total number of outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md).

### Trading Volume
Companies must meet minimum [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) requirements, typically measured by average daily trading [volume](../v/volume.md). This criterion ensures that the companies included in the [index](../i/index.md) can be easily traded.

### Free Float Adjustment
The [index](../i/index.md) includes only the free-[float](../f/float.md) [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md), which excludes [shares](../s/shares.md) that are closely held by insiders, founders, or the government. This adjustment reflects the portion of [shares](../s/shares.md) readily available for trading.

## Importance and Uses

### Benchmark for Mutual Funds and ETFs
The Russell 3000 [Index](../i/index.md) serves as a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for a significant number of mutual funds and [exchange](../e/exchange.md)-traded funds (ETFs). Investors frequently use these investment vehicles to [gain](../g/gain.md) diversified exposure to the U.S. [equity market](../e/equity_market.md).

### Performance Measurement
Given its broad representation of the U.S. [equity market](../e/equity_market.md), the Russell 3000 [Index](../i/index.md) is widely used to measure the performance of investment portfolios. Comparing a portfolio's returns against the Russell 3000 [Index](../i/index.md) can provide insights into how well the portfolio is performing relative to the [market](../m/market.md).

### Market Sentiment Indicator
As a comprehensive gauge of the U.S. [equity market](../e/equity_market.md), the Russell 3000 [Index](../i/index.md) is often used as an [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of overall [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md). A rising [index](../i/index.md) generally suggests a bullish [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md), while a falling [index](../i/index.md) may indicate bearish sentiment.

## Annual Reconstitution

One unique aspect of the Russell 3000 [Index](../i/index.md) is its annual reconstitution. Every June, the [index](../i/index.md) is rebalanced to reflect changes in the [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) of its constituent companies. This process involves adding new companies that have grown in [market](../m/market.md) cap to be among the top 3,000 and removing those that no longer meet the criteria.

### Impact of Reconstitution
The reconstitution event can lead to significant trading activity as [index](../i/index.md) funds and ETFs adjust their [holdings](../h/holdings.md) to reflect the new composition of the [index](../i/index.md). This [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) can also have a noticeable impact on the stock prices of companies being added or removed from the [index](../i/index.md).

## Historical Performance

The Russell 3000 [Index](../i/index.md) has generally shown [robust](../r/robust.md) performance over the long term, reflecting the growth of the U.S. [economy](../e/economy.md). Since its inception in 1984, the [index](../i/index.md) has experienced several periods of both gains and declines, often mirroring [economic cycles](../e/economic_cycles.md), technological advances, and major geopolitical events.

### Long-Term Trends
Over [multiple](../m/multiple.md) decades, the Russell 3000 [Index](../i/index.md) has trended upward, driven by [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md), corporate [earnings](../e/earnings.md), and innovation. This long-term growth makes it a valuable tool for investors with a long-term [investment horizon](../i/investment_horizon.md).

### Short-Term Volatility
Like all [equity](../e/equity.md) indices, the Russell 3000 [Index](../i/index.md) is subject to short-term [volatility](../v/volatility.md). Economic reports, [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) changes, and global events can cause fluctuations in the [index](../i/index.md)'s [value](../v/value.md).

## Future Outlook

As the U.S. [economy](../e/economy.md) continues to evolve, the composition and performance of the Russell 3000 [Index](../i/index.md) are likely to change. Emerging industries, technological advancements, and demographic shifts [will](../w/will.md) play crucial roles in shaping the future landscape of the [index](../i/index.md).

### Potential Trends
1. **Technology and Innovation**: Sectors such as technology, biotechnology, and renewable energy are likely to become more prominent within the [index](../i/index.md).
2. **Sustainability**: As environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria become increasingly important to investors, companies with strong ESG practices may [gain](../g/gain.md) greater representation in the [index](../i/index.md).
3. **Economic Shifts**: Changes in the U.S. [economy](../e/economy.md), such as shifts in consumer behavior and [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) trends, [will](../w/will.md) influence the [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) of [index](../i/index.md) constituents.

## Conclusion

The Russell 3000 [Index](../i/index.md) is a fundamental tool for investors seeking broad exposure to the U.S. [equity market](../e/equity_market.md). Its comprehensive nature, annual reconstitution, and [market](../m/market.md)-cap-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) methodology make it a reliable [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for performance measurement and [market sentiment analysis](../m/market_sentiment_analysis.md). As the investment landscape continues to evolve, the Russell 3000 [Index](../i/index.md) [will](../w/will.md) remain a critical reference point for both individual and institutional investors.

# Revenue

In the context of [business](../b/business.md) and [finance](../f/finance.md), revenue—often referred to as sales or [turnover](../t/turnover.md)—is the total [income](../i/income.md) generated by the [sale](../s/sale.md) of goods or services related to the company's primary operations. Revenue is a crucial metric for [business](../b/business.md) performance as it directly indicates the company's ability to generate [income](../i/income.md) from its day-to-day operations. This topic lies at the intersection of [accounting](../a/accounting.md), [economics](../e/economics.md), [finance](../f/finance.md), and [strategic management](../s/strategic_management.md).

# Range

In [finance](../f/finance.md) and trading, the term "range" holds significant importance and is used to describe a variety of key concepts across the field. Broadly, the range is a measure of the difference between the high and low prices over a specified period of time. This simple yet crucial metric finds applications in [multiple](../m/multiple.md) facets of trading, from [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) to [algorithmic trading strategies](../a/algorithmic_trading_strategies.md). This document aims to explore the concept of range in detail, shedding light on its various uses, measurement techniques, and the insights it offers into [market](../m/market.md) behavior.

## Definition and Calculation

At its most basic, the range is calculated as:

```
Range = High Price - Low Price
```

For instance, if a stock had a high price of $150 and a low price of $130 during a trading day, its range for that day would be $20.

The range can be applied to different time frames—daily, weekly, monthly, etc.—depending on the analysis being performed. 

## Types of Range in Trading

### 1. **Daily Range**
The Daily Range refers to the difference between the highest and lowest price of a [security](../s/security.md) within a single trading day. This is one of the most commonly used metrics, especially in [day trading](../d/day_trading.md) where short-term price movements are crucial.

### 2. **Average True Range (ATR)**
Developed by J. Welles Wilder, the [Average True Range](../a/average_true_range_(atr).md) is a metric that provides a more detailed picture by considering [volatility](../v/volatility.md). Unlike simple range, ATR considers [gaps](../g/gap.md) in price and is calculated over a specified number of periods, usually 14.

```
Formula for True Range (TR):
TR = max[(High - Low), abs(High - Close_prev), abs(Low - Close_prev)]

Formula for ATR:
ATR = (Previous ATR * (n-1) + Current TR) / n
```

### 3. **Weekly/Monthly Range**
These ranges are calculated similarly to the daily range but over a week or month. These longer-term ranges help in understanding the overall [trend](../t/trend.md) and [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) over a longer period, which can be beneficial for investors with a longer-term outlook.

### 4. **Range Bars**
Range bars are a type of chart used in [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) where each bar represents a specified price range rather than a time interval. This can be particularly useful in volatile markets.

## Uses of Range in Trading

### Identifying Volatility
Range is a direct measure of [volatility](../v/volatility.md); higher ranges usually indicate higher [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and vice versa. Traders often look at the range to gauge [market](../m/market.md) conditions. For instance, in highly volatile markets, large daily ranges are common. 

### Breakout Strategies
Ranges can help identify potential [breakout](../b/breakout.md) points. If a [security](../s/security.md) has been trading within a narrow range, a [breakout](../b/breakout.md) above or below this range could signal a significant price move. Traders employ this in strategies like the [Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_band.md), where price movement beyond the bands indicates a likely [breakout](../b/breakout.md).

### Range-Bound Trading
In range-bound markets, securities [trade](../t/trade.md) within a defined upper and lower boundary. Traders use the range to identify [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels, executing buying and selling decisions accordingly. 

### Algorithmic Trading
Ranges are essential in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) for developing strategies that execute trades based on price movements within specified ranges. Detailed range analysis can help algorithms predict price movements and make timely trades.

## Advanced Tools and Indicators

### Bollinger Bands
Developed by John Bollinger, [Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_band.md) consist of a middle moving average and two outer bands which are standard deviations away from the middle band. They are used to identify range-bound trading opportunities and potential breakouts.

### Keltner Channels
These also use [volatility](../v/volatility.md) measures to create bands around a moving average, but use ATR for this purpose rather than [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md).

### Parabolic SAR
Developed by J. Welles Wilder, the Parabolic Stop and Reverse (SAR) [indicator](../i/indicator.md) uses range to determine where to place stop-losses in a trending [market](../m/market.md).

## Practical Applications

### Risk Management
Range analysis is indispensable for [risk management](../r/risk_management.md). Understanding the typical range of an [asset](../a/asset.md) helps in setting appropriate stop-loss levels, ensuring trades are exited before incurring substantial losses.

### Position Sizing
The [Average True Range](../a/average_true_range_(atr).md) is often used in [position sizing](../p/position_sizing.md) models. For instance, a [trader](../t/trader.md) might decide to [hold](../h/hold.md) positions such that their potential loss on any given [trade](../t/trade.md) does not exceed a certain percentage of the ATR.

### Trading Algorithms and Automated Systems
Algorithms can be designed to [trade](../t/trade.md) based on range [expansion](../e/expansion.md) or contraction. For example, algorithms could be programmed to enter trades when the range expands, indicating increased [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and potential price movement.

### Statistical Arbitrage
In statistical [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), range can be used as a parameter to identify pairs of securities that deviate from their expected range. When the range exceeds a certain threshold, positions can be taken to exploit the expected convergence.

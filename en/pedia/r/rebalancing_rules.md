# Rebalancing Rules

Rebalancing is a crucial concept in the domain of investment [portfolio management](../p/portfolio_management.md) and [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). It involves adjusting the weights of assets within a portfolio to maintain a desired level of [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) or risk. This activity ensures that the portfolio remains aligned with the investor's target allocation, strategy, and risk tolerance over time.

## Why Rebalancing is Important

### Control of Risk
Asset prices are subject to fluctuation. Over time, these fluctuations can cause a portfolio to deviate significantly from its target allocation. For example, if equities are performing exceptionally well compared to bonds, an equity-heavy portfolio might become riskier than intended. Rebalancing helps in controlling such unintended risks by restoring the target allocation.

### Performance Improvement
Though rebalancing primarily aims at risk control, it can also potentially enhance long-term performance. By systematically selling high and buying low, rebalancing can capture gains from market volatility.

### Behavioral Discipline
Rebalancing imposes a disciplined approach to investment and keeps emotional decisions at bay. It encourages buying underperforming assets and selling outperforming ones, countering the common investor behavior of panic-selling during market declines and overbuying during market peaks.

## Types of Rebalancing Rules

### Periodic Rebalancing
Periodic rebalancing involves adjusting the portfolio at regular intervals, such as monthly, quarterly, or annually. This method is straightforward and predictable, making it easier for investors to plan.

### Threshold-Based Rebalancing
Threshold-based rebalancing, also known as tolerance band, triggers portfolio adjustments when asset weights deviate by a certain percentage from their target. For instance, if an asset class deviates by more than 5% from its target allocation, rebalancing is initiated.

### Hybrid Rebalancing
Hybrid rebalancing combines periodic and threshold-based techniques. Portfolios are reviewed at regular intervals, and rebalancing occurs if the assets have deviated beyond set thresholds.

### Dynamic Rebalancing
Dynamic rebalancing involves continuous monitoring and can be executed using [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) strategies that automatically adjust the portfolio based on real-time data.

## Steps Involved in Rebalancing

1. **Assess Current Allocation**: Review the current weights of assets in the portfolio.
2. **Compare with Target Allocation**: Identify the differences between current weights and target weights.
3. **Calculate Required Adjustments**: Determine the trades needed to realign the portfolio with its target allocation.
4. **Implement Adjustments**: Execute the required trades to buy or sell assets.
5. **Review and Iterate**: Periodically review the portfolio to ensure it remains in line with the set objectives.

## Rebalancing Strategies in Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) utilizes automated systems to execute [rebalancing strategies](../r/rebalancing_strategies.md) efficiently and with precision. Below are a few common strategies:

### Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO)
[Mean-variance optimization](../m/mean-variance_optimization.md) aims to maximize returns for a given level of risk or minimize risk for a given return level. Developed by Harry Markowitz, this strategy calculates the optimal asset weights that should be held in a portfolio. Algorithms can use MVO to dynamically adjust portfolios.

### Risk Parity
[Risk parity](../r/risk_parity.md) focuses on equalizing the risk contribution from each asset class in a portfolio. Helps in constructing a balanced portfolio where risk, rather than capital, is evenly spread across assets.

### Minimum Variance Portfolio
The minimum variance portfolio strategy targets constructing a portfolio with the lowest possible risk. Algorithms calculate the weightings that minimize overall portfolio volatility.

## Challenges in Rebalancing

### Transaction Costs
Frequent rebalancing incurs transaction costs that can erode portfolio returns. Strategies must balance the trade-off between maintaining target allocation and minimizing costs.

### Tax Implications
In taxable accounts, selling assets to rebalance can trigger capital gains taxes. Tax-efficient [rebalancing strategies](../r/rebalancing_strategies.md) involve considering the tax impact and potentially using tax-loss harvesting to offset gains.

### Market Impact
Large trades necessary for rebalancing can affect market prices, especially for illiquid assets. Algorithms must be designed to minimize the market impact of trades.

# Restricted Stock Unit (RSU)

[Restricted Stock](../r/restricted_stock.md) Units (RSUs) are a type of compensation offered by an employer to employees in the form of company [shares](../s/shares.md). RSUs are used widely by public companies as part of their executive and employee compensation packages. Unlike stock [options](../o/options.md), RSUs come with restrictions, which typically include a [vesting](../v/vesting.md) schedule that must be met before the employee can claim ownership of the [shares](../s/shares.md). This article provides a comprehensive overview of RSUs, their working mechanism, advantages and disadvantages, tax implications, and [comparative analysis](../c/comparative_analysis.md) with other stock-based compensation forms. 

## Introduction to RSUs

RSUs are essentially a promise by the employer to [grant](../g/grant.md) [shares](../s/shares.md) to the employee at a future date, subject to specific [vesting](../v/vesting.md) conditions. These conditions could be based on the employee's [duration](../d/duration.md) of employment, company performance, or individual [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md). RSUs do not carry voting rights or entitlement to dividends until the [vesting](../v/vesting.md) conditions are met and the [shares](../s/shares.md) are issued to the employee.

## Mechanism of RSUs

### Grant Date

The [grant](../g/grant.md) date is when the company formally awards RSUs to the employee. The number of units granted, terms of the award, and the [vesting](../v/vesting.md) schedule are specified at this point.

### Vesting Schedule

The [vesting](../v/vesting.md) schedule outlines the conditions that must be satisfied before the employee can take ownership of the [shares](../s/shares.md). Common [vesting](../v/vesting.md) schedules include:

- **Time-Based [Vesting](../v/vesting.md)**: [Shares](../s/shares.md) are vested over a period, for example, four years with 25% of the [shares](../s/shares.md) [vesting](../v/vesting.md) each year.
- **Performance-Based [Vesting](../v/vesting.md)**: [Shares](../s/shares.md) vest once certain company or individual [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md) are met.
- **Cliff [Vesting](../v/vesting.md)**: All [shares](../s/shares.md) vest at a single point in time, typically after a few years.

### Delivery of Shares

Once the [vesting](../v/vesting.md) conditions are satisfied, the [shares](../s/shares.md) are delivered to the employee. At this point, the employee becomes the owner of the [shares](../s/shares.md) and can [hold](../h/hold.md), sell, or transfer them as desired, subject to any company-imposed trading restrictions.

### Forfeiture

If the employee leaves the company before the RSUs are [fully vested](../f/fully_vested.md), the unvested [shares](../s/shares.md) are typically forfeited unless otherwise specified by the company's policies.

## Advantages of RSUs

- **No Initial Cost to Employees**: Unlike stock [options](../o/options.md), where employees may need to purchase the stock at the [exercise price](../e/excersise_price.md), RSUs are granted without requiring upfront [payment](../p/payment.md).
- **Guaranteed [Value](../v/value.md)**: RSUs always have some [value](../v/value.md) as long as the company's stock holds some [value](../v/value.md), unlike stock [options](../o/options.md), which may be worthless if the stock price is below the [exercise price](../e/excersise_price.md).
- **Alignment with [Shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) Interests**: RSUs encourage employees to think and act like shareholders since their compensation is directly tied to the company's stock performance.

## Disadvantages of RSUs

- **Tax Consequences**: RSUs are subject to [income tax](../i/income_tax.md) upon [vesting](../v/vesting.md), which could lead to significant [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md) if a substantial number of [shares](../s/shares.md) vest at once.
- **No Dividends until [Vesting](../v/vesting.md)**: Employees do not receive dividends or other stockholder benefits until the [shares](../s/shares.md) vest.
- **Forfeiture [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: Unvested [shares](../s/shares.md) may be forfeited if the employee leaves the company or fails to meet performance targets.

## Tax Implications of RSUs

The [taxation](../t/taxation.md) of RSUs can be complex and varies by jurisdiction, but here is a general overview:

### Ordinary Income Tax

At the time the RSUs vest, the [value](../v/value.md) of the vested [shares](../s/shares.md) is considered [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md) and is subject to [income tax](../i/income_tax.md). The amount of [income](../i/income.md) is usually the fair [market value](../m/market_value.md) of the [shares](../s/shares.md) on the [vesting](../v/vesting.md) date.

### Capital Gains Tax

After the [shares](../s/shares.md) are vested and delivered, any additional gains from selling the [shares](../s/shares.md) are subject to [capital gains tax](../c/capital_gains_tax.md). The [holding period](../h/holding_period.md) for [capital](../c/capital.md) gains starts on the [vesting](../v/vesting.md) date.

### Withholding Tax

Employers typically withhold a portion of the [shares](../s/shares.md) to cover the employee's [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md) at the time of [vesting](../v/vesting.md). This can be done through sell-to-cover or net share settlement methods.

## RSUs vs. Other Stock-Based Compensation

### RSUs vs. Stock Options

- **No [Exercise](../e/exercise.md) Needed**: RSUs do not require [exercise](../e/exercise.md), eliminating the need for employees to purchase the [shares](../s/shares.md).
- **[Intrinsic Value](../i/intrinsic_value.md)**: RSUs have [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) as long as the stock has [value](../v/value.md), whereas [options](../o/options.md) may become worthless if the stock price falls below the [exercise price](../e/excersise_price.md).

### RSUs vs. Phantom Stocks

- **Actual Ownership**: RSUs result in actual stock ownership upon [vesting](../v/vesting.md), whereas phantom [stocks](../s/stock.md) are essentially cash bonuses mimicking stock performance.
- **Voting Rights**: RSUs provide eventual voting rights and dividends, unlike phantom [stocks](../s/stock.md).

## Real-World Examples

### Amazon.com, Inc.

Amazon utilizes RSUs extensively as part of their compensation strategy. More details can be found on Amazon's [investor relations](../i/investor_relations.md) page [here](https://www.amazon.com/ir).

### Microsoft Corporation

Microsoft also grants RSUs to its employees, and specifics can be accessed on their official page [here](https://www.microsoft.com/investor).

## Conclusion

RSUs are a powerful tool for employee compensation, closely linking the interests of employees and shareholders. They come with a clear set of advantages, making them an attractive option for both employers and employees. However, it is important to consider the potential tax implications and other risks involved, ensuring that both the company and its employees fully understand the mechanics and consequences of such awards.

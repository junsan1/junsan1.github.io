# Renko Chart

Renko charts are a type of financial chart developed by the Japanese that are used to track the price movements of assets. Unlike traditional candlestick or bar charts that record an asset’s price movement over specified periods of time, Renko charts focus exclusively on price changes. They are constructed by drawing a series of bricks or boxes, which represent a fixed price move.

## Key Features

1. **Price Movement Focused**: Renko charts are constructed based on price movements rather than time intervals. Each brick is drawn when the price surpasses a predetermined amount, irrespective of the elapsed time.
   
2. **Simplified Noise**: By not featuring minor price fluctuations, Renko charts offer a simpler view of the market, making it easy to identify significant trends.

3. **No Time Axis**: Unlike traditional charts, the horizontal axis on a Renko chart does not represent a consistent time interval. This means that a single Renko brick can represent a variable amount of time, depending on how quickly the price moves.

## How Renko Charts are Constructed

Renko charts are constructed by placing a brick in the next column once the price surpasses the top or bottom of the previous brick by a pre-determined amount. If the brick size is set to $10, a new brick will be drawn if the price moves $10 above or below the last brick's closing price.

### Brick Size

The size of the bricks can be determined in different ways:

1. **Fixed Size**: A specific numeric value is predetermined by the trader.
2. **ATR-Based**: Using the Average True Range (ATR), which adjusts the brick size based on the asset’s volatility.

### Construction Method

1. Choose the asset (e.g., stock, commodity, cryptocurrency).
2. Determine the brick size.
3. Start from a known price point. When the price moves up or down by the amount of the brick size, a new brick is added at a 45-degree angle. If the price increases, an upward/green (or white) brick is added. If the price decreases, a downward/red (or black) brick is added.
4. Continue adding bricks for subsequent price movements following the same rules.

## Benefits of Renko Charts

1. **Trend Identification**: Easier to identify the overall trend, as Renko charts filter out small fluctuations and emphasize significant price changes.
   
2. **Reduced Noise**: By focusing on significant price changes, Renko charts remove much of the noise that can be found in other types of charts.

3. **Clearer Signals**: Simplified signals for trend reversals, making it easier to implement trading strategies.
 
4. **Support and Resistance Levels**: Potentially more straightforward identification of support and resistance levels.

## Drawbacks of Renko Charts

1. **Lagging Indicator**: Due to their construction nature, Renko charts can lag in quickly changing markets.
   
2. **No Volume**: Renko charts do not display volume data, which can be an important aspect of trading analysis.

3. **Customization**: The choice of brick size significantly impacts the chart’s utility. Too small, and it becomes noisy; too large, and it may miss important details.

## Comparison with Other Chart Types

### Candlestick Charts

Candlestick charts display price movement over specific time periods, showing the opening, high, low, and closing prices. They provide rich information but can be noisy.

### Bar Charts

Bar charts are similar to candlestick charts but represent the opening, high, low, and closing prices for a time period with vertical bars. 

In comparison:

- **Renko Charts**: Focus exclusively on significant price movements, reducing noise.
- **Candlestick/Bar Charts**: Offer more detailed price action within specific time periods, which can be either an advantage or a distraction.

## Applications in Algorithmic Trading

Renko charts are particularly useful in algorithmic trading, where precision and clarity in the identification of trends are paramount. Algorithms can be designed to trigger trades based on Renko signals, making them ideal for automated trading systems.

### Strategy Design

1. **Trend Following**: Algorithms might enter a trade when a new brick forms in the direction of the trend.
2. **Breakout Strategies**: Algorithms could be designed to identify and trade breakouts by observing the formation of new bricks breaking past significant price levels.
3. **Mean Reversion**: Identifying overbought or oversold conditions when the number of consecutive bricks in one direction suggests an imminent reversal.

### Risk Management

- **Stop-Loss and Take-Profit**: Automated systems can set stop-loss and take-profit orders based on the renko brick size.
- **Volatility Adjustments**: Using ATR to adjust brick sizes can help in dynamically managing risk in volatile markets.

# Renko Chart

Renko charts are a type of financial chart developed by the Japanese that are used to track the price movements of assets. Unlike traditional [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) or bar charts that record an [asset](../a/asset.md)’s price movement over specified periods of time, Renko charts focus exclusively on price changes. They are constructed by drawing a series of bricks or boxes, which represent a fixed price move.

## Key Features

1. **Price Movement Focused**: Renko charts are constructed based on price movements rather than time intervals. Each brick is drawn when the price surpasses a predetermined amount, irrespective of the elapsed time.
   
2. **Simplified [Noise](../n/noise.md)**: By not featuring minor price fluctuations, Renko charts [offer](../o/offer.md) a simpler view of the [market](../m/market.md), making it easy to identify significant trends.

3. **No Time Axis**: Unlike traditional charts, the horizontal axis on a Renko chart does not represent a consistent time interval. This means that a single Renko brick can represent a variable amount of time, depending on how quickly the price moves.

## How Renko Charts are Constructed

Renko charts are constructed by placing a brick in the next column once the price surpasses the top or bottom of the previous brick by a pre-determined amount. If the brick size is set to $10, a new brick [will](../w/will.md) be drawn if the price moves $10 above or below the last brick's closing price.

### Brick Size

The size of the bricks can be determined in different ways:

1. **Fixed Size**: A specific numeric [value](../v/value.md) is predetermined by the [trader](../t/trader.md).
2. **ATR-Based**: Using the [Average True Range](../a/average_true_range_(atr).md) (ATR), which adjusts the brick size based on the [asset](../a/asset.md)’s [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

### Construction Method

1. Choose the [asset](../a/asset.md) (e.g., stock, [commodity](../c/commodity.md), cryptocurrency).
2. Determine the brick size.
3. Start from a known price point. When the price moves up or down by the amount of the brick size, a new brick is added at a 45-degree angle. If the price increases, an upward/green (or white) brick is added. If the price decreases, a downward/red (or black) brick is added.
4. Continue adding bricks for subsequent price movements following the same rules.

## Benefits of Renko Charts

1. **[Trend](../t/trend.md) Identification**: Easier to identify the overall [trend](../t/trend.md), as Renko charts filter out small fluctuations and emphasize significant price changes.
   
2. **Reduced [Noise](../n/noise.md)**: By focusing on significant price changes, Renko charts remove much of the [noise](../n/noise.md) that can be found in other types of charts.

3. **Clearer Signals**: Simplified signals for [trend](../t/trend.md) reversals, making it easier to implement [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).
 
4. **[Support and Resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) Levels**: Potentially more straightforward identification of [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels.

## Drawbacks of Renko Charts

1. **[Lagging Indicator](../l/lagging_indicator.md)**: Due to their construction nature, Renko charts can lag in quickly changing markets.
   
2. **No [Volume](../v/volume.md)**: Renko charts do not display [volume](../v/volume.md) data, which can be an important aspect of trading analysis.

3. **Customization**: The choice of brick size significantly impacts the chart’s [utility](../u/utility.md). Too small, and it becomes noisy; too large, and it may miss important details.

## Comparison with Other Chart Types

### Candlestick Charts

[Candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) charts display price movement over specific time periods, showing the opening, high, low, and closing prices. They provide rich information but can be noisy.

### Bar Charts

Bar charts are similar to [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) charts but represent the opening, high, low, and closing prices for a time period with vertical bars. 

In comparison:

- **Renko Charts**: Focus exclusively on significant price movements, reducing [noise](../n/noise.md).
- **[Candlestick](../c/candlestick.md)/Bar Charts**: [Offer](../o/offer.md) more detailed [price action](../p/price_action.md) within specific time periods, which can be either an advantage or a distraction.

## Applications in Algorithmic Trading

Renko charts are particularly useful in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), where precision and clarity in the identification of trends are paramount. Algorithms can be designed to trigger trades based on Renko signals, making them ideal for [automated trading systems](../a/automated_trading_systems.md).

### Strategy Design

1. **[Trend Following](../t/trend_following.md)**: Algorithms might enter a [trade](../t/trade.md) when a new brick forms in the direction of the [trend](../t/trend.md).
2. **[Breakout](../b/breakout.md) Strategies**: Algorithms could be designed to identify and [trade](../t/trade.md) breakouts by observing the formation of new bricks breaking past significant price levels.
3. **[Mean Reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md)**: Identifying [overbought](../o/overbought.md) or [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions when the number of consecutive bricks in one direction suggests an imminent [reversal](../r/reversal.md).

### Risk Management

- **Stop-Loss and Take-[Profit](../p/profit.md)**: Automated systems can set stop-loss and take-[profit](../p/profit.md) orders based on the renko brick size.
- **[Volatility](../v/volatility.md) Adjustments**: Using ATR to adjust brick sizes can help in dynamically managing [risk](../r/risk.md) in volatile markets.

## Renko Chart Tools and Platforms

Several trading platforms and software [offer](../o/offer.md) built-in support for Renko charts, facilitating traders and developers in integrating these charts into their [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

- **[TradingView](../t/tradingview.md)**: [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com) provides Renko charting tools along with script-based [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) capabilities.
- **MetaTrader 4/5**: Renko charts can be added to MetaTrader platforms via custom indicators.
- **[NinjaTrader](../n/ninjatrader.md)**: [NinjaTrader](https://ninjatrader.com) incorporates Renko charting [options](../o/options.md) and advanced [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) development capabilities.
- **Thinkorswim**: The Thinkorswim platform from TD [Ameritrade](../a/ameritrade.md) also supports Renko charting.

## Conclusion

Renko charts provide a unique approach to charting price movements by focusing solely on substantial price changes while filtering out the [noise](../n/noise.md) of minor fluctuations. This makes them an invaluable tool for traders, both manual and algorithmic, allowing for simpler, more transparent, and potentially more effective [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). By understanding and effectively utilizing Renko charts, traders can [gain](../g/gain.md) clearer insights into [market](../m/market.md) trends and more precise entry and exit signals, enhancing their overall [trading performance](../t/trading_performance.md).

The Russell 1000 [Index](../i/index.md) is a stock [market index](../m/market_index.md) that tracks the performance of the largest 1,000 publicly traded companies in the United States. It is one of the most widely used benchmarks for [large-cap stocks](../l/large_cap_stocks.md), and it provides a valuable data set for investors, analysts, and financial professionals in their assessments of the [market](../m/market.md) and individual company performances. This comprehensive overview [will](../w/will.md) cover various aspects of the Russell 1000 [Index](../i/index.md), including its history, methodology, composition, significance, and usage in the world of [finance](../f/finance.md) and trading.

## History of the Russell 1000 Index

The Russell 1000 [Index](../i/index.md) was created by the Frank Russell Company in 1984. The Frank Russell Company, now part of [FTSE Russell](../f/ftse_russell.md), designed the [index](../i/index.md) to provide a clearer and more representational gauge of large-cap stock performance in the American [equity market](../e/equity_market.md). [FTSE Russell](../f/ftse_russell.md) is a global provider of benchmarks, analytics, and data solutions for investors worldwide.

## Methodology

### Selection Criteria

The Russell 1000 [Index](../i/index.md) includes the 1,000 largest companies in the U.S. [equity](../e/equity.md) markets, which are selected based on their [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md). The selection and weighting process occurs annually, usually in May and June, during what's known as the "Russell Reconstitution."

### Market Capitalization

[Market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) is calculated as the share price multiplied by the number of outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md). Companies that rank within the largest 1,000 by [market](../m/market.md) cap are selected for inclusion.

### Weighting

The Russell 1000 [Index](../i/index.md) is a [market](../m/market.md)-[capitalization](../c/capitalization.md)-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) [index](../i/index.md), meaning each company's weight in the [index](../i/index.md) is proportional to its [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md). Larger companies have a more significant impact on the [index](../i/index.md)'s performance compared to smaller ones.

### Adjustments and Reconstitution

[FTSE Russell](../f/ftse_russell.md) conducts a reconstitution of its indexes annually to ensure they reflect [market](../m/market.md) changes accurately.

Adjustments are also made for events like mergers, acquisitions, and initial public offerings (IPOs).

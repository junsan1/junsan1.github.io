# Requisition in Financial and Trading Contexts

Requisition in financial and trading contexts refers to a formal request or demand for something, typically an order or purchase. The term is broadly used across different sectors within finance and trading, and it can encompass multiple processes depending on the specific context. Here, requisition can involve stock orders, procurement of financial instruments, or even internal requests within financial institutions. Understanding its multidimensional applications helps in navigating the complexities of financial operations.

## Stock Requisition

In the stock market, requisition refers to the formal process by which traders, investors, or institutional clients place requests for purchasing or selling stocks. This involves several steps, from the initiation of the order to its execution.

1. **Order Placement**: The requisition process starts with the trader or investor placing an order with their broker. This can be done through online trading platforms, directly through phone orders, or via instructions given in trading algorithms.

2. **Order Processing**: Once the order is received, it is processed by the broker who then forwards it to the stock exchange for execution. This stage may involve various checks and validations to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.

3. **Execution and Confirmation**: The order is executed on the stock exchange, and the confirmation is sent back to the broker and subsequently to the trader or investor. This concludes the requisition cycle.

## Requisition in Procurement

In financial institutions, requisition is often used in the context of procurement of goods and services. Large financial institutions frequently require specialized services, technology solutions, or physical commodities, and requisition forms part of the procurement cycle.

1. **Need Identification**: The process begins with identifying the need for a particular good or service. This is often formalized through an internal requisition which specifies the requirements and justifies the need.

2. **Approval Process**: The requisition is then forwarded for approval to relevant authorities within the organization. This step involves budget checks, compliance verification, and approval from upper management.

3. **Supplier Engagement**: Upon approval, the procurement team engages with suppliers through Request for Proposal (RFP) or Request for Quotation (RFQ) processes. Vendors provide their bids, and the best fit is selected after evaluations.

4. **Order Placement and Delivery**: The formal purchase order is issued to the chosen supplier, and upon acceptance, the delivery process is initiated. Often, financial institutions employ technology platforms to streamline these stages.

## Financial Instruments Requisition

Requisition in the context of financial instruments refers to the formal request to acquire or dispose of various financial products, including bonds, derivatives, mutual funds, etc.

1. **Instrument Selection**: Investors or portfolio managers determine the need to add or remove a financial instrument based on their investment strategy or changing market conditions.

2. **Research and Analysis**: This stage involves detailed research and analysis of the selected instruments considering factors like risk, return, market trends, and regulatory impacts.

3. **Formal Request Submission**: A formal requisition is then submitted through designated channels in the financial institution. This may involve filling out detailed forms and providing necessary documentation.

4. **Execution and Portfolio Adjustment**: Upon approval, the order is executed either through direct market interactions or via internal trading desks. Post-execution, necessary adjustments are made in the portfolios.

## Internal Requisition Processes

In financial organizations, internal requisition processes are crucial for departments to function efficiently. These requisitions can range from operational needs to strategic initiatives.

1. **Operational Requisitions**: Everyday operational requisitions include requests for office supplies, IT equipment, maintenance services, etc. These are typically managed through an internal requisition system or enterprise resource planning (ERP) tools.

2. **Strategic Requisitions**: For projects that require substantial resources or new capabilities, strategic requisitions are raised. Examples include introducing new trading platforms, expanding research departments, or undertaking new financial modeling initiatives.

3. **Approval Workflow**: Both operational and strategic requisitions follow an approval workflow involving multiple levels of authorizations. This ensures proper resource allocation and adherence to budget constraints.

4. **Implementation**: Once approved, the requisition is processed, and the required resources are allocated to the requesting department. Periodic reviews are conducted to assess the efficiency and outcomes of these requisitioned resources.

## Technology and Requisition Processes

With advancements in FinTech, the requisition processes in financial and trading contexts have become more streamlined and efficient. Technologies play a significant role in enhancing the speed, accuracy, and transparency of requisitions.

1. **Automated Trading Systems**: In algorithmic trading, requisition processes are automated through pre-defined algorithms that execute buy/sell orders based on market conditions. This reduces the manual intervention and speeds up trade execution.

2. **Blockchain for Requisition Tracking**: Blockchain technology offers an immutable ledger for tracking requisition processes, especially in procurement. It ensures transparency, reduces fraud, and enhances trust among stakeholders.

3. **ERP and CRM Systems**: Modern ERP and CRM systems integrate requisition workflows, enabling seamless operation across financial institutions. These systems support everything from initial requisition generation to final execution and reporting.

4. **AI and Machine Learning**: AI and Machine Learning technologies aid in predictive analysis, helping financial organizations make informed requisition decisions. AI models can forecast the demand for particular instruments, optimize procurement processes, and predict market movements.

## Conclusion

Requisition in financial and trading contexts is a multifaceted process encompassing various activities from stock orders to internal departmental needs. The common thread across all types of requisitions is the need for formal requests, approval processes, and execution mechanisms. In modern finance, the adoption of technology has significantly enhanced the efficiency and effectiveness of requisition processes, allowing organizations to operate seamlessly and maintain competitive advantages.

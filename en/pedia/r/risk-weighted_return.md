# Risk-Weighted Return

Risk-Weighted Return is a financial metric that adjusts the returns of an investment by the amount of risk taken to achieve those returns. This metric helps investors understand the efficiency of their investment strategy by comparing the returns to the potential risks involved. It is particularly important in the context of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) (often referred to as "algo-trading" or "automated trading"), where complex [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) are executed using computers and [quantitative models](../q/quantitative_models.md).

## Key Concepts

### Risk-Weighted Return

At its core, Risk-Weighted Return considers the variance or volatility of returns and adjusts the [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md) accordingly. Higher volatility implies higher risk; hence, a high return with high uncertainty may not be as attractive as a lower but stable return.

### Importance in Algo-Trading

In the realm of algo-trading, the use of sophisticated algorithms for making trading decisions involves substantial risk, primarily because these are based on historical data and models which may not always predict future movements accurately. Risk-Weighted Return helps in choosing algorithms and strategies that provide optimal performance with controlled risk.

### Common Metrics

Several specific ratios and measurements assess Risk-Weighted Returns, each with its own method of factoring in risk:

1. **[Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md)**
2. **[Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md)**
3. **Treynor Ratio**
4. **[Information Ratio](../i/information_ratio.md)**

## Sharpe Ratio

Developed by Nobel Laureate William F. Sharpe, the [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) is one of the most widely used measures of risk-weighted performance. It is calculated by dividing the difference between the portfolio return and the risk-free rate by the standard deviation of the portfolio returns.

### Calculation

\[ Sharpe\ Ratio = \frac{E(R) - R_f}{\sigma} \]

- \( E(R) \) = Expected return of the portfolio
- \( R_f \) = Risk-free rate
- \( \sigma \) = Standard deviation of the portfolio returns

### Interpretation

A higher [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) indicates better [risk-adjusted return](../r/risk-adjusted_return.md). A negative [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) suggests that a risk-free investment would perform better than the observed strategy.

## Sortino Ratio

The [Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md) is similar to the [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) but differentiates between harmful volatility (downside risk) and total volatility. It uses the standard deviation of the negative asset returns ([downside deviation](../d/downside_deviation.md)) rather than the standard deviation of all returns.

### Calculation

\[ Sortino\ Ratio = \frac{E(R) - R_f}{DD} \]

- \( E(R) \) = Expected return of the portfolio
- \( R_f \) = Risk-free rate
- \( DD \) = [Downside deviation](../d/downside_deviation.md)

### Interpretation

The [Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md) provides a more accurate measure of an investmentâ€™s [risk-adjusted return](../r/risk-adjusted_return.md) by focusing on the downside risk, making it particularly useful for evaluating investments expected to have significant downside volatility.

## Treynor Ratio

Named after Jack L. Treynor, the Treynor Ratio measures returns earned in excess of those that could have been earned on a risk-free investment per each unit of market risk. Unlike the [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md), which uses standard deviation as the risk measure, the Treynor Ratio uses beta.

### Calculation

\[ Treynor\ Ratio = \frac{E(R) - R_f}{\beta} \]

- \( E(R) \) = Expected return of the portfolio
- \( R_f \) = Risk-free rate
- \( \beta \) = Beta of the portfolio

### Interpretation

A higher Treynor Ratio indicates that the investment has provided a higher return per unit of market risk.

## Information Ratio

The [Information Ratio](../i/information_ratio.md) measures portfolio returns beyond the returns of a benchmark, usually an index, compared to the volatility of those returns.

### Calculation

\[ Information\ Ratio = \frac{E(R_p - R_b)}{\sigma} \]

- \( E(R_p) \) = Expected return of the portfolio
- \( E(R_b) \) = Expected return of the benchmark
- \( \sigma \) = Standard deviation of the difference in returns

### Interpretation

A higher [Information Ratio](../i/information_ratio.md) suggests that the portfolio manager has a higher level of skill, as they are able to generate excess returns with higher consistency.

## Companies Utilizing Risk-Weighted Return in Algo-Trading

### Two Sigma Investments [Link](https://www.twosigma.com/)

Two Sigma uses machine learning, distributed computing, and other sophisticated technologies to find connections in global markets. They heavily rely on risk-weighted return metrics to optimize their [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

### Renaissance Technologies [Link](https://www.rentec.com/)

Renaissance Technologies, known for their Medallion Fund, employs complex mathematical models and algorithms to exploit market inefficiencies, continually adjusting for risk-to-return ratios to maintain their competitive edge.

### AQR Capital Management [Link](https://www.aqr.com/)

AQR Capital Management leverages [quantitative analysis](../q/quantitative_analysis.md) to manage risk and optimize returns. They utilize risk-weighted return metrics extensively in their multi-strategy investment approach.

### Citadel [Link](https://www.citadel.com/)

Citadel applies rigorous research and technology-driven strategies to manage a broad range of asset classes and investment strategies. These strategies often incorporate risk-weighted returns to ensure alignment with investment objectives.

## Application in Portfolio Management

Risk-weighted return metrics are crucial in [portfolio optimization](../p/portfolio_optimization.md), helping investors choose a mix of assets that offer the best return for the level of risk they are willing to take.

### Example

Consider a portfolio manager evaluating two investment opportunities: 

1. **Investment A** has an expected return of 10% with a standard deviation of 15%.
2. **Investment B** has an expected return of 8% with a standard deviation of 8%.

If the risk-free rate is 2%, the Sharpe Ratios would be:

- \( Sharpe\ Ratio_A = \frac{10\% - 2\%}{15\%} = 0.53 \)
- \( Sharpe\ Ratio_B = \frac{8\% - 2\%}{8\%} = 0.75 \)

Though Investment A offers higher returns, Investment B is more attractive on a risk-adjusted basis.

## Conclusion

Risk-weighted return is an invaluable concept in the world of investments, particularly in algo-trading. It allows for a more nuanced view of performance, considering not just the returns but also the risks taken to achieve them. By employing metrics like Sharpe, Sortino, and Treynor Ratios, investors and fund managers can make more informed decisions, optimizing their strategies to balance potential rewards with corresponding risks.

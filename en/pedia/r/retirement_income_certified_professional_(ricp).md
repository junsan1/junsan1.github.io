## Introduction
The Retirement [Income](../i/income.md) Certified Professional (RICP) is a professional designation offered by The American College of Financial Services.

## History and Relevance
The concept of retirement [income](../i/income.md) planning has gained prominence in recent years, especially as demographic patterns shift and people live longer.

The RICP designation was introduced to address this need, providing specialized training and education to financial professionals.

# Relative Value Models

**Introduction**

In the complex world of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), an array of sophisticated models helps investors make informed decisions. One such model that has seen a significant rise in popularity is the [Relative Value](../r/relative_value.md) Model. These models are employed to identify mispricings between related financial instruments, often leveraging [statistics](../s/statistics.md) and algorithms to exploit discrepancies for [profit](../p/profit.md). In this document, we [will](../w/will.md) delve into the intricacies of [Relative Value](../r/relative_value.md) Models, examining their [underlying](../u/underlying.md) principles, methodologies, applications, and examples of real-world usage.

**Understanding [Relative Value](../r/relative_value.md) Models**

[Relative value](../r/relative_value.md) trading involves comparing the prices of two or more related financial instruments to identify opportunities for [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) or hedging. The core idea is that related instruments should exhibit a certain degree of price [correlation](../c/correlation.md). When these instruments deviate from their expected relationship, traders can [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on this temporary mispricing.

1. **Basics of [Relative Value](../r/relative_value.md):**
    - **Concept**: At its simplest, [relative value](../r/relative_value.md) trading aims to [profit](../p/profit.md) from temporal discrepancies in prices that should theoretically be closely aligned.
    - **Mathematical Foundation**: Often, statistical measures such as [z-scores](../z/z-scores_in_trading.md), [correlation](../c/correlation.md) coefficients, and regression analyses are employed to gauge the relationship between instruments.

2. **Common [Relative Value](../r/relative_value.md) Strategies:**
    - **[Pairs Trading](../p/pairs_trading.md)**: Involves two [stocks](../s/stock.md) or other financial instruments expected to maintain a specific price relationship. Traders buy the underperforming instrument and short the overperforming one.
    - **Statistical [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**: Utilizes large-scale data analysis and algorithms to identify small, temporary disparities in a large basket of [stocks](../s/stock.md) or other instruments.
    - **[Convergence Trading](../c/convergence_trading.md)**: Involves instruments expected to converge in price over time, often based on fundamental or economic similarities.

**Methodologies in [Relative Value](../r/relative_value.md) Models**

[Relative value](../r/relative_value.md) methodologies can be categorized into several types based on their analytical approach and complexity.

1. **Historical Price Relationships:**
    - **[Mean Reversion](../m/mean_reversion.md)**: Assumes prices [will](../w/will.md) revert to a historical mean over time. Models use past price data to predict future price movements.
    - **Cointegration**: Focuses on identifying pairs or sets of instruments whose prices move together in the long term, even if they deviate in the short term.

2. **[Regression Analysis](../r/regression_analysis.md):**
    - **[Linear Regression](../l/linear_regression.md)**: Fits a [linear relationship](../l/linear_relationship.md) between the prices of two instruments. Traders monitor the residuals (differences) from the model to identify mispricings.
    - **Multivariate Regression**: Extends the concept to [multiple](../m/multiple.md) instruments, [offering](../o/offering.md) a more sophisticated view of price relationships.

3. **Statistical Measures:**
    - **[Correlation Coefficient](../c/correlation_coefficient.md)**: Quantifies the degree to which two instruments move in relation to each other.
    - **[Z-scores](../z/z-scores_in_trading.md)**: Measures how far an instrumentâ€™s price deviates from its average in terms of standard deviations.

4. **Machine [Learning Algorithms](../l/learning_algorithms_in_trading.md):**
    - **[Support Vector Machines](../s/support_vector_machines_in_trading.md) (SVM)**: Can be used for classification and regression, aiding in identifying non-linear relationships.
    - **[Neural Networks](../n/neural_networks_in_trading.md)**: Capable of recognizing complex patterns in large datasets, making them suitable for high-frequency [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

**Applications of [Relative Value](../r/relative_value.md) Models**

1. **[Equity](../e/equity.md) Markets:**
    - **[Pairs Trading](../p/pairs_trading.md)**: Often used within sectors where [stocks](../s/stock.md) are believed to exhibit similar economic sensitivities.
    - **[Sector Rotation](../s/sector_rotation.md)**: Involves rotating investments between sectors based on [relative value](../r/relative_value.md) assessments.

2. **[Fixed Income](../f/fixed_income.md):**
    - **[Yield Curve](../y/yield_curve.md) [Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)**: Exploits mispricings along the [yield curve](../y/yield_curve.md) by comparing short-term and long-term [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.
    - **[Credit Spread](../c/credit_spread.md) Trades**: Focuses on mispricings between different [debt](../d/debt.md) instruments or [credit](../c/credit.md) ratings.

3. **Commodities and FX Markets:**
    - **[Commodity](../c/commodity.md) [Spreads](../s/spreads.md)**: Trades differences between related commodities (e.g., WTI vs. Brent Crude).
    - **[Relative Value](../r/relative_value.md) in FX**: Involves [currency](../c/currency.md) pairs with expected correlations due to economic ties.

4. **[Derivatives](../d/derivatives.md):**
    - **Option Pricing Discrepancies**: Uses [option pricing models](../o/option_pricing_models.md) to find mispricings between [options](../o/options.md) of similar strikes, maturities, or [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets.

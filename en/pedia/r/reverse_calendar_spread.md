# Reverse Calendar Spread

A Reverse Calendar Spread, also known as a reverse time spread or contra-calendar spread, is an advanced [options](../o/options.md) [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) that serves as a speculative play on [volatility](../v/volatility.md). Unlike a traditional calendar spread, where an [investor](../i/investor.md) typically buys a longer-term option and sells a shorter-term option of the same type and [strike price](../s/strike_price.md), the reverse calendar spread involves selling a longer-term option and buying a shorter-term option.

### Mechanics of a Reverse Calendar Spread

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of how one can set up a reverse calendar spread:

1. **Selection of Strike Prices and [Options](../o/options.md)**: Identify the [asset](../a/asset.md) you want to [trade](../t/trade.md). Choose an appropriate [strike price](../s/strike_price.md). For the [options](../o/options.md), choose one with a nearer [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md) and another with a longer-term [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md).
2. **[Execution](../e/execution.md)**:
   - **Sell** a longer-term option (either call or put).
   - **Buy** a shorter-term option with the same [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) as the longer-term option.
3. **Objective**: This strategy aims to [profit](../p/profit.md) from the differential decay of [time value](../t/time_value.md) ([theta](../t/theta.md)) between the short-term and long-term [options](../o/options.md). Additionally, it can [profit](../p/profit.md) if the [volatility](../v/volatility.md) decreases by more for the longer-term option than the shorter-term one.

### Key Components

- **[Underlying Asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)**: The [security](../s/security.md) or [index](../i/index.md) that the [options](../o/options.md) are based on.
- **Expiration Dates**: The short-term option [will](../w/will.md) have a closer [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md), whereas the long-term option [will](../w/will.md) have a farther [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md).
- **[Strike Price](../s/strike_price.md)**: Both [options](../o/options.md) [will](../w/will.md) share the same [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).

### Example

Suppose you are trading [options](../o/options.md) on a stock currently priced at $100. To set up a reverse calendar spread:
- You sell a [call option](../c/call_option.md) expiring in three months with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $100.
- You buy a [call option](../c/call_option.md) expiring in one month with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $100.

Let's assume:
- The longer-term [call option](../c/call_option.md) (three months out) can be sold for $5.
- The shorter-term [call option](../c/call_option.md) (one month out) can be bought for $2.

Here's the initial outlook:
- You receive $5 from selling the longer-term call.
- You pay $2 for buying the shorter-term call.
- Your net [credit](../c/credit.md) is $3.

### Profit and Loss (P&L) Dynamics

- **Maximum [Gain](../g/gain.md)**: The ideal scenario for a reverse calendar spread is when the stock price is at the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) at the expiration of the short-term option. Here, the short-term option expires worthless, and you still have the [premium](../p/premium.md) from the long-term option. Essentially, maximum [gain](../g/gain.md) occurs when the decay of the short-term option outruns that of the long-term option.
- **Maximum Loss**: Involves the scenario where the price of the [asset](../a/asset.md) moves significantly in either direction. In such cases, the [trader](../t/trader.md) could face significant losses as the longer-term option still holds significant [time value](../t/time_value.md) while the shorter-term option provides insufficient coverage.
- **Break-even Points**: The exact break-even points [will](../w/will.md) depend on the premiums paid and received. Generally, they are calculated as the stock price at which the net [gain](../g/gain.md)/loss is zero at the expiration of the short-term option.

### Advantages

- **[Volatility](../v/volatility.md) Play**: Ideal for scenarios where the [trader](../t/trader.md) expects a drop in [volatility](../v/volatility.md).
- **Net [Credit](../c/credit.md)**: Immediate [credit](../c/credit.md) received from the [trade](../t/trade.md) as opposed to paying a [debit](../d/debit.md) in a regular calendar spread.

### Disadvantages

- **[Unlimited Risk](../u/unlimited_risk.md)**: Potentially [unlimited risk](../u/unlimited_risk.md) as [asset](../a/asset.md) price moves away from the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).
- **[Margin](../m/margin.md) Requirements**: Often requires substantial [margin](../m/margin.md) due to the [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with selling a longer-term option.

### Risk Management Strategies

- **[Delta Hedging](../d/delta_hedging.md)**: To minimize directional [risk](../r/risk.md), traders can employ [delta](../d/delta.md)-[neutral](../n/neutral.md) strategies.
- **[Volatility](../v/volatility.md) Hedging**: Utilizing [VIX options](../v/vix_option.md) or other [volatility](../v/volatility.md) instruments to manage the exposure to changes in [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

### Use Cases in Trading

- **[Volatility](../v/volatility.md) Predictions**: Traders anticipating a significant decrease in [volatility](../v/volatility.md) might find this a [lucrative](../l/lucrative.md) strategy.
- **[Earnings Announcements](../e/earnings_announcements.md)**: Before [earnings](../e/earnings.md) where there's expected to be a drop in implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md) post-announcement, reverse calendar [spreads](../s/spreads.md) can be useful.

### Important Considerations

1. **Implied [Volatility](../v/volatility.md) (IV)**: Critical to understand the relationship between the IV of shorter-term and longer-term [options](../o/options.md).
2. **[Time Decay](../t/time_decay.md) ([Theta](../t/theta.md))**: Gotta track [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) as it impacts both [options](../o/options.md) differently.
3. **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)**: Ensuring the chosen [options](../o/options.md) have enough [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) to enter and exit positions effectively.

### Example Companies Utilizing Reverse Calendar Spread

Many [proprietary trading](../p/proprietary_trading.md) firms and [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds might utilize this strategy as part of their [portfolio management](../p/portfolio_management.md) and speculative trading practices:

- **Jane Street**: A [quantitative trading](../q/quantitative_trading.md) [firm](../f/firm.md) that leverages various sophisticated [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), including [options](../o/options.md). They often apply strategies like reverse calendar [spreads](../s/spreads.md) in their [market](../m/market.md)-making activities. [Jane Street](https://www.janestreet.com/)

- **Citadel Securities**: Known for their high-frequency trading and [options](../o/options.md) [market](../m/market.md)-making, Citadel's extensive use of both traditional and complex [options](../o/options.md) strategies could very well encompass the use of reverse calendar [spreads](../s/spreads.md). [Citadel Securities](https://www.citadelsecurities.com/)

### Conclusion

The reverse calendar spread is a nuanced [options](../o/options.md) [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) that offers a speculative play on [volatility](../v/volatility.md). Its unique structure of leveraging the differential [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) between short-term and long-term [options](../o/options.md) makes it an intricate, yet potentially rewarding approach for experienced traders. As with any sophisticated [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md), thorough understanding and careful [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) are paramount to successfully employing this strategy.

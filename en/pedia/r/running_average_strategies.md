# Running Average Strategies

Running average strategies, often referred to as moving average strategies, are a cornerstone of algorithmic trading. These strategies incorporate moving averages into their design to help forecast future price movements based on historical data and statistical analyses. There are various forms of moving averages, each with its unique application and significance. This in-depth exploration will cover the different types of moving averages, their role in trading strategies, programming aspects, and industry applications.

## Types of Moving Averages

### Simple Moving Average (SMA)

The Simple Moving Average (SMA) is one of the most straightforward forms of moving averages. It is calculated by summing up the prices over a certain period and then dividing by that period.

**Formula**:
\[ \text{SMA}_n = \frac{P_1 + P_2 + ... + P_n}{n} \]

Where \( P \) represents the price at a given time point, and \( n \) is the time period.

### Exponential Moving Average (EMA)

The Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is a type of moving average that gives more weight to recent prices. This makes it more responsive to new information compared to the SMA.

**Formula**:
\[ \text{EMA}_t = P_t \cdot \alpha + \text{EMA}_{t-1} \cdot (1 - \alpha) \]

Where \( \alpha \) is the smoothing factor calculated as:
\[ \alpha = \frac{2}{n+1} \]

### Weighted Moving Average (WMA)

The Weighted Moving Average (WMA) assigns a different weight to each price point within the period. The most recent price gets the highest weight, and weights decrease in a linear fashion.

**Formula**:
\[ \text{WMA} = \frac{n \cdot P_1 + (n-1) \cdot P_2 + ... + 1 \cdot P_n}{\sum_{i=1}^n i} \]

### Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)

Although MACD is not a moving average per se, it is derived from the difference between the 26-period EMA and 12-period EMA. The MACD line is then contrasted with a 9-period EMA of itself to generate buy and sell signals.

**Formula**:
\[ \text{MACD} = \text{EMA}_{12} - \text{EMA}_{26} \]
\[ \text{Signal Line} = \text{EMA}_{9}(\text{MACD}) \]

## Application in Trading Strategies

### Crossover Strategy

The crossover strategy employs two moving averages: a short-term and a long-term average. A buy signal is generated when the short-term average crosses above the long-term average, and a sell signal is triggered when it crosses below.

### Moving Average Ribbon

This strategy uses multiple SMAs or EMAs to create a ribbon of moving averages. The strategy looks for points where all the moving averages begin to converge or diverge, signaling potential buy or sell opportunities.

### Moving Average Envelopes

Moving Average Envelopes place a certain percentage above and below the moving average line. Buy and sell signals are triggered when the price crosses outside these envelopes.

### Adaptive Moving Average (AMA)

Unlike traditional moving averages, the AMA adapts based on volatility and market trends. This makes it more dynamic and responsive to changing market conditions.

## Programming Moving Averages

### Python Implementation

Python is a popular language for implementing algorithmic trading strategies due to its robust libraries like pandas, NumPy, and TA-Lib.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def calculate_sma(data, period):
    return data.rolling(window=period).mean()

def calculate_ema(data, period):
    return data.ewm(span=period, adjust=False).mean()

def calculate_wma(data, period):
    weights = np.arange(1, period+1)
    return data.rolling(period).apply(lambda prices: np.dot(prices, weights)/weights.sum(), raw=True)

# Example Usage
data = pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])
sma = calculate_sma(data, 3)
ema = calculate_ema(data, 3)
wma = calculate_wma(data, 3)
```

### Backtesting

Backtesting is crucial for assessing the efficiency of moving average strategies. Libraries like Backtrader and Zipline offer robust frameworks for backtesting:

```python
import backtrader as bt

class MovingAverageStrategy(bt.SignalStrategy):
    def __init__(self):
        self.sma = bt.indicators.SimpleMovingAverage(self.data.close, period=15)
        self.ema = bt.indicators.ExponentialMovingAverage(self.data.close, period=30)
        self.cross = bt.indicators.CrossOver(self.sma, self.ema)

    def next(self):
        if self.cross > 0:  # a buy signal
            self.buy()
        elif self.cross < 0:  # a sell signal
            self.sell()

# Load data and run backtest
data = bt.feeds.YahooFinanceData(dataname='AAPL', fromdate=dt.datetime(2018, 1, 1),
                                  todate=dt.datetime(2020, 12, 31))
cerebro = bt.Cerebro()
cerebro.adddata(data)
cerebro.addstrategy(MovingAverageStrategy)
cerebro.run()
cerebro.plot()
```

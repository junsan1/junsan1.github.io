# Relative Purchasing Power Parity (RPPP)

Relative [Purchasing Power](../p/purchasing_power.md) [Parity](../p/parity.md) (RPPP) is an economic theory that describes the relationship between the [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rates of two countries and the movement of their [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates over time. The core idea of RPPP is that changes in the [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) between two countries' currencies should neutralize the effect of differences in [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rates, thereby ensuring that the [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) of the currencies remains balanced in the [long run](../l/long_run.md).

## Core Principles

### Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)

PPP is an economic theory that compares different countries' currencies through a "[basket of goods](../b/basket_of_goods.md)" approach. According to this theory, in the absence of [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md) and other barriers, the price for an identical [basket of goods](../b/basket_of_goods.md) and services in two different countries should be the same when expressed in a common [currency](../c/currency.md).

### Absolute vs. Relative PPP

- **Absolute PPP:** Asserts that the [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) between two countries [will](../w/will.md) adjust to reflect the price levels of a [basket of goods](../b/basket_of_goods.md) in those countries. For instance, if a [basket of goods](../b/basket_of_goods.md) costs $100 in the U.S. and £75 in the U.K., the [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) should be $1.33/£.
- **Relative PPP:** Focuses on the rate of change of price levels (i.e., [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rates) rather than the price levels themselves. It posits that the change in [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates over time [will](../w/will.md) be proportional to the difference in [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rates between the two countries.

## The RPPP Equation

The RPPP equation can be written as:

```markdown
(S1/S0) = (1+I_d)/(1+I_f)
```

Where:
- \( S1 \) is the future [spot exchange rate](../s/spot_exchange_rate.md),
- \( S0 \) is the current [spot exchange rate](../s/spot_exchange_rate.md),
- \( I_d \) is the domestic [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rate,
- \( I_f \) is the foreign [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rate.

This equation states that the future [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) is a function of the current [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) adjusted by the relative price levels ([inflation](../i/inflation.md) rates) in the two countries.

### Example Calculation

Suppose the current USD/EUR [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) (S0) is 1.2, the [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rate in the U.S. (I_d) is 3%, and the [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rate in the [Eurozone](../e/eurozone.md) (I_f) is 1%. The future [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) (S1) can be calculated as follows:

```markdown
S1 = 1.2 * (1+0.03)/(1+0.01) = 1.2 * 1.03/1.01 ≈ 1.2228
```

Thus, the future [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) would be approximately 1.2228 USD/EUR, assuming the [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rates remain constant.

## Assumptions of RPPP

### Market Efficiency

RPPP assumes that [foreign exchange](../f/foreign_exchange.md) markets are efficient, meaning that all available information and expectations about future [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rates are immediately factored into current [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates.

### Availability of Goods and Services

The theory assumes that goods and services are identical in different countries and that there are no changes in product qualities, specifications, or consumer preferences.

### No Transaction Costs or Barriers

RPPP relies on the assumption that there are zero [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md), tariffs, or barriers to [trade](../t/trade.md). Any such costs could affect the [parity](../p/parity.md) condition.

### Free Flow of Capital and Trade

For RPPP to [hold](../h/hold.md), [capital](../c/capital.md) and [trade](../t/trade.md) must flow freely across borders without restrictions. Any restrictions could lead to discrepancies between theoretical and actual [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates.

## Empirical Evidence and Limitations

### Short-Term vs. Long-Term Validity

Empirical studies have shown mixed results for the RPPP theory. While RPPP might [hold](../h/hold.md) true in the [long run](../l/long_run.md), various short-term factors, including [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, political instability, and [speculation](../s/speculation.md), can cause deviations from the PPP condition.

### Structural Changes

Structural changes in the [economy](../e/economy.md), like technological advancements, shifts in consumer preferences, and changes in [trade](../t/trade.md) policies, can affect the [parity](../p/parity.md) condition.

### Non-Traded Goods and Services

RPPP mainly applies to traded goods and services, but non-traded goods and services (like [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) and healthcare) can cause significant deviations.

### Time and Adjustment Lags

RPPP assumes immediate adjustments, but in reality, there can be significant time lags due to contracts, shipping times, and other frictions.

## Applications of RPPP

### Exchange Rate Forecasting

By understanding the relationship between [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rates and [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates, policymakers, and traders can make more informed decisions regarding future [currency](../c/currency.md) values.

### Investment Strategies

Investors utilize RPPP to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against [inflation](../i/inflation.md) and [currency](../c/currency.md) [risk](../r/risk.md). By diversifying portfolios and [investing](../i/investing.md) in foreign assets, investors can mitigate losses from [currency](../c/currency.md) [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) caused by [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

### Policy Formulation

Governments and central banks use RPPP to gauge the competitiveness of their currencies. Persistent deviations from RPPP could indicate potential issues like overvaluation or undervaluation of the [currency](../c/currency.md), prompting policy actions.

### Risk Management

Corporations engaged in international [trade](../t/trade.md) use RPPP as part of their [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) strategy to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against unfavorable changes in [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates due to differing [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rates.

## Criticisms of RPPP

### Ignoring Non-Economic Factors

RPPP often ignores non-economic factors like political instability, [speculation](../s/speculation.md), and [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) differentials that can influence [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates significantly.

### Incomplete Market Structures

Many markets are imperfect and have barriers like tariffs, [trade](../t/trade.md) restrictions, and [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md) that the RPPP theory does not account for.

### Dynamic Nature of Markets

Modern [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) are highly dynamic and influenced by numerous factors, including technological innovations, regulatory changes, and evolving consumer preferences, making the RPPP a simplistic model.

### Speculative Attacks

RPPP does not account for speculative attacks or [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) swings that can cause rapid and significant shifts in [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates, irrespective of [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rates.

## Conclusion

Relative [Purchasing Power](../p/purchasing_power.md) [Parity](../p/parity.md) is a fundamental economic theory that offers a framework for understanding and predicting the relationship between [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rates and [exchange](../e/exchange.md) rates over the long term. While it provides valuable insights for economists, policymakers, and investors, it is crucial to recognize its limitations and the various factors that can lead to deviations from the [parity](../p/parity.md) condition.

In practice, RPPP serves as a useful guideline rather than an absolute rule, requiring consideration of numerous external factors, [market](../m/market.md) conditions, and the dynamic nature of global economic systems.

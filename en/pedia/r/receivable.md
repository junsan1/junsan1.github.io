# Receivable

In the domain of [finance](../f/finance.md) and trading, the term "receivable" refers to the amount of [money](../m/money.md) owed to a company or an individual by its customers as a result of having delivered a product or service. This is a vital component of a company’s [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) and working [capital](../c/capital.md). Receivables are considered [current assets](../c/current_assets.md) on the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) because they are expected to be paid within one year. 

## Understanding Receivables

Receivables are created when a company allows its customers to purchase goods or services on [credit](../c/credit.md). Instead of the [customer](../c/customer.md) paying immediately in cash, the company records the amount owed as a receivable, showing the [customer](../c/customer.md)’s promise to pay at a future date. This can enhance sales by allowing customers more flexibility, but it also entails a [risk](../r/risk.md) of [default](../d/default.md).

### Types of Receivables

#### Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable (AR) are the most common type of receivables. These are the amounts that customers owe to a [business](../b/business.md) for sales on [credit](../c/credit.md). Accounts receivable are typically recorded as [current assets](../c/current_assets.md), assuming that they [will](../w/will.md) be collected within one year. Effective management of accounts receivable is essential to maintain a healthy [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md).

#### Notes Receivable

Notes receivable differ from accounts receivable in that they are supported by formal documents, or promissory notes, which include specified [payment](../p/payment.md) terms including [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and [maturity](../m/maturity.md) dates. Notes receivable can be either current or [long-term assets](../l/long-term_assets.md), depending on the due date of the [payment](../p/payment.md).

#### Interest Receivables

[Interest](../i/interest.md) receivables pertain to amounts owed to the company for [interest](../i/interest.md) [income](../i/income.md). This can arise from lending [money](../m/money.md) or from investments that generate [interest](../i/interest.md) [income](../i/income.md). 

### Managing Receivables

Effective receivable management is crucial for maintaining [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and long-term profitability. Companies use various strategies to manage their receivables, including:

#### Credit Policies

Setting stringent [credit](../c/credit.md) policies determines who can get [credit](../c/credit.md) and under what terms. [Credit](../c/credit.md) policies should be balanced to prevent both excessive [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) and overly stringent terms which might inhibit sales.

#### Credit Analysis

[Credit](../c/credit.md) analysis involves assessing a [customer](../c/customer.md)'s ability to meet their [payment](../p/payment.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md). Tools for [credit](../c/credit.md) analysis might include reviewing [credit](../c/credit.md) reports, analyzing [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md), and checking references.

#### Monitoring Receivables

Regularly monitoring the receivable accounts ensures that collections processes are timely and effective. A detailed aging report, which breaks down receivables by the length of time an [invoice](../i/invoice.md) has been outstanding, can be an invaluable tool.

#### Collections Strategy

A [robust](../r/robust.md) collections strategy includes steps to follow for overdue accounts. This might involve reminder notices, phone calls, and even legal action if necessary. Effective communication with clients is key in collections.

### Financing Receivables

Receivables [financing](../f/financing.md) is a process where a company uses its outstanding invoices or receivables as [collateral](../c/collateral.md) to obtain a [loan](../l/loan.md) or sell outright to a [third party](../t/third_party.md) for immediate cash. This can greatly enhance [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) for businesses that may have to wait a long time for [payment](../p/payment.md) from customers. There are two main types of receivables [financing](../f/financing.md):

#### Factoring

Factoring involves selling receivables to a [third party](../t/third_party.md), known as a [factor](../f/factor.md), at a [discount](../d/discount.md). The [factor](../f/factor.md) then collects the receivables and assumes the [risk](../r/risk.md) of [customer](../c/customer.md) [default](../d/default.md). This provides immediate cash to the company but at the cost of the [discount](../d/discount.md) and any fees imposed by the [factor](../f/factor.md).

#### Invoice Discounting

[Invoice](../i/invoice.md) [discounting](../d/discounting.md) is similar to factoring but does not involve the transfer of ownership of the receivables. Instead, it uses the invoices as [collateral](../c/collateral.md) against a [loan](../l/loan.md). The company continues to collect the receivables and repay the [loan](../l/loan.md). This allows the company to retain control over the [customer](../c/customer.md) relationship.

### Accounting for Receivables

Proper [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for receivables is essential. Key components include:

#### Recording Transactions

When a [sale](../s/sale.md) is made on [credit](../c/credit.md), it is recorded by debiting accounts receivable and crediting sales [revenue](../r/revenue.md). When the [customer](../c/customer.md) pays, the company debits cash and credits accounts receivable.

#### Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Companies must account for the possibility that some receivables [will](../w/will.md) not be collected. The [allowance for doubtful accounts](../a/allowance_for_doubtful_accounts.md) is a contra-[asset](../a/asset.md) account that reduces the total amount of receivables on the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) to reflect anticipated defaults.

#### Bad Debt Expense

[Bad debt expense](../b/bad_debt_expense.md) represents the cost associated with uncollectible accounts receivable. This is accounted for by estimating the amount of receivables that are expected to be uncollectible and recording it as an [expense](../e/expense.md) on the [income statement](../i/income_statement.md).

### Metrics and Analysis

#### Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)

[Days Sales Outstanding](../d/days_sales_outstanding.md) (DSO) measures the average number of days that a company takes to collect [payment](../p/payment.md) after a [sale](../s/sale.md). This metric provides insight into the [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) of the company’s collections process and its customers' [payment](../p/payment.md) habits.

Formula:
```
DSO = (Accounts Receivable / Total [Credit](../c/credit.md) Sales) * Number of Days
```

A lower DSO indicates that a company is efficient at collecting its receivables, while a higher DSO can indicate potential [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) problems or inefficiencies in the collections process.

#### Receivables Turnover Ratio

The [Receivables Turnover Ratio](../r/receivables_turnover_ratio.md) measures how often a company collects its average accounts receivable balance in a period. Higher [turnover](../t/turnover.md) suggests efficient collection processes and a high-quality [customer](../c/customer.md) base.

Formula:
```
[Receivables Turnover Ratio](../r/receivables_turnover_ratio.md) = Net [Credit](../c/credit.md) Sales / Average Accounts Receivable
```

## Conclusion

Receivables play a critical role in a company's [financial health](../f/financial_health.md), influencing [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md), profitability, and overall [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md). Effective management of receivables requires a well-defined [credit](../c/credit.md) policy, thorough [credit](../c/credit.md) analysis, consistent monitoring, and a [robust](../r/robust.md) collections strategy. [Financing](../f/financing.md) [options](../o/options.md) like factoring and [invoice](../i/invoice.md) [discounting](../d/discounting.md) can provide additional [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), while careful [accounting](../a/accounting.md) ensures accurate financial reporting and compliance. Metrics such as [Days Sales Outstanding](../d/days_sales_outstanding.md) and [Receivables Turnover Ratio](../r/receivables_turnover_ratio.md) are invaluable for assessing and improving receivables management. Understanding and optimizing the management of receivables is essential for any company looking to maintain strong [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) and [competitive advantage](../c/competitive_advantage.md).

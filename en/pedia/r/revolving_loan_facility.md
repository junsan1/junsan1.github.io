# Revolving Loan Facility

A revolving loan facility is a type of credit issued by a financial institution that provides the borrower with the flexibility to draw down, repay, and redrawn loans advanced to it. It is similar to a credit card in terms of usage: the borrower can access funds up to a certain credit limit, repay these funds, and borrow again as needed. Revolving loan facilities are frequently used by companies to manage their working capital needs because they offer a readily available source of funds on an ongoing basis.

## Key Features of Revolving Loan Facility

- **Credit Limit**: This is the maximum amount of money that the borrower can access at any given time. The credit limit is set by the lender and can be based on the borrowerâ€™s creditworthiness, business profile, and financial health.
- **Drawdown**: The borrower can draw down funds as necessary, meaning they can take out money whenever needed, up to the credit limit.
- **Repayment**: The borrower is required to make regular payments which could be interest-only or include both interest and principal. If the borrower repays more than the minimum requirement, they can re-borrow that amount again.
- **Interest Rates**: Interest on a revolving loan facility is typically variable and often linked to a benchmark rate such as the LIBOR or prime rate.
- **Fees**: These may include commitment fees, which are charged on the unused portion of the facility, and/or origination fees, which cover the administrative costs of setting up the loan.

## Types of Revolving Loan Facilities

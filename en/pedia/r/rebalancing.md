# Rebalancing

Rebalancing is a financial strategy employed to bring a portfolio back to its desired [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md). This process ensures that the investment remains aligned with the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) and investment goals over time. The concept is particularly pivotal in the fields of [investment management](../i/investment_management.md) and [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md), as it addresses the drift that occurs when different [asset](../a/asset.md) classes grow at different rates.

## Why is Rebalancing Important?

### Maintains Desired Risk Levels

One of the primary reasons for rebalancing a portfolio is to maintain the desired [risk](../r/risk.md) levels. Over time, different assets like [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, and commodities appreciate at different rates. For example, if [stocks](../s/stock.md) [outperform](../o/outperform.md) bonds, the portfolio may become overly concentrated in equities, increasing the overall [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Enhances Returns

Rebalancing can also enhance returns through a disciplined approach to buy low and sell high. By trimming appreciated assets and buying depreciated ones, investors systematically sell high-performing assets and buy those that are underperforming, potentially positioning themselves for a future rebound.

### Adheres to Investment Strategy

Consistent rebalancing helps in adhering to the initial [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md). It prevents the portfolio from being swayed by [market](../m/market.md) trends and emotional decisions, providing a structured approach to [investment management](../i/investment_management.md).

## Types of Rebalancing

Several types of [rebalancing strategies](../r/rebalancing_strategies.md) can be employed:

### Calendar Rebalancing

In calendar rebalancing, the portfolio is adjusted at predetermined intervals, such as monthly, quarterly, or annually. This method offers simplicity and predictability but may not respond promptly to significant [market](../m/market.md) movements.

### Threshold Rebalancing

Threshold rebalancing involves adjusting the portfolio when the allocation of any [asset class](../a/asset_class.md) deviates from its target by a predetermined percentage. For instance, an [investor](../i/investor.md) may decide to rebalance if the allocation to equities deviates by more than 5% from its target.

### Dynamic Rebalancing

Dynamic rebalancing is more sophisticated and involves continuous monitoring of the portfolio. This strategy aims to take advantage of [market](../m/market.md) conditions, frequently adjusting the allocations to maintain the desired balance.

## Tools and Techniques

Modern [portfolio management](../p/par.md) practices [leverage](../l/leverage.md) technology for efficient rebalancing. Several tools and techniques can aid in this process:

### Algorithmic Rebalancing

Algorithmic rebalancing utilizes computer algorithms to execute trades automatically when certain conditions are met. This approach eliminates human emotion and ensures timely [execution](../e/execution.md).

### Robo-Advisors

Robo-advisors employ algorithms to manage and rebalance portfolios automatically. Companies like Betterment (https://www.betterment.com/) and Wealthfront (https://www.wealthfront.com/) [offer](../o/offer.md) such services, providing a cost-effective solution for individual investors.

### Software and Platforms

Financial software and platforms like [Morningstar](../m/morningstar.md) Direct (https://www.[morningstar](../m/morningstar.md).com/products/direct), [Bloomberg Terminal](../b/bloomberg_terminal.md) (https://www.[bloomberg](../b/bloomberg.md).com/professional/solution/[bloomberg](../b/bloomberg.md)-terminal/), and others [offer](../o/offer.md) advanced rebalancing functionalities to institutional investors and financial advisors.

## Implementation in Different Investments

Rebalancing isn't restricted to traditional [asset](../a/asset.md) classes. It's also crucial in other investment forms:

### Mutual Funds and ETFs

Mutual funds and [exchange](../e/exchange.md)-traded funds (ETFs) may require rebalancing to maintain their stated investment objectives. [Fund](../f/fund.md) managers regularly adjust the portfolio to ensure compliance with the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md).

### Real Estate

[Real estate](../r/real_estate.md) portfolios also benefit from rebalancing. Investors might sell properties appreciating faster than the [market](../m/market.md) average and reinvest in [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) properties to maintain a balanced [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) exposure.

### Cryptocurrency

In the volatile world of cryptocurrency, rebalancing helps manage [risk](../r/risk.md) and capture profits. Platforms like Shrimpy (https://www.shrimpy.io/) [offer](../o/offer.md) automatic rebalancing for crypto portfolios.

## Tax Implications

Rebalancing can have tax implications, especially when it involves selling appreciated assets. Long-term [capital](../c/capital.md) gains are usually taxed at a lower rate than short-term gains, but it's imperative to consider the tax implications of any rebalancing strategy.

### Tax-Loss Harvesting

Tax-loss harvesting is a strategy that can be combined with rebalancing to [offset](../o/offset.md) gains with losses. By selling underperforming assets at a loss, investors can minimize their [tax liability](../t/tax_liability.md).

## Challenges and Considerations

While rebalancing is a beneficial strategy, it isn't without challenges:

### Transaction Costs

Frequent rebalancing can incur significant [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md), especially in taxable accounts. It's essential to weigh these costs against the benefits of rebalancing.

### Emotional Discipline

Rebalancing often involves selling high-performing assets and buying underperformers, which can be emotionally challenging. Adhering to a predetermined rebalancing strategy requires discipline.

### Market Timing

Some investors attempt to time the [market](../m/market.md) with rebalancing, which can be risky. The objective should be to maintain the desired allocation rather than predicting short-term [market](../m/market.md) movements.

## Conclusion

Rebalancing is a crucial aspect of [portfolio management](../p/par.md) that helps maintain the desired [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md), manage [risk](../r/risk.md), and enhance returns over time. By employing various strategies and utilizing modern tools, investors can implement an effective rebalancing plan. Understanding the tax implications and associated costs is essential for executing this strategy successfully. Whether through manual adjustments or automated solutions like robo-advisors, rebalancing remains a foundational principle in prudent [investment management](../i/investment_management.md).

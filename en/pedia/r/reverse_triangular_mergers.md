# Reverse Triangular Mergers

In the world of corporate finance and mergers, a Reverse Triangular Merger (RTM) stands out as a unique and effective strategy, particularly in the structuring of acquisitions. An RTM is used to facilitate the purchase of a target company in a way that allows the acquiring company to retain the target's legal status, contracts, and licenses, while still falling under the management and operational control of the acquirer. The process involves creating a subsidiary that merges into the target company, resulting in the target company surviving the merger and becoming a subsidiary of the acquirer. This article explores the intricate details of reverse triangular mergers, their benefits, legal implications, and strategic considerations.

## Definition and Mechanism

A Reverse Triangular Merger entails the creation of a wholly-owned subsidiary by the acquiring company. This subsidiary is then merged with the target company, while the original target company continues to exist as a subsidiary under the acquirer's umbrella. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Creation of Subsidiary**: The acquiring company incorporates a new subsidiary specifically for the merger.
2. **Subsidiary Merges with Target**: The created subsidiary merges with the target company, but instead of the target company dissolving, the subsidiary is dissolved.
3. **Target Company Survives**: Post-merger, the target company remains operational but as a subsidiary of the acquirer.
4. **Exchange of Shares**: Shareholders of the target company receive shares in the acquiring company. Consequently, the acquirer gains control of the target company's shares.

## Advantages of Reverse Triangular Mergers

RTMs offer several advantages, which make them a popular strategy in mergers and acquisitions:

### 1. **Continuity of Business Operations**
The target company maintains its operational and legal framework, reducing disruption to daily activities. This continuity is particularly beneficial for maintaining existing contracts, licenses, and permits that could be complicated or time-consuming to transfer.

### 2. **Asset and Liability Management**
By keeping the target company technically unchanged, the acquiring firm can strategically manage the assets and liabilities. This can include minimizing tax implications, preserving favorable contracts, and maintaining brand equity.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency**
Reverse Triangular Mergers can often be structured to ensure tax-efficient outcomes. The transaction can be treated as a stock-for-stock transaction under IRS guidelines, which can defer taxes for shareholders.

### 4. **Regulatory Advantages**
Certain industries with heavy regulatory oversight might benefit from RTMs as they minimize the complexities of transferring various licenses and regulatory approvals that would otherwise be required in a direct acquisition.

### 5. **Improved Acceptance**
The process can be more palatable to the target company’s shareholders since their company continues to exist, albeit under new ownership. This can facilitate a smoother negotiating process and reduce resistance.

## Legal Aspects and Considerations

### Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL)
Many RTMs are structured under Delaware law due to its business-friendly statutes. A critical provision is Section 251 of the DGCL, which sets out the requirements for mergers and requires the approval of a majority of the target company’s shareholders.

### Securities Laws 
Compliance with federal securities laws is essential. The Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 regulate the issuance of shares and require proper disclosure to protect investors and ensure transparency.

### Contractual Obligations
One must review existing contracts of the target company to ensure they do not include change-of-control clauses, which could be triggered by the merger, potentially alienating customers or suppliers.

### Antitrust Considerations
Antitrust laws, regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Department of Justice (DOJ), must be considered to ensure the merger does not create unfair market conditions or reduce competition.

### Due Diligence
Extensive due diligence is a critical step in the RTM process. It involves a thorough examination of the target company’s financials, legal standing, and operational status to identify any potential risks or liabilities.

## Strategic Considerations

### Valuation and Pricing
Proper valuation of the target company is essential to determine an equitable price for its acquisition. Comparable company analysis, precedent transactions, and discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis are common methods used.

### Financing the Merger
Financing might be required to facilitate the transaction. Companies may utilize existing cash reserves, issue new stock, or seek debt financing. The chosen method impacts the acquirer’s capital structure and needs careful consideration.

### Post-Merger Integration 
While the target company continues to exist, integration plans should be prepared to combine operational, administrative, and cultural aspects to ensure smooth functioning post-merger. This might include aligning human resources strategies, IT systems, and corporate governance practices.

## Case Studies

### VMware and NIST
One notable instance of a reverse triangular merger is VMware's acquisition of NIST using a wholly-owned subsidiary. This move allowed VMware to seamlessly integrate NIST’s technology and expertise without disrupting business operations.

### Cisco and WebEx
Another example is Cisco’s strategic acquisition of WebEx. By using a reverse triangular merger, Cisco could integrate WebEx’s web collaboration services into its lineup while maintaining existing WebEx customer contracts and operational frameworks.

## Conclusion

A reverse triangular merger provides an efficient and strategic method for acquiring a company while maintaining continuity and leveraging the target’s existing contracts and operational structure. Proper planning, thorough due diligence, and strategic integration are crucial for leveraging the benefits of such mergers. The intricate balance of legal, financial, and operational considerations makes RTMs a complex yet rewarding strategy for corporate growth and expansion.

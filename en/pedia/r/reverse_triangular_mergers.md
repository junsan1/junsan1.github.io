# Reverse Triangular Mergers

In the world of [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md) and mergers, a Reverse Triangular [Merger](../m/merger.md) (RTM) stands out as a unique and effective strategy, particularly in the structuring of acquisitions. An RTM is used to facilitate the purchase of a target company in a way that allows the acquiring company to retain the target's legal status, contracts, and licenses, while still falling under the management and operational control of the acquirer. The process involves creating a subsidiary that merges into the target company, resulting in the target company surviving the [merger](../m/merger.md) and becoming a subsidiary of the acquirer. This article explores the intricate details of reverse triangular mergers, their benefits, legal implications, and strategic considerations.

## Definition and Mechanism

A Reverse Triangular [Merger](../m/merger.md) entails the creation of a wholly-owned subsidiary by the acquiring company. This subsidiary is then merged with the target company, while the original target company continues to exist as a subsidiary under the acquirer's umbrella. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Creation of Subsidiary**: The acquiring company incorporates a new subsidiary specifically for the [merger](../m/merger.md).
2. **Subsidiary Merges with Target**: The created subsidiary merges with the target company, but instead of the target company dissolving, the subsidiary is dissolved.
3. **Target Company Survives**: Post-[merger](../m/merger.md), the target company remains operational but as a subsidiary of the acquirer.
4. **[Exchange](../e/exchange.md) of [Shares](../s/shares.md)**: Shareholders of the target company receive [shares](../s/shares.md) in the acquiring company. Consequently, the acquirer gains control of the target company's [shares](../s/shares.md).

## Advantages of Reverse Triangular Mergers

RTMs [offer](../o/offer.md) several advantages, which make them a popular strategy in mergers and acquisitions:

### 1. **Continuity of Business Operations**
The target company maintains its operational and legal framework, reducing disruption to daily activities. This continuity is particularly beneficial for maintaining existing contracts, licenses, and permits that could be complicated or time-consuming to transfer.

### 2. **Asset and Liability Management**
By keeping the target company technically [unchanged](../u/unchanged.md), the acquiring [firm](../f/firm.md) can strategically manage the assets and liabilities. This can include minimizing tax implications, preserving favorable contracts, and maintaining [brand equity](../b/brand_equity.md).

### 3. **Tax Efficiency**
Reverse Triangular Mergers can often be structured to ensure tax-efficient outcomes. The [transaction](../t/transaction.md) can be treated as a stock-for-stock [transaction](../t/transaction.md) under IRS guidelines, which can defer [taxes](../t/taxes.md) for shareholders.

### 4. **Regulatory Advantages**
Certain industries with heavy regulatory oversight might benefit from RTMs as they minimize the complexities of transferring various licenses and regulatory approvals that would otherwise be required in a direct [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md).

### 5. **Improved Acceptance**
The process can be more palatable to the target company’s shareholders since their company continues to exist, albeit under new ownership. This can facilitate a smoother negotiating process and reduce resistance.

## Legal Aspects and Considerations

### Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL)
Many RTMs are structured under Delaware law due to its [business](../b/business.md)-friendly statutes. A critical [provision](../p/provision.md) is Section 251 of the DGCL, which sets out the requirements for mergers and requires the approval of a majority of the target company’s shareholders.

### Securities Laws 
Compliance with federal securities laws is essential. The [Securities Act of 1933](../s/securities_act_of_1933.md) and the [Securities Exchange Act of 1934](../s/securities_exchange_act_of_1934.md) regulate the issuance of [shares](../s/shares.md) and require proper [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) to protect investors and ensure [transparency](../t/transparency.md).

### Contractual Obligations
One must review existing contracts of the target company to ensure they do not include change-of-control clauses, which could be triggered by the [merger](../m/merger.md), potentially alienating customers or suppliers.

### Antitrust Considerations
[Antitrust](../a/antitrust.md) laws, regulated by the Federal [Trade](../t/trade.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (FTC) and Department of Justice (DOJ), must be considered to ensure the [merger](../m/merger.md) does not create unfair [market](../m/market.md) conditions or reduce competition.

### Due Diligence
Extensive [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md) is a critical step in the RTM process. It involves a thorough examination of the target company’s financials, legal standing, and operational status to identify any potential risks or liabilities.

## Strategic Considerations

### Valuation and Pricing
Proper [valuation](../v/valuation.md) of the target company is essential to determine an equitable price for its [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md). Comparable company analysis, precedent transactions, and discounted [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) (DCF) analysis are common methods used.

### Financing the Merger
[Financing](../f/financing.md) might be required to facilitate the [transaction](../t/transaction.md). Companies may utilize existing cash reserves, [issue](../i/issue.md) new stock, or seek [debt financing](../d/debt_financing.md). The chosen method impacts the acquirer’s [capital structure](../c/capital_structure.md) and needs careful consideration.

### Post-Merger Integration 
While the target company continues to exist, integration plans should be prepared to combine operational, administrative, and cultural aspects to ensure smooth functioning post-[merger](../m/merger.md). This might include aligning human resources strategies, IT systems, and [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) practices.

## Case Studies

### VMware and NIST
One notable instance of a reverse triangular [merger](../m/merger.md) is VMware's [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) of NIST using a wholly-owned subsidiary. This move allowed VMware to seamlessly integrate NIST’s technology and expertise without disrupting [business](../b/business.md) operations.

### Cisco and WebEx
Another example is Cisco’s strategic [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) of WebEx. By using a reverse triangular [merger](../m/merger.md), Cisco could integrate WebEx’s web collaboration services into its lineup while maintaining existing WebEx [customer](../c/customer.md) contracts and operational frameworks.

## Conclusion

A reverse triangular [merger](../m/merger.md) provides an efficient and strategic method for acquiring a company while maintaining continuity and leveraging the target’s existing contracts and operational structure. Proper planning, thorough [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md), and strategic integration are crucial for leveraging the benefits of such mergers. The intricate balance of legal, financial, and operational considerations makes RTMs a complex yet rewarding strategy for corporate growth and [expansion](../e/expansion.md).

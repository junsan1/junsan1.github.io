# Regulatory Capture

Regulatory capture is a form of government failure which occurs when a regulatory agency, created to act in the public [interest](../i/interest.md), instead advances the commercial or political concerns of special [interest](../i/interest.md) groups that dominate the [industry](../i/industry.md) or sector it is charged with regulating. This can lead to a scenario where the agency acts in the [interest](../i/interest.md) of the [industry](../i/industry.md) it is supposed to oversee, rather than for the [public good](../p/public_good.md).

## Overview
Regulatory capture is a significant [issue](../i/issue.md) in the context of governance and economic regulations. It can hamper the effectiveness of regulatory policies and can often lead to an erosion of public [trust](../t/trust.md). The concept is closely linked with theories of [political economy](../p/political_economy.md) and public choice theory.

## Mechanisms of Regulatory Capture
Regulatory capture can occur through various mechanisms, including but not limited to:

### 1. **Revolving Door Syndrome**
This phenomenon occurs when individuals move between roles as regulators and members of the industries affected by regulation. The close connections developed by these individuals may bias regulatory actions. 

**Example**: A classic example involves the U.S. Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC). Critics often point out that many high-ranking officials in the SEC are former employees of major [Wall Street](../w/wall_street.md) firms.

### 2. **Industry Lobbying**
Industries often engage in intense lobbying to influence regulatory agencies and legislators. By providing political contributions, lobbying can create a favorable regulatory environment for the [industry](../i/industry.md).

**Example**: The banking [industry](../i/industry.md) in the U.S. has been known to spend millions on lobbying to influence the regulatory climate, especially in the wake of the 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md).

### 3. **Regulatory Inertia**
Regulatory agencies can become slow and resistant to change due to entrenched [bureaucracy](../b/bureaucracy.md) and established relationships with the industries they regulate. 

**Example**: In sectors like telecommunications or pharmaceuticals, regulatory agencies often take years to implement new rules or reforms, which may be due in part to their interactions with the [industry](../i/industry.md).

### 4. **Capture by Expertise**
Regulators may become reliant on the [industry](../i/industry.md)'s expertise for information and data, leading to a bias towards the [industry](../i/industry.md)'s perspective.

**Example**: This is common in highly technical industries such as biotechnology or energy, where the regulator may not have the same level of technical knowledge as the [industry](../i/industry.md).

## Historic Examples of Regulatory Capture

### 1. **The Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC)**
Established in 1887 to regulate the railroads and later trucking, the ICC is often cited as one of the earliest examples of regulatory capture. Over time, the agency became more attuned to the interests of the railroads rather than the public [interest](../i/interest.md), leading to [deregulation](../d/deregulation.md) and eventual dissolution in 1995.

### 2. **The Federal Reserve**
While not a classic case of regulatory capture, the Federal Reserve has been criticized for being too close to the banking [industry](../i/industry.md). Post-2008, critics argue that its actions primarily benefited large financial institutions rather than the broader [economy](../e/economy.md).

### 3. **Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)**
The EPA has been accused of regulatory capture, especially under various administrations. [Industry](../i/industry.md) lobbying and political pressure have sometimes led to weaker environmental regulations.

### 4. **Food and Drug Administration (FDA)**
Accusations have been leveled against the FDA regarding its relationship with pharmaceutical companies. Some argue that the agency's reliance on [industry](../i/industry.md) funding and expertise compromises its ability to regulate effectively.

## Modern-day Examples

### 1. **Financial Industry**
Post-Dodd-Frank, several instances of regulatory capture have been noted within financial regulatory agencies. The complexities of financial instruments make it challenging for regulators not to rely on the [industry](../i/industry.md) for data and analysis.

### 2. **Healthcare Industry**
Lobbying by [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies, pharmaceutical firms, and hospital groups often shapes healthcare regulations, sometimes to the detriment of public health.

### 3. **Technology Sector**
Tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Facebook spend significant amounts on lobbying efforts, leading to a perception of regulatory capture within agencies like the Federal [Trade](../t/trade.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (FTC).

## Implications and Consequences
Regulatory capture has various negative consequences, including:

### 1. **Ineffective Regulation**
When regulatory agencies are captured, regulations become less effective as they are often designed to favor [industry](../i/industry.md) interests rather than control harmful practices.

### 2. **Public Distrust**
Regulatory capture contributes to public distrust in government institutions. When people perceive that regulators act in favor of the industries they regulate, confidence in the entire regulatory framework can erode.

### 3. **Economic Inefficiencies**
Regulatory capture can lead to [market](../m/market.md) inefficiencies. When regulations are biased, they can distort competition, leading to monopolies or oligopolies.

### 4. **Increased Costs**
For consumers, regulatory capture can lead to higher costs, as regulations are more likely to favor price increases or anti-competitive practices.

## Mitigating Regulatory Capture
Several measures can be taken to mitigate the effects of regulatory capture:

### 1. **Transparency and Accountability**
Enhancing the [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and accountability of regulatory agencies can help mitigate capture. Regular audits and public [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) of interactions between regulators and [industry](../i/industry.md) representatives can make it harder for regulatory capture to occur.

### 2. **Independent Oversight**
Creating separate, independent bodies to oversee regulatory agencies can provide another layer of scrutiny. These bodies can audit, investigate, and report on regulatory activities.

### 3. **Revolving Door Restrictions**
Implementing strict guidelines on the movement of people between [industry](../i/industry.md) and regulatory agencies can reduce the [risk](../r/risk.md) of regulatory capture. Cooling-off periods and conflict-of-[interest](../i/interest.md) rules are examples of such measures.

### 4. **Public Participation**
Increasing public participation in the regulatory process can balance the influence of special [interest](../i/interest.md) groups. Public comment periods, [open](../o/open.md) hearings, and [stakeholder](../s/stakeholder.md) consultations are ways to involve more voices in the regulatory process.

### 5. **Government Ethics Laws**
Strengthening government ethics laws and ensuring that they apply rigorously to all forms of lobbying and political contributions can help minimize regulatory capture.

## Conclusion
Regulatory capture is a pervasive [issue](../i/issue.md) that undermines the effectiveness of regulation and the integrity of governmental institutions. Understanding its mechanisms and consequences can aid in developing policies to counteract it. By adopting measures like [transparency](../t/transparency.md), independent oversight, and public participation, it is possible to create a more balanced and effective regulatory environment.

# Reverse Collar Strategy

The reverse [collar](../c/collar.md) strategy is an advanced [options](../o/options.md) [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md), commonly utilized by traders seeking significant [upside potential](../u/upside_potential_in_trading.md) while limiting their potential losses. This strategy involves simultaneously buying call [options](../o/options.md) and selling [put options](../p/put_options.md) on an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), often executed when the [trader](../t/trader.md) believes the [asset](../a/asset.md) price [will](../w/will.md) move significantly but wants to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against [downside risk](../d/downside_risk.md). Below, we [will](../w/will.md) delve into how the reverse [collar](../c/collar.md) strategy works, including its structure, benefits, drawbacks, and examples for better understanding.

## 1. Structure of the Reverse Collar Strategy

The reverse [collar](../c/collar.md) strategy involves three main components executed simultaneously:

1. **Long Call [Options](../o/options.md)**: Buying call [options](../o/options.md) gives the [trader](../t/trader.md) the right to purchase the [asset](../a/asset.md) at a specified [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) before the [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md). This becomes profitable if the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price increases beyond the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) plus the [premium](../p/premium.md) paid.

2. **Short [Put Options](../p/put_options.md)**: Selling [put options](../p/put_options.md) obligates the [trader](../t/trader.md) to buy the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at a specified [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) if the buyer of the [put option](../p/put.md) decides to [exercise](../e/exercise.md) it. This generates [income](../i/income.md) in the form of premiums, which can [offset](../o/offset.md) the cost of purchasing call [options](../o/options.md).

3. **Short [Asset](../a/asset.md) Position (Optional)**: Some traders might also take a short position in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on the potential decrease in its price, although this is not a requirement for a reverse [collar](../c/collar.md) strategy.

### Example Structure

- [Underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md): Stock XYZ, currently trading at $100
- Buy 1 XYZ [Call Option](../c/call_option.md) with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $110, costing $2 per share
- Sell 1 XYZ [Put Option](../p/put.md) with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $90, earning $2 per share

In this scenario, the premiums from selling the [put options](../p/put_options.md) [offset](../o/offset.md) the cost of purchasing the call [options](../o/options.md), potentially creating a net-zero outlay or a net [credit](../c/credit.md) situation.

## 2. Benefits of the Reverse Collar Strategy

### 2.1. Upside Potential

When the [trader](../t/trader.md) buys call [options](../o/options.md), they acquire the ability to [profit](../p/profit.md) significantly from upward price movements in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). Since the [trader](../t/trader.md) controls a larger amount of the [asset](../a/asset.md) through [options](../o/options.md) than they could with the same [capital](../c/capital.md) invested directly in the [asset](../a/asset.md), the potential gains can be substantial if the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price rises above the [call option](../c/call_option.md)'s [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).

### 2.2. Limited Risk

The primary advantage of the reverse [collar](../c/collar.md) strategy is its ability to limit potential losses. The [risk](../r/risk.md) is confined to the difference between the strike prices of the [put option](../p/put.md) and the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s current price, less the [net premium](../n/net_premium.md) received from the [put option](../p/put.md). This means the maximum loss is predictable and capped, crucial for [risk management](../r/risk_management.md).

### 2.3. Cost Offset (Premium Collection)

By selling [put options](../p/put_options.md), the [trader](../t/trader.md) receives [premium](../p/premium.md) [income](../i/income.md), which can partially or fully [offset](../o/offset.md) the cost of the purchased call [options](../o/options.md). This reduces the net cost of establishing the position, effectively providing a cost-efficient way to achieve [upside](../u/upside.md) exposure.

## 3. Drawbacks of the Reverse Collar Strategy

### 3.1. Obligation to Buy the Asset

Selling [put options](../p/put_options.md) come with the obligation to purchase the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) if its price falls below the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of the [put option](../p/put.md). This can require significant [capital](../c/capital.md) or [margin](../m/margin.md) capacity, especially if the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s price drops significantly and the [options](../o/options.md) are exercised.

### 3.2. Early Assignment Risk

Traders face the [risk](../r/risk.md) of early [assignment](../a/assignment.md) when selling [put options](../p/put_options.md). If the [put options](../p/put_options.md) are exercised before their [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md), the [trader](../t/trader.md) must buy the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md). This scenario can occur especially if the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price falls sharply.

### 3.3. Limited Appreciation Potential

While the strategy allows for significant [upside potential](../u/upside_potential_in_trading.md), the extent of this potential is limited to the difference between the [call option](../c/call_option.md)'s [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) and the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price at expiration, minus the original premiums. Thus, if the [asset](../a/asset.md) price skyrockets beyond expectations, the gains are somewhat capped compared to holding the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) directly.

## 4. Example Scenarios

### 4.1. Bullish Market Scenario

Suppose an [investor](../i/investor.md) believes that stock XYZ, currently trading at $100, [will](../w/will.md) rise to $115 in the next three months. The [investor](../i/investor.md) buys a [call option](../c/call_option.md) with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $110, costing $2, and sells a [put option](../p/put.md) with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $90, receiving $2 in [premium](../p/premium.md).

- If XYZ rises to $115, the [call option](../c/call_option.md) can be exercised, resulting in a [profit](../p/profit.md) of ($115 - $110 - $2) = $3 per share.
- The [put option](../p/put.md) expires worthless, and the [premium](../p/premium.md) received offsets the call's cost, making the total [profit](../p/profit.md) = $3 per share.

### 4.2. Bearish Market Scenario

In a bearish [market](../m/market.md), if XYZ falls to $85, the [put option](../p/put.md) [will](../w/will.md) be exercised, obligating the [investor](../i/investor.md) to buy the stock at $90, resulting in a loss of ($90 - $85) - $2 = $3 per share (net of [premium](../p/premium.md) received).

## 5. Implementation Considerations

### 5.1. Analyzing Volatility

[Options](../o/options.md) pricing is heavily influenced by the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s [volatility](../v/volatility.md). High [volatility](../v/volatility.md) increases the premiums for both calls and puts, which can enhance the strategy's cost [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) (higher premiums for sold puts) but also increases the cost of purchased calls.

### 5.2. Market Conditions

The reverse [collar](../c/collar.md) strategy can be particularly effective in certain [market](../m/market.md) conditions:
- **[Range](../r/range.md)-bound [Market](../m/market.md)**: If the [market](../m/market.md) is expected to stay within a certain [range](../r/range.md), the [premium](../p/premium.md) [income](../i/income.md) from sold puts can provide a steady stream of [income](../i/income.md).
- **Moderately Bullish [Market](../m/market.md)**: This strategy is well-suited if the [market](../m/market.md) is expected to [rally](../r/rally.md) moderately.

## 6. Conclusion

The reverse [collar](../c/collar.md) strategy is a sophisticated [options](../o/options.md) trading approach providing traders with a balanced method to seek potential [profit](../p/profit.md) while managing risks. By combining long call [options](../o/options.md) and short [put options](../p/put_options.md), traders can capture upward movements in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price while limiting their downside exposure. However, it comes with inherent risks, such as the obligation to buy the [asset](../a/asset.md) and the potential for early [assignment](../a/assignment.md). 

For those interested in implementing the reverse [collar](../c/collar.md) strategy, it's crucial to analyze the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [market](../m/market.md) conditions, understand the [volatility](../v/volatility.md), and utilize proper [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) techniques. With these considerations in mind, traders can effectively utilize the reverse [collar](../c/collar.md) strategy to achieve their investment objectives.

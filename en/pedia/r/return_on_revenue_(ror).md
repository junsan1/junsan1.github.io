# Return on Revenue (ROR)

[Return](../r/return.md) on [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) (ROR) is a [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) metric that measures the profitability of a company by comparing its net [income](../i/income.md) to its [revenue](../r/revenue.md). It is an essential [indicator](../i/indicator.md) used by investors, analysts, and company managers to understand how efficiently a company is generating profits from its revenues. ROR is expressed as a percentage and is calculated using the following formula:

\[ \text{ROR} = \left( \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{[Revenue](../r/revenue.md)}} \right) \times 100 \]

### Key components

1. **Net [Income](../i/income.md)**: This is the [profit](../p/profit.md) of the company after all expenses, [taxes](../t/taxes.md), and costs have been subtracted from total [revenue](../r/revenue.md). It is often referred to as the [bottom line](../b/bottom_line.md), as it is typically the last figure reported on an [income statement](../i/income_statement.md).
2. **[Revenue](../r/revenue.md)**: This is the total [income](../i/income.md) generated by the company from its normal [business activities](../b/business_activities.md), usually from the [sale](../s/sale.md) of goods and services to customers. It is often referred to as the [top line](../t/top_line.md) because it is reported at the top of the [income statement](../i/income_statement.md).

### Importance of ROR

- **Profitability Assessment**: ROR helps in determining how much [profit](../p/profit.md) a company makes from its revenues. A higher ROR indicates greater profitability and [operational efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md).
- **[Comparative Analysis](../c/comparative_analysis.md)**: Investors can use ROR to compare companies within the same [industry](../i/industry.md) to determine which ones are more profitable.
- **Performance Tracking**: Management can track the ROR over different periods to assess the performance and effectiveness of [business](../b/business.md) strategies.
- **Investment Decision Making**: Potential investors can rely on ROR to make informed decisions about whether to invest in a company.

### Example Calculation

Consider Company ABC, which has a net [income](../i/income.md) of $50 million and total [revenue](../r/revenue.md) of $200 million. The ROR is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{ROR} = \left( \frac{50,000,000}{200,000,000} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

This means that for every dollar of [revenue](../r/revenue.md), Company ABC earns $0.25 in net [income](../i/income.md).

### Limitations of ROR

- **Does Not Account for Size**: ROR does not consider the size of the company. A smaller company might have a high ROR while generating significantly less [profit](../p/profit.md) than a larger company with a lower ROR.
- **One-dimensional**: It focuses solely on net [income](../i/income.md) relative to [revenue](../r/revenue.md) and does not take into account other financial metrics that might provide a more comprehensive view of performance.
- **[Variability](../v/variability.md)**: ROR can be influenced by various external factors such as [market](../m/market.md) conditions, economic downturns, and changes in regulation, which might not necessarily reflect the company’s [operational efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md).
- **Short-term Focus**: Management might be tempted to focus on short-term profitability at the [expense](../e/expense.md) of long-term strategy to improve ROR figures.

### Improving ROR

- **Cost Management**: Controlling and reducing operational costs without affecting [revenue](../r/revenue.md) can improve net [income](../i/income.md) and, thus, the ROR.
- **[Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Growth**: Increasing [revenue](../r/revenue.md) through new products, services, or [market penetration](../m/market_penetration.md) while maintaining or reducing costs can significantly impact ROR.
- **[Efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) Enhancements**: Streamlining operations, improving [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md) management, and utilizing technology effectively can help improve profitability.
- **Strategic Investments**: [Investing](../i/investing.md) in high-[return](../r/return.md) projects and divesting from underperforming assets can improve the overall ROR.

### ROR and Other Financial Metrics

While ROR is a valuable metric, it should be used in conjunction with other financial indicators to get a comprehensive view of a company’s [financial health](../f/financial_health.md):

- **[Return on Assets](../r/return_on_assets_(roa).md) (ROA)**: Measures how efficiently a company is using its assets to generate profits.
- **[Return](../r/return.md) on [Equity](../e/equity.md) (ROE)**: Indicates how effectively a company is using shareholders' [equity](../e/equity.md) to generate profits.
- **[Gross Profit Margin](../g/gross_profit_margin.md)**: Shows the [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) by revealing how much of every dollar of [revenue](../r/revenue.md) is left after paying for the cost of goods sold.
- **[Operating Margin](../o/operating_margin.md)**: Measures the proportion of [revenue](../r/revenue.md) left after paying for variable costs of production, such as wages and [raw materials](../r/raw_materials.md).

### Industry Analysis

Different industries might have varying average RORs due to the nature of the [business](../b/business.md), cost structures, and competitive landscapes. For instance:

- **[Technology Sector](../t/technology_sector.md)**: Often exhibits higher ROR due to lower marginal costs of production and significant [scalability](../s/scalability.md).
- **Retail Sector**: Typically has lower RORs due to high competition and thin [profit margins](../p/profit_margins_in_trading.md).
- **Financial Services**: Can have varying RORs depending on the type of service provided and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices.
- **[Manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md)**: Depends heavily on the [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) of operations and [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md) management.

### Conclusion

[Return](../r/return.md) on [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) (ROR) is a critical metric for assessing a company’s profitability in relation to its [revenue](../r/revenue.md). By considering net [income](../i/income.md) and [revenue](../r/revenue.md), it provides insights into the company's [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) in converting [revenue](../r/revenue.md) into actual [profit](../p/profit.md). However, it is not without limitations and should be used alongside other metrics for a comprehensive [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md). Whether for internal assessments or investment decisions, understanding and utilizing ROR can provide a significant advantage in [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md) and strategic planning.

# Realized Yield

Realized [yield](../y/yield.md) is a metric used in [finance](../f/finance.md) to measure the actual [return](../r/return.md) on an investment, based on the actual amount of [income](../i/income.md) received and the [capital](../c/capital.md) gains or losses experienced. This differs from the expected or [nominal yield](../n/nominal_yield.md), which estimates the returns based solely on forecasted [income](../i/income.md) and price changes. Realized [yield](../y/yield.md) gives investors a clear picture of their investment’s performance by [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for [interest](../i/interest.md) [income](../i/income.md), dividends, and changes in the investment's price over a specific period.

### Key Components of Realized Yield

1. **[Income](../i/income.md) Received:** This includes any [interest](../i/interest.md) payments or dividends that have been received from the investment.
2. **[Capital](../c/capital.md) Gains/Losses:** This is the [profit](../p/profit.md) or loss made from the [sale](../s/sale.md) of the investment or from changes in its [market value](../m/market_value.md).
3. **Time Period:** Realized [yield](../y/yield.md) is typically expressed on an annual [basis](../b/basis.md) but can be calculated for any specific time period.

### Formula for Realized Yield

The realized [yield](../y/yield.md) can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Realized Yield} = \left( \frac{\text{[Income](../i/income.md) Received} + (\text{Ending [Value](../v/value.md)} - \text{Beginning [Value](../v/value.md)})}{\text{Beginning [Value](../v/value.md)}} \right) \times 100 \]

Where:
- **[Income](../i/income.md) Received** is the total amount of [income](../i/income.md) generated by the investment during the period.
- **Ending [Value](../v/value.md)** is the [market value](../m/market_value.md) of the investment at the end of the period.
- **Beginning [Value](../v/value.md)** is the [market value](../m/market_value.md) of the investment at the beginning of the period.

### Example Calculation

Suppose an [investor](../i/investor.md) purchases a [bond](../b/bond.md) for $1,000 and receives $50 in [interest](../i/interest.md) payments over one year. At the end of the year, the [bond](../b/bond.md)’s [market value](../m/market_value.md) has increased to $1,100. The realized [yield](../y/yield.md) for this investment would be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Realized [Yield](../y/yield.md)} = \left( \frac{50 + (1100 - 1000)}{1000} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Realized [Yield](../y/yield.md)} = \left( \frac{50 + 100}{1000} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Realized [Yield](../y/yield.md)} = (0.15) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Realized [Yield](../y/yield.md)} = 15\% \]

Therefore, the realized [yield](../y/yield.md) on this investment is 15%.

### Importance in Investment Decisions

Realized [yield](../y/yield.md) is a crucial metric for investors as it:
- Reflects the actual performance of an investment.
- Helps in comparing the effectiveness of different investments.
- Assists in making informed decisions about future investments.

### Differences Between Realized and Expected Yield

- **Realized [Yield](../y/yield.md)** is based on actual performance and historical data.
- **Expected [Yield](../y/yield.md)** is based on predictions and forecasts about future performance.

### Practical Applications

#### Fixed Income Securities

For bonds and other fixed-[income](../i/income.md) securities, realized [yield](../y/yield.md) is particularly significant. These securities promise fixed payments, but the actual [yield](../y/yield.md) can vary due to changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and the prices of the securities themselves.

#### Equities

In the case of [stocks](../s/stock.md), realized [yield](../y/yield.md) includes [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payouts and any [capital](../c/capital.md) gains or losses. This makes it more unpredictable compared to fixed-[income](../i/income.md) investments but can provide higher returns.

### Realized Yield in Portfolio Management

Portfolio managers use realized [yield](../y/yield.md) to:
- Assess the performance of various assets within a portfolio.
- Rebalance portfolios to optimize returns.
- Evaluate the success of past investment strategies.

### Factors Influencing Realized Yield

1. **[Market](../m/market.md) Conditions:** [Interest](../i/interest.md) levels, [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md), and [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) can all impact realized [yield](../y/yield.md).
2. **[Time Horizon](../t/time_horizon.md):** The length of time an investment is held affects the realized [yield](../y/yield.md).
3. **Investment Type:** Different types of investments (e.g., bonds vs. [stocks](../s/stock.md)) [will](../w/will.md) have different factors influencing their realized yields.

### Advanced Strategies for Calculation

#### Duration and Convexity

For bonds, not only the realized [yield](../y/yield.md) but also the [duration](../d/duration.md) and [convexity](../c/convexity.md) need to be considered. These metrics help in assessing the sensitivity of a [bond](../b/bond.md)'s price to [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) changes, which in turn can affect the realized [yield](../y/yield.md).

#### Scenario Analysis

[Scenario analysis](../s/scenario_analysis.md) involves evaluating different potential outcomes for an investment's performance. This helps in understanding how different [market](../m/market.md) conditions can impact realized [yield](../y/yield.md).

### Tools and Software

Several financial tools and [software platforms](../s/software_platforms_for_trading.md) help in calculating realized [yield](../y/yield.md), such as:
- **[Bloomberg Terminal](../b/bloomberg_terminal.md):** Offers comprehensive data and analytics for calculating realized [yield](../y/yield.md).
- **[Morningstar](../m/morningstar.md):** Provides tools for analyzing the realized [yield](../y/yield.md) of mutual funds and ETFs.
- **Financial Calculators:** Online tools and spreadsheet models can be used to calculate realized yields.

### Conclusion

Realized [yield](../y/yield.md) is a fundamental concept in [finance](../f/finance.md), providing a clear measure of an investment's actual [return](../r/return.md). Understanding this metric is crucial for making informed investment decisions and effectively managing a portfolio. By considering both [income](../i/income.md) received and changes in [market value](../m/market_value.md), realized [yield](../y/yield.md) offers a complete picture of an investment's performance, helping investors to better evaluate their financial strategies.

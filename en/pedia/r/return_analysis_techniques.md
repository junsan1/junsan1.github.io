# Return Analysis Techniques

[Return](../r/return.md) analysis is the process of assessing the profitability and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) of an investment. It is an essential component in [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md) and [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md), especially in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) (algotrading). This section [will](../w/will.md) dive into various techniques used for analyzing [return](../r/return.md) on investments in the context of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md).

## Time-Weighted Rate of Return (TWRR)

The Time-[Weighted](../w/weighted.md) [Rate of Return](../r/rate_of_return.md) (TWRR) measures the compound rate of growth of an investment portfolio. TWRR is particularly useful in situations where the [investor](../i/investor.md) has made [multiple](../m/multiple.md) deposits and withdrawals. It neutralizes the impact of cash flows, providing a clearer picture of an investment's performance.

How to Calculate TWRR:
1. **Break Down the Periods**: Divide the overall investment period into sub-periods between each [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md).
2. **Calculate Individual Period Returns**: For each sub-period, compute the [return](../r/return.md) while ignoring the impact of [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md).
3. **Compound the Returns**: Multiply the individual period returns to get the overall TWRR.
   
\[ TWRR = \left( \prod_{i=1}^{n} (1 + R_i) \right)^{\frac{1}{n}} - 1 \]

Where \( R_i \) is the [return](../r/return.md) in sub-period i, and n is the total number of sub-periods.

## Money-Weighted Rate of Return (MWRR)

The [Money-Weighted Rate of Return](../m/money-weighted_rate_of_return.md) (MWRR), also known as the Internal [Rate of Return](../r/rate_of_return.md) (IRR), takes into account the timing and size of cash flows. This metric is useful for understanding the profitability of an investment from the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s perspective.

How to Calculate MWRR:
1. **Identify Cash Flows**: List all cash inflows and outflows, including the initial investment.
2. **Solve for IRR**: Use a financial calculator or spreadsheet software to find the [discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md) that sets the net [present value](../p/present_value.md) (NPV) of these cash flows to zero.

\[ \text{NPV} = \sum_{t=0}^{T} \frac{C_t}{(1 + IRR)^t} = 0 \]

Where \( C_t \) is the [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) at time t, and T is the total number of periods.

## Sharpe Ratio

The [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) is a measure of [risk-adjusted return](../r/risk-adjusted_return.md). It indicates how much [excess return](../e/excess_return.md) you receive for the extra [volatility](../v/volatility.md) you endure for holding a riskier [asset](../a/asset.md).

How to Calculate [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md):
1. **Calculate [Excess Return](../e/excess_return.md)**: Subtract the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate (Rf) from the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s [return](../r/return.md) (R).
2. **Calculate [Standard Deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md)**: Compute the [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) (σ) of the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s [return](../r/return.md).
3. **Compute [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md)**: Divide the [excess return](../e/excess_return.md) by the [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md).

\[ \text{[Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md)} = \frac{R - R_f}{\sigma} \]

Where R is the [average return](../a/average_return.md) of the [asset](../a/asset.md), Rf is the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate, and σ is the [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) of the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s returns.

## Sortino Ratio

The [Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md) is similar to the [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md) but focuses only on the [downside deviation](../d/downside_deviation.md) rather than the [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md). This ratio provides a more accurate measure of [risk-adjusted return](../r/risk-adjusted_return.md) for assets that are asymmetrical in their [return](../r/return.md) [distribution](../d/distribution.md), penalizing only the undesirable [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

\[ \text{[Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md)} = \frac{R - R_f}{\sigma_D} \]

Where σ_D is the [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) of the negative [asset](../a/asset.md) returns.

## Jensen's Alpha

[Jensen's Alpha](../j/jensen's_alpha.md) measures the [abnormal return](../a/abnormal_return.md) of an [asset](../a/asset.md), comparing its performance against the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) based on the [Capital Asset](../c/capital_asset.md) Pricing Model (CAPM).

How to Calculate [Jensen's Alpha](../j/jensen's_alpha.md):
1. **Calculate [Expected Return](../e/expected_return.md)**: Using the CAPM, calculate the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) on the [asset](../a/asset.md):

\[ E(R_i) = R_f + \beta_i (R_m - R_f) \]

   Where \( E(R_i) \) is the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) of the [asset](../a/asset.md), \( \beta_i \) is the [beta](../b/beta.md) of the [asset](../a/asset.md), \( R_m \) is the [market](../m/market.md) [return](../r/return.md), and \( R_f \) is the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate.
2. **Compute Actual [Return](../r/return.md)**: Determine the actual [return](../r/return.md) of the [asset](../a/asset.md) (R_a).
3. **Find [Alpha](../a/alpha.md)**: Subtract the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) from the actual [return](../r/return.md).

\[ \text{[Alpha](../a/alpha.md)} = R_a - E(R_i) \]

Where [Alpha](../a/alpha.md) represents the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s abnormal performance.

## Treynor Ratio

The [Treynor Ratio](../t/treynor_ratio.md) provides a measure of [risk-adjusted return](../r/risk-adjusted_return.md) based on [systematic risk](../s/systematic_risk.md), represented by the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s [beta](../b/beta.md).

How to Calculate [Treynor Ratio](../t/treynor_ratio.md):
1. **Calculate [Excess Return](../e/excess_return.md)**: Subtract the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate (Rf) from the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s [return](../r/return.md) (R).
2. **Find the [Beta](../b/beta.md)**: Determine the [beta](../b/beta.md) (β) of the [asset](../a/asset.md).
3. **Compute [Treynor Ratio](../t/treynor_ratio.md)**: Divide the [excess return](../e/excess_return.md) by the [beta](../b/beta.md).

\[ \text{[Treynor Ratio](../t/treynor_ratio.md)} = \frac{R - R_f}{\[beta](../b/beta.md)} \]

Where R is the [average return](../a/average_return.md) of the [asset](../a/asset.md), Rf is the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate, and β is the [beta](../b/beta.md) of the [asset](../a/asset.md).

## Information Ratio

The [Information Ratio](../i/information_ratio.md) measures the returns of an [asset](../a/asset.md) relative to a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md), adjusted for [tracking error](../t/tracking_error.md). It helps in assessing the skill of a [portfolio manager](../p/portfolio_manager.md) in generating excess returns compared to a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md).

How to Calculate [Information Ratio](../i/information_ratio.md):
1. **Calculate [Excess Return](../e/excess_return.md)**: Subtract the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [return](../r/return.md) (R_b) from the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s [return](../r/return.md) (R).
2. **Calculate [Tracking Error](../t/tracking_error.md)**: Find the [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) (σ_e) of the [excess return](../e/excess_return.md).
3. **Compute [Information Ratio](../i/information_ratio.md)**: Divide the [excess return](../e/excess_return.md) by the [tracking error](../t/tracking_error.md).

\[ \text{[Information Ratio](../i/information_ratio.md)} = \frac{R - R_b}{\sigma_e} \]

Where R is the [average return](../a/average_return.md) of the [asset](../a/asset.md), R_b is the [average return](../a/average_return.md) of the [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md), and σ_e is the [tracking error](../t/tracking_error.md).

## Maximum Drawdown (MDD)

Maximum [Drawdown](../d/drawdown.md) (MDD) measures the largest peak-to-[trough](../t/trough.md) decline in the [value](../v/value.md) of a portfolio. It indicates the potential [risk](../r/risk.md) and loss investors might face.

How to Calculate MDD:
1. **Identify Peak Values**: Find the highest values of the portfolio over time.
2. **Identify [Trough](../t/trough.md) Values**: For each peak, find the lowest values following the peak until a new peak is reached.
3. **Determine MDD**: Calculate the difference between each peak and [trough](../t/trough.md) and find the maximum [drawdown](../d/drawdown.md).

\[ \text{MDD} = \frac{\text{[Trough](../t/trough.md) [Value](../v/value.md)} - \text{Peak [Value](../v/value.md)}}{\text{Peak [Value](../v/value.md)}} \]

Where the [trough](../t/trough.md) [value](../v/value.md) is the lowest [value](../v/value.md) following the peak.

## Calmar Ratio

The Calmar Ratio is used to measure [risk-adjusted return](../r/risk-adjusted_return.md), considering the Maximum [Drawdown](../d/drawdown.md) (MDD) instead of [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

How to Calculate Calmar Ratio:
1. **Calculate [Annual Return](../a/annual_return.md)**: Determine the [annual return](../a/annual_return.md) of the [asset](../a/asset.md).
2. **Determine MDD**: Find the Maximum [Drawdown](../d/drawdown.md) as described above.
3. **Compute Calmar Ratio**: Divide the [annual return](../a/annual_return.md) by the MDD.

\[ \text{Calmar Ratio} = \frac{\text{[Annual Return](../a/annual_return.md)}}{\text{MDD}} \]

Where the [annual return](../a/annual_return.md) is the [return](../r/return.md) of the [asset](../a/asset.md) over a year and MDD is the Maximum [Drawdown](../d/drawdown.md).

## Omega Ratio

The [Omega](../o/omega.md) Ratio compares the probability-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) gains relative to the probability-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) losses for a given threshold [return](../r/return.md). It provides a comprehensive measure of an [asset](../a/asset.md)'s [return](../r/return.md) [distribution](../d/distribution.md).

How to Calculate [Omega](../o/omega.md) Ratio:
1. **Set Threshold [Return](../r/return.md)**: Define a minimum acceptable [return](../r/return.md) (MAR).
2. **Calculate Gains and Losses**: Integrate the returns above and below the MAR.
3. **Compute [Omega](../o/omega.md) Ratio**: Find the ratio of [weighted](../w/weighted.md) gains to [weighted](../w/weighted.md) losses.

\[ \text{[Omega](../o/omega.md) Ratio} = \frac{\int_{MAR}^{\infty} (1 - F(R)) dR}{\int_{-\infty}^{MAR} F(R) dR} \]

Where F(R) is the [cumulative distribution function](../c/cumulative_distribution_function_in_trading.md) of the returns R.

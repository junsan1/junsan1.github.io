# Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT)

A Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) is a company that owns, operates, or finances income-generating real estate. Modeled after mutual funds, REITs provide individual investors with the opportunity to earn a share of the income produced through commercial real estate ownership without having to buy, manage, or finance any properties themselves. 

REITs allow anyone to invest in portfolios of real estate assets the same way they invest in other industries – through the purchase of individual company stock or through a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF). The stockholders of a REIT earn a share of the income produced – without actually having to go out and buy, manage, or finance property.

## Historical Background and Concept Overview

REITs were created in the United States in 1960 under the Cigar Excise Tax Extension Act. They were designed to provide all investors the chance to invest in commercial real estate assets in the same way they invest in other asset classes – through purchasing shares. REITs have since become a key part of the investment landscape and are an established means of accessing the commercial real estate market.

## Structures and Types of REITs

### Equity REITs

Equity REITs own and operate income-generating real estate. Revenue predominantly comes from leasing space and collecting rents on properties. Equity REITs commonly own and manage properties such as office buildings, shopping malls, apartments, and hotels.

### Mortgage REITs (mREITs)

Mortgage REITs provide financing for income-producing real estate by purchasing or originating mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. These REITs generate income from the interest on the financing.

### Hybrid REITs

Hybrid REITs combine the investment strategies of both equity REITs and mortgage REITs, thereby diversifying their portfolios by owning both properties and mortgages.

## How REITs Work

REITs must operate under specific regulations to maintain their status:

1. **Organizational Requirements**: A REIT must be structured as a corporation, trust, or association and managed by a board of directors or trustees.
2. **Investor Requirements**: A REIT must have a minimum of 100 shareholders and cannot be closely held, meaning no more than 50% of its shares can be held by five or fewer individuals.
3. **Income Requirements**: At least 75% of a REIT's gross income must come from real estate-related activities. Additionally, 95% of its income must be derived from these activities plus dividends or interest.
4. **Asset Requirements**: At least 75% of a REIT's assets must be invested in real estate, cash, or U.S. Treasuries.
5. **Distribution Requirements**: REITs must distribute at least 90% of taxable income in the form of dividends to their shareholders annually.

## Benefits of Investing in REITs

### Income Generation

REITs are required to pay out most of their earnings as dividends, making them an attractive investment for income-seeking investors. These dividends can provide a steady income stream, often with a yield higher than most other fixed-income investments.

### Diversification

Adding REITs to an investment portfolio can provide diversification benefits as real estate often has a low correlation with other asset classes like stocks and bonds.

### Liquidity

Unlike direct real estate investments, which can be difficult to buy and sell quickly, REITs provide high liquidity as they are traded on major stock exchanges.

### Inflation Protection

Real estate often acts as a good hedge against inflation. As inflation rises, property prices and rents typically increase, potentially leading to higher dividends for REIT investors.

### Professional Management

REITs are managed by skilled professionals who handle property management, acquisitions, and divestitures, thus removing the burden of active real estate management from individual investors.

## Risks of Investing in REITs

### Market Risk

Like all publicly traded equities, REITs are subject to market volatility. The price of REIT shares can fluctuate based on factors like economic conditions, interest rates, and market sentiment.

### Interest Rate Risk

REITs are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Rising interest rates can increase borrowing costs and reduce the value of existing mortgages, which can adversely affect mortgage REITs in particular.

### Property-Specific Risk

The performance of a REIT can be highly dependent on the quality of its property portfolio and management effectiveness. Factors such as location, property type, and lease terms can significantly impact returns.

### Leverage Risk

REITs often use leverage (debt) to finance property acquisitions. While leverage can enhance returns in favorable markets, it can also increase the risk of losses during downturns.

## Evaluating REIT Performance

### Funds From Operations (FFO)

Funds From Operations (FFO) is a key metric used to evaluate a REIT's performance. FFO is calculated by adding depreciation and amortization to earnings and adjusting for gains or losses on sales of properties. FFO provides a more accurate reflection of a REIT's operational performance than net income.

### Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO)

Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) goes a step further by adjusting FFO for recurring capital expenditures necessary to maintain properties. AFFO is considered a more precise indicator of a REIT's ability to generate cash flow and may be used as a basis for setting dividend payouts.

### Net Asset Value (NAV)

Net Asset Value (NAV) represents the value of a REIT's assets minus its liabilities. NAV per share is used to determine if a REIT is trading at a premium or discount to its underlying value. Comparing the market price of a REIT's shares to its NAV per share can provide insight into the market's perception of the REIT's prospects.

## Taxation of REITs

### Corporate Taxation

REITs do not pay corporate income tax at the federal level in the U.S. if they comply with certain regulatory requirements, including the distribution of at least 90% of taxable income as dividends.

### Dividend Taxation

REIT dividends are generally taxed as ordinary income to the shareholders, which may be at a higher rate than qualified dividends from other types of corporations. However, a portion of REIT dividends may be classified as return of capital, which is not taxable but reduces the investor's cost basis in the REIT shares.

## REIT Investing Strategies

### Income-Generating REITs

Investors seeking stable income might focus on REITs with a history of consistent dividend payouts. These REITs generally invest in properties with stable, long-term lease agreements, such as office buildings and retail centers.

### Growth-Oriented REITs

More aggressive investors might look for REITs that are focused on growth through property acquisitions and development. These REITs may reinvest a significant portion of their earnings into expanding their property portfolios, potentially leading to significant capital appreciation.

### Sector-Specific REITs

Investors may choose REITs based on specific property sectors, such as residential, industrial, healthcare, or data centers. Sector-specific REITs allow investors to capitalize on trends within particular real estate segments.

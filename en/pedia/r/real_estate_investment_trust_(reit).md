# Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT)

A [Real Estate](../r/real_estate.md) Investment [Trust](../t/trust.md) (REIT) is a company that owns, operates, or finances [income](../i/income.md)-generating [real estate](../r/real_estate.md). Modeled after mutual funds, REITs provide individual investors with the opportunity to earn a share of the [income](../i/income.md) produced through [commercial real estate](../c/commercial_real_estate.md) ownership without having to buy, manage, or [finance](../f/finance.md) any properties themselves. 

REITs allow anyone to invest in portfolios of [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) assets the same way they invest in other industries – through the purchase of individual company stock or through a [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md) or [exchange](../e/exchange.md)-traded [fund](../f/fund.md) (ETF). The stockholders of a REIT earn a share of the [income](../i/income.md) produced – without actually having to go out and buy, manage, or [finance](../f/finance.md) property.

## Historical Background and Concept Overview

REITs were created in the United States in 1960 under the Cigar [Excise Tax](../e/excise_tax.md) Extension Act. They were designed to provide all investors the chance to invest in [commercial real estate](../c/commercial_real_estate.md) assets in the same way they invest in other [asset](../a/asset.md) classes – through purchasing [shares](../s/shares.md). REITs have since become a key part of the investment landscape and are an established means of accessing the [commercial real estate](../c/commercial_real_estate.md) [market](../m/market.md).

## Structures and Types of REITs

### Equity REITs

[Equity](../e/equity.md) REITs own and operate [income](../i/income.md)-generating [real estate](../r/real_estate.md). [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) predominantly comes from leasing space and collecting rents on properties. [Equity](../e/equity.md) REITs commonly own and manage properties such as office buildings, shopping malls, apartments, and hotels.

### Mortgage REITs (mREITs)

[Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) REITs provide [financing](../f/financing.md) for [income](../i/income.md)-producing [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) by purchasing or originating mortgages and [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-backed securities. These REITs generate [income](../i/income.md) from the [interest](../i/interest.md) on the [financing](../f/financing.md).

### Hybrid REITs

Hybrid REITs combine the investment strategies of both [equity](../e/equity.md) REITs and [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) REITs, thereby diversifying their portfolios by owning both properties and mortgages.

## How REITs Work

REITs must operate under specific regulations to maintain their status:

1. **Organizational Requirements**: A REIT must be structured as a [corporation](../c/corporation.md), [trust](../t/trust.md), or association and managed by a board of directors or trustees.
2. **[Investor](../i/investor.md) Requirements**: A REIT must have a minimum of 100 shareholders and cannot be closely held, meaning no more than 50% of its [shares](../s/shares.md) can be held by five or fewer individuals.
3. **[Income](../i/income.md) Requirements**: At least 75% of a REIT's [gross income](../g/gross_income.md) must come from [real estate](../r/real_estate.md)-related activities. Additionally, 95% of its [income](../i/income.md) must be derived from these activities plus dividends or [interest](../i/interest.md).
4. **[Asset](../a/asset.md) Requirements**: At least 75% of a REIT's assets must be invested in [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), cash, or U.S. Treasuries.
5. **[Distribution](../d/distribution.md) Requirements**: REITs must distribute at least 90% of [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md) in the form of dividends to their shareholders annually.

## Benefits of Investing in REITs

### Income Generation

REITs are required to pay out most of their [earnings](../e/earnings.md) as dividends, making them an attractive investment for [income](../i/income.md)-seeking investors. These dividends can provide a steady [income](../i/income.md) stream, often with a [yield](../y/yield.md) higher than most other fixed-[income](../i/income.md) investments.

### Diversification

Adding REITs to an investment portfolio can provide [diversification benefits](../d/diversification_benefits.md) as [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) often has a low [correlation](../c/correlation.md) with other [asset](../a/asset.md) classes like [stocks](../s/stock.md) and bonds.

### Liquidity

Unlike direct [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) investments, which can be difficult to buy and sell quickly, REITs provide high [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) as they are traded on major stock exchanges.

### Inflation Protection

[Real estate](../r/real_estate.md) often acts as a good [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against [inflation](../i/inflation.md). As [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rises, property prices and rents typically increase, potentially leading to higher dividends for REIT investors.

### Professional Management

REITs are managed by skilled professionals who [handle](../h/handle.md) [property management](../p/property_management.md), acquisitions, and divestitures, thus removing the burden of active [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) management from individual investors.

## Risks of Investing in REITs

### Market Risk

Like all publicly traded equities, REITs are subject to [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md). The price of REIT [shares](../s/shares.md) can fluctuate based on factors like [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md), [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, and [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md).

### Interest Rate Risk

REITs are sensitive to changes in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. Rising [interest](../i/interest.md) rates can increase borrowing costs and reduce the [value](../v/value.md) of existing mortgages, which can adversely affect [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) REITs in particular.

### Property-Specific Risk

The performance of a REIT can be highly dependent on the quality of its property portfolio and management effectiveness. Factors such as location, property type, and lease terms can significantly impact returns.

### Leverage Risk

REITs often use [leverage](../l/leverage.md) ([debt](../d/debt.md)) to [finance](../f/finance.md) property acquisitions. While [leverage](../l/leverage.md) can enhance returns in favorable markets, it can also increase the [risk](../r/risk.md) of losses during downturns.

## Evaluating REIT Performance

### Funds From Operations (FFO)

Funds From Operations (FFO) is a key metric used to evaluate a REIT's performance. FFO is calculated by adding [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) and amortization to [earnings](../e/earnings.md) and adjusting for gains or losses on sales of properties. FFO provides a more accurate reflection of a REIT's operational performance than net [income](../i/income.md).

### Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO)

Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) goes a step further by adjusting FFO for recurring [capital](../c/capital.md) expenditures necessary to maintain properties. AFFO is considered a more precise [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of a REIT's ability to generate [cash flow](../c/cash_flow.md) and may be used as a [basis](../b/basis.md) for setting [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payouts.

### Net Asset Value (NAV)

Net [Asset](../a/asset.md) [Value](../v/value.md) (NAV) represents the [value](../v/value.md) of a REIT's assets minus its liabilities. NAV per share is used to determine if a REIT is trading at a [premium](../p/premium.md) or [discount](../d/discount.md) to its [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [value](../v/value.md). Comparing the [market price](../m/market_price.md) of a REIT's [shares](../s/shares.md) to its NAV per share can provide insight into the [market](../m/market.md)'s perception of the REIT's prospects.

## Taxation of REITs

### Corporate Taxation

REITs do not pay corporate [income tax](../i/income_tax.md) at the federal level in the U.S. if they comply with certain regulatory requirements, including the [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of at least 90% of [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md) as dividends.

### Dividend Taxation

REIT dividends are generally taxed as [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md) to the shareholders, which may be at a higher rate than qualified dividends from other types of corporations. However, a portion of REIT dividends may be classified as [return](../r/return.md) of [capital](../c/capital.md), which is not taxable but reduces the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s [cost basis](../c/cost_basis.md) in the REIT [shares](../s/shares.md).

## REIT Investing Strategies

### Income-Generating REITs

Investors seeking stable [income](../i/income.md) might focus on REITs with a history of consistent [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payouts. These REITs generally invest in properties with stable, long-term lease agreements, such as office buildings and retail centers.

### Growth-Oriented REITs

More aggressive investors might look for REITs that are focused on growth through property acquisitions and development. These REITs may reinvest a significant portion of their [earnings](../e/earnings.md) into expanding their property portfolios, potentially leading to significant [capital](../c/capital.md) appreciation.

### Sector-Specific REITs

Investors may choose REITs based on specific property sectors, such as residential, industrial, healthcare, or data centers. Sector-specific REITs allow investors to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on trends within particular [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) segments.

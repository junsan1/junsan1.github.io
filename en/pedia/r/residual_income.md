# Residual Income

Residual [income](../i/income.md) is a concept in [finance](../f/finance.md) and investment that refers to the [profit](../p/profit.md) generated by an individual, company, or [asset](../a/asset.md) that continues to come in after the initial effort has been expended. In other words, it's the [income](../i/income.md) that one receives on a regular [basis](../b/basis.md) with little to no ongoing effort. This concept is critically important in various fields including [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md), [personal finance](../p/personal_finance_in_trading.md), and investment, providing a measure of profitability beyond traditional metrics like net [income](../i/income.md) or [earnings](../e/earnings.md) per share (EPS).

## Types of Residual Income

### Corporate Finance

In the realm of [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md), residual [income](../i/income.md) is used as a performance metric. It is calculated by subtracting the [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md) from the companyâ€™s net [operating profit](../o/operating_profit.md) after [taxes](../t/taxes.md) (NOPAT). This measure is often used to evaluate the profitability of individual projects or [business](../b/business.md) units. 

The formula for residual [income](../i/income.md) in [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md):
\[ \text{Residual Income} = \text{NOPAT} - (\text{[Capital Employed](../c/capital_employed.md)} \times \text{[Cost of Capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md)}) \]

### Personal Finance

In [personal finance](../p/personal_finance_in_trading.md), residual [income](../i/income.md) can refer to a variety of [income](../i/income.md) streams that require minimal ongoing work. Examples include rental [income](../i/income.md), royalties, dividends, and [interest](../i/interest.md) from investments. Achieving significant residual [income](../i/income.md) can be a cornerstone of financial independence or early retirement plans.

### Investment

In [investment analysis](../i/investment_analysis.md), residual [income](../i/income.md) can be used to evaluate the [intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) of a stock. The residual [income](../i/income.md) model (RIM), also known as the residual [income](../i/income.md) [valuation](../v/valuation.md), helps in determining whether a stock is [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md) or [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) based on the residual [income](../i/income.md) a company is expected to generate.

The model can be represented as follows:
\[ V = BV + \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} \frac{RI_t}{(1 + r)^t} \]
where:
- \( V \) = [Intrinsic value](../i/intrinsic_value.md) of the stock
- \( BV \) = [Book value](../b/book_value.md) of [equity](../e/equity.md)
- \( RI \) = Residual [income](../i/income.md) for period \( t \)
- \( r \) = [Cost of equity](../c/cost_of_equity.md)

## Applications of Residual Income

### Corporate Performance Measurement

Companies use residual [income](../i/income.md) to evaluate the [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) of different departments, divisions, or projects. By incorporating the [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md) into profitability calculations, it provides a more accurate picture of whether a division is adding [value](../v/value.md).

### Stock Valuation

Investors utilize the residual [income](../i/income.md) model to determine the [value](../v/value.md) of a company's stock. Unlike traditional models that rely heavily on dividends or [earnings](../e/earnings.md), RIM focuses on the [surplus](../s/surplus.md) [earnings](../e/earnings.md) generated over the required [rate of return](../r/rate_of_return.md). This is particularly useful for evaluating companies that do not pay dividends or have irregular [earnings](../e/earnings.md).

### Financial Independence

For individuals seeking financial independence, building [multiple](../m/multiple.md) streams of residual [income](../i/income.md) can provide a sustainable source of [revenue](../r/revenue.md). This can come from various sources such as rental properties, dividends from [stocks](../s/stock.md), royalties from creative works, and more.

## Advantages of Residual Income

- **Incorporates [Cost of Capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md)**: One of the biggest advantages is that it accounts for the [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md), providing a clearer picture of true economic profitability.
- **Flexible**: Can be applied to various contexts including [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md), [personal finance](../p/personal_finance_in_trading.md), and investment valuations.
- **Focus on [Value](../v/value.md) Creation**: Unlike traditional metrics, residual [income](../i/income.md) stresses the importance of [value](../v/value.md) creation beyond just earning an [income](../i/income.md).

## Disadvantages of Residual Income

- **Complexity**: Calculating residual [income](../i/income.md), particularly in corporate settings involving [multiple](../m/multiple.md) divisions and projects, can be complex and time-consuming.
- **Assumptions**: The accuracy of the residual [income](../i/income.md) model depends on the accuracy of the assumptions related to [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md) and future [income](../i/income.md) streams.
- **Not Widely Used**: Despite its benefits, residual [income](../i/income.md) is not as widely used as other [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md) like net [income](../i/income.md) or EPS, primarily due to its complexity.

## Case Studies

### General Electric (GE)

General Electric (GE) has used residual [income](../i/income.md) as part of its internal [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md). By comparing the residual [income](../i/income.md) of different [business](../b/business.md) units, GE was able to better allocate resources and strategic efforts toward the most profitable divisions.

### Microsoft

Microsoft utilizes residual [income](../i/income.md) models to evaluate the profitability of its product divisions. Doing so has enabled more efficient resource allocation, especially in their highly profitable segments like cloud services and software. More details can be found on their [official site](https://www.microsoft.com).

## Conclusion

Residual [income](../i/income.md) is a versatile concept with wide-ranging applications in [finance](../f/finance.md) and investment. Whether used for assessing corporate performance, valuing [stocks](../s/stock.md), or building personal [wealth](../w/wealth.md), it offers a more nuanced view of profitability by taking into account the [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md). Despite its complexity, the benefits of this metric make it a valuable tool for managers, investors, and individuals alike.

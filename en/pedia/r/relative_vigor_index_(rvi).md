# Relative Vigor Index (RVI)

The Relative Vigor [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (RVI) is a [momentum](../m/momentum.md) [oscillator](../o/oscillator.md) that measures the conviction of a recent price move and the likelihood that it [will](../w/will.md) continue. The RVI is predicated on the premise that prices tend to close higher during an [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md) and lower during a [downtrend](../d/downtrend.md). Similar in construction to the [Stochastic Oscillator](../s/stochastic_oscillator.md) and [Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (RSI), the RVI is a more complex calculation that emphasizes "vigor" or enthusiasm and uses a smoothed normalized method. By comparing the closing price of a [security](../s/security.md) to its trading [range](../r/range.md), it offers insights into the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) strength or weakness of a [trend](../t/trend.md).

## Calculation

The Relative Vigor [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) primarily uses the closing price relative to the [open](../o/open.md), high, and low prices of each period to calculate the [value](../v/value.md). The exact formula for RVI involves [multiple](../m/multiple.md) steps:

1. **Calculate the Close-[Open](../o/open.md) Differences:**
   \( RVI\_numerator = (Close - [Open](../o/open.md)) \)
   
2. **Calculate the High-Low Differences:**
   \( RVI\_denominator = (High - Low) \)
   
3. **Smooth the Results Using a Moving Average:**
   Usually, a simple moving average (SMA) of 10 periods is applied to both the numerator and denominator to smooth the data.
   
4. **Compute RVI Values:**
   The final RVI [value](../v/value.md) is the ratio of the smoothed numerator to the smoothed denominator.
   
   \[
   RVI = \frac{SMA(RVI\_numerator, n)}{SMA(RVI\_denominator, n)}
   \]

5. **Signal Line:**
   Similar to the MACD, a signal line is created by computing an additional moving average (usually a 4-period SMA) of the RVI for further validation.

The RVI oscillates around a zero line and typically ranges between -1 and +1. The zero line serves as a midpoint to identify shifts in [momentum](../m/momentum.md).

## Interpretation

The main interpretation principle of the Relative Vigor [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) is to look for crossovers between the RVI line and the signal line:

- **Bullish Signal:** An RVI cross above the signal line can indicate a buy signal, suggesting the potential for an upward [trend](../t/trend.md).
- **Bearish Signal:** Conversely, an RVI cross below the signal line can signal selling opportunities, hinting at potential downward movement.

Additionally, when the RVI crosses above zero, it implies bullish [momentum](../m/momentum.md), while a cross below zero indicates bearish [momentum](../m/momentum.md). Many traders also look for divergences between the RVI and the price, which can be a powerful signal of [trend](../t/trend.md) reversals.

## Practical Uses

1. **[Trend](../t/trend.md) Confirmation:**
   Traders often use the Relative Vigor [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) to confirm the direction of the [market](../m/market.md) [trend](../t/trend.md). When the RVI aligns with the price [trend](../t/trend.md), it adds credence to the ongoing [market](../m/market.md) movement.

2. **[Divergence](../d/divergence.md) Analysis:**
   [Divergence](../d/divergence.md) occurs when the price moves in one direction while the RVI moves in another. [Bullish divergence](../b/bullish_divergence.md) happens when prices make lower lows, but the RVI makes higher lows. Conversely, [bearish divergence](../b/bearish_divergence.md) occurs when prices make higher highs, but the RVI makes lower highs.

3. **Entry and Exit Points:**
   The RVI can help pinpoint optimal entry and exit points by signaling potential shifts in [market](../m/market.md) direction based on the crossings above or below the zero line and signal line.

4. **Filter for Other Indicators:**
   The Relative Vigor [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) can be used alongside other [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) indicators to filter out [false signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md) and enhance trading accuracy.

## Limitations

While RVI can be a useful tool in [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md), it also has some limitations:

- **[Lagging Indicator](../l/lagging_indicator.md):** As with many oscillators, RVI is a [lagging indicator](../l/lagging_indicator.md) and may sometimes provide delayed signals.
- **[False Signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md):** In volatile markets, the [indicator](../i/indicator.md) might generate [false signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md), leading to potential trading losses.
- **Complexity:** The RVIâ€™s calculation is more complex than other simpler [momentum indicators](../m/momentum_indicators.md), which might be overwhelming for novice traders.

## Example

Here is a practical implementation of RVI in Python using the `pandas` and `numpy` libraries:

```python
[import](../i/import.md) pandas as pd
[import](../i/import.md) numpy as np

def relative_vigor_index(df, period=10, signal_period=4):
    # Calculate the Close-[Open](../o/open.md) and High-Low differences
    df['CO_Diff'] = df['Close'] - df['[Open](../o/open.md)']
    df['HL_Diff'] = df['High'] - df['Low']

    # Smooth the results using a Simple Moving Average
    df['SMA_CO'] = df['CO_Diff'].rolling(window=period).mean()
    df['SMA_HL'] = df['HL_Diff'].rolling(window=period).mean()

    # Compute the RVI
    df['RVI'] = df['SMA_CO'] / df['SMA_HL']

    # Calculate the Signal Line
    df['Signal_Line'] = df['RVI'].rolling(window=signal_period).mean()

    [return](../r/return.md) df[['RVI', 'Signal_Line']]

# Example usage
data = pd.DataFrame({
    '[Open](../o/open.md)': [...],
    'High': [...],
    'Low': [...],
    'Close': [...]
})

rvi_df = relative_vigor_index(data)
print(rvi_df.tail())
```

## Application in Algorithmic Trading

In [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), the implementation of the Relative Vigor [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) can be automated to create [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) and signals. For instance, using `Zipline`, a Pythonic [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) library, you could create a strategy that buys or sells assets based on RVI signals.

Given the complex nature of RVI, its integration within an [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) strategy often includes [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) to validate its efficacy under different [market](../m/market.md) conditions. This can help in adjusting the parameters for optimal performance.

## Conclusion

The Relative Vigor [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (RVI) is a valuable addition to the toolkit of both manual and algorithmic traders. By emphasizing the closing price relative to the trading [range](../r/range.md), it provides unique insights into [market](../m/market.md) [momentum](../m/momentum.md) and potential future price movements. However, as with all [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicator.md), it's crucial to use RVI in conjunction with other tools and analyses to enhance decision-making accuracy.

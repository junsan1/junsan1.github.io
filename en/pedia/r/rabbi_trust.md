# Rabbi Trust

A Rabbi [Trust](../t/trust.md) is an [irrevocable trust](../i/irrevocable_trust.md) created by an employer to [hold](../h/hold.md) and protect [deferred compensation](../d/deferred_compensation.md) for its employees. Named because the Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Service (IRS) gave its initial approval to a [trust](../t/trust.md) established by a rabbi, the Rabbi [Trust](../t/trust.md) primarily serves as a mechanism to provide employees with a degree of [security](../s/security.md) over their [deferred compensation](../d/deferred_compensation.md). This financial tool is particularly relevant in the context of executive compensation plans, as it helps assure employees that their deferred [earnings](../e/earnings.md) [will](../w/will.md) be available to them in the event of certain contingencies.

## Legal Framework and Background

Rabbi Trusts owe their legal underpinning to various sections of the Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Code (IRC) and [guidance](../g/guidance.md) provided by the IRS. Under [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Procedure 92-64, key provisions and characteristics of a Rabbi [Trust](../t/trust.md) were laid out, providing a standardized template for organizations to follow. These guidelines aim to strike a balance between providing [security](../s/security.md) for employees and not guaranteeing them protection from general creditors in the event of the employer's [insolvency](../i/insolvency.md)—thus keeping the [deferred compensation](../d/deferred_compensation.md) from being considered as "constructively received" and subject to immediate [taxation](../t/taxation.md).

### Key Characteristics

1. **Irrevocability**: Once established, the employer cannot unilaterally revoke the [trust](../t/trust.md). This assures employees that the [trust](../t/trust.md)’s assets are committed for their benefit.

2. **Controlled Use of [Trust](../t/trust.md) Assets**: The assets held within a Rabbi [Trust](../t/trust.md) are typically invested and can only be used to pay the [deferred compensation](../d/deferred_compensation.md) or other benefits specified in the [trust](../t/trust.md) agreement.

3. **[Creditor](../c/creditor.md) Exposure**: In the event of the employer’s [insolvency](../i/insolvency.md), assets in a Rabbi [Trust](../t/trust.md) remain subject to the claims of general creditors. This is crucial to ensure that employees are not considered to have “constructive receipt” of the funds and are thus not immediately taxed on the deferred amounts.

4. **Non-qualified Status**: Rabbi Trusts are typically used in non-qualified [deferred compensation](../d/deferred_compensation.md) plans, differentiating them from qualified plans like 401(k)s.

### Structure and Operation

Rabbi Trusts usually involve the following key components:

1. **[Grantor](../g/grantor.md)**: The employer that establishes the [trust](../t/trust.md).
2. **[Trustee](../t/trustee.md)**: An appointed individual or entity responsible for managing the [trust](../t/trust.md) assets.
3. **Beneficiaries**: Usually, employees or executives entitled to the [deferred compensation](../d/deferred_compensation.md).
4. **[Trust](../t/trust.md) Agreement**: The legal document outlining the terms, conditions, and operational guidelines of the [trust](../t/trust.md).

### Funding

Rabbi Trusts are often funded through a variety of means including cash contributions, corporate stock, or other assets. This funding is usually scheduled to align with the accrual of [deferred compensation](../d/deferred_compensation.md) liabilities.

## Advantages of Rabbi Trusts

1. **Employee [Assurance](../a/assurance.md)**: Provides employees with confidence that their [deferred compensation](../d/deferred_compensation.md) is set aside and managed within a dedicated [trust](../t/trust.md).
2. **Tax Deferral**: Allows employees to defer [taxation](../t/taxation.md) on earned compensation, thereby potentially benefiting from lower tax rates at the time of actual [distribution](../d/distribution.md).
3. **Retention Tool**: Employers can use Rabbi Trusts strategically to attract and retain key employees by enhancing the perceived [security](../s/security.md) of their [deferred compensation](../d/deferred_compensation.md).
4. **Customization**: The [trust](../t/trust.md) arrangement can be tailored to meet the specific needs of both the employer and employees.

## Disadvantages

1. **Exposure to Employer’s Creditors**: In the case of the employer’s [insolvency](../i/insolvency.md), the [trust](../t/trust.md) assets are accessible to general creditors, which poses a [risk](../r/risk.md) to employees.
2. **Complexity and Cost**: Establishing and maintaining a Rabbi [Trust](../t/trust.md) can involve significant administrative and legal expenses.
3. **Regulatory Scrutiny**: Compliance with IRS guidelines is mandatory and deviations can result in tax penalties and disqualification of the [trust](../t/trust.md) structure.

## Use Cases

Rabbi Trusts are particularly popular in scenarios where firms seek to provide [deferred compensation](../d/deferred_compensation.md) to high-level executives without triggering immediate tax implications. They are also used in situations where employers want to [offer](../o/offer.md) non-qualified [deferred compensation](../d/deferred_compensation.md) plans as a supplementary benefit to highly compensated employees who may hit the contribution limits in qualified plans.

### Real-World Examples

Several large corporations and financial institutions employ Rabbi Trusts to manage [deferred compensation](../d/deferred_compensation.md). For instance, such trusts are often found in the compensation structures of [Fortune 500](../f/fortune_500.md) companies where the aim is to align executives' incentives with long-term company performance.

## Conclusion

In summary, Rabbi Trusts present a unique combination of benefits and risks. They [offer](../o/offer.md) a sophisticated means for firms to provide [deferred compensation](../d/deferred_compensation.md) while helping employees defer [taxes](../t/taxes.md) and [gain](../g/gain.md) [assurance](../a/assurance.md) over their [earnings](../e/earnings.md). However, the exposure to the employer's creditors and the costs involved in administration render them suitable mostly for high-level executives and financially sound companies. Entities considering establishing a Rabbi [Trust](../t/trust.md) must carefully navigate the legal and financial intricacies to ensure both compliance and effectiveness.

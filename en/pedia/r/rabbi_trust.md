# Rabbi Trust

A Rabbi Trust is an irrevocable trust created by an employer to hold and protect deferred compensation for its employees. Named because the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) gave its initial approval to a trust established by a rabbi, the Rabbi Trust primarily serves as a mechanism to provide employees with a degree of security over their deferred compensation. This financial tool is particularly relevant in the context of executive compensation plans, as it helps assure employees that their deferred earnings will be available to them in the event of certain contingencies.

## Legal Framework and Background

Rabbi Trusts owe their legal underpinning to various sections of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and guidance provided by the IRS. Under Revenue Procedure 92-64, key provisions and characteristics of a Rabbi Trust were laid out, providing a standardized template for organizations to follow. These guidelines aim to strike a balance between providing security for employees and not guaranteeing them protection from general creditors in the event of the employer's insolvency—thus keeping the deferred compensation from being considered as "constructively received" and subject to immediate taxation.

### Key Characteristics

1. **Irrevocability**: Once established, the employer cannot unilaterally revoke the trust. This assures employees that the trust’s assets are committed for their benefit.

2. **Controlled Use of Trust Assets**: The assets held within a Rabbi Trust are typically invested and can only be used to pay the deferred compensation or other benefits specified in the trust agreement.

3. **Creditor Exposure**: In the event of the employer’s insolvency, assets in a Rabbi Trust remain subject to the claims of general creditors. This is crucial to ensure that employees are not considered to have “constructive receipt” of the funds and are thus not immediately taxed on the deferred amounts.

4. **Non-qualified Status**: Rabbi Trusts are typically used in non-qualified deferred compensation plans, differentiating them from qualified plans like 401(k)s.

### Structure and Operation

Rabbi Trusts usually involve the following key components:

1. **Grantor**: The employer that establishes the trust.
2. **Trustee**: An appointed individual or entity responsible for managing the trust assets.
3. **Beneficiaries**: Usually, employees or executives entitled to the deferred compensation.
4. **Trust Agreement**: The legal document outlining the terms, conditions, and operational guidelines of the trust.

### Funding

Rabbi Trusts are often funded through a variety of means including cash contributions, corporate stock, or other assets. This funding is usually scheduled to align with the accrual of deferred compensation liabilities.

## Advantages of Rabbi Trusts

1. **Employee Assurance**: Provides employees with confidence that their deferred compensation is set aside and managed within a dedicated trust.
2. **Tax Deferral**: Allows employees to defer taxation on earned compensation, thereby potentially benefiting from lower tax rates at the time of actual distribution.
3. **Retention Tool**: Employers can use Rabbi Trusts strategically to attract and retain key employees by enhancing the perceived security of their deferred compensation.
4. **Customization**: The trust arrangement can be tailored to meet the specific needs of both the employer and employees.

## Disadvantages

1. **Exposure to Employer’s Creditors**: In the case of the employer’s insolvency, the trust assets are accessible to general creditors, which poses a risk to employees.
2. **Complexity and Cost**: Establishing and maintaining a Rabbi Trust can involve significant administrative and legal expenses.
3. **Regulatory Scrutiny**: Compliance with IRS guidelines is mandatory and deviations can result in tax penalties and disqualification of the trust structure.

## Use Cases

Rabbi Trusts are particularly popular in scenarios where firms seek to provide deferred compensation to high-level executives without triggering immediate tax implications. They are also used in situations where employers want to offer non-qualified deferred compensation plans as a supplementary benefit to highly compensated employees who may hit the contribution limits in qualified plans.

### Real-World Examples

Several large corporations and financial institutions employ Rabbi Trusts to manage deferred compensation. For instance, such trusts are often found in the compensation structures of Fortune 500 companies where the aim is to align executives' incentives with long-term company performance.

## Conclusion

In summary, Rabbi Trusts present a unique combination of benefits and risks. They offer a sophisticated means for firms to provide deferred compensation while helping employees defer taxes and gain assurance over their earnings. However, the exposure to the employer's creditors and the costs involved in administration render them suitable mostly for high-level executives and financially sound companies. Entities considering establishing a Rabbi Trust must carefully navigate the legal and financial intricacies to ensure both compliance and effectiveness.

# Reserve Ratio

The reserve ratio, also known as the cash reserve ratio (CRR), is a central [bank](../b/bank.md) regulation used by various countries to set the minimum fraction of [customer](../c/customer.md) deposits and notes that each [commercial bank](../c/commercial_bank.md) must [hold](../h/hold.md) as reserves (rather than lend out). These reserves are customarily held in the form of vault cash or deposits with the central [bank](../b/bank.md). The reserve ratio is a critical component of the banking system and [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) as it directly impacts the amount of [money](../m/money.md) that banks can create through lending.

## Importance and Function

The reserve ratio is a tool used by central banks to control [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), [credit](../c/credit.md) [supply](../s/supply.md), and overall economic stability. By adjusting the reserve ratio, central banks can influence the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) and economic activity:

1. **Economic Stability:** A higher reserve ratio means banks have less [money](../m/money.md) to lend out, reducing the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md) and cooling off an [overheated economy](../o/overheated_economy.md). Conversely, a lower reserve ratio increases the [money supply](../m/money_supply.md), which can help stimulate an [economy](../e/economy.md) during a [recession](../r/recession.md).

2. **[Credit](../c/credit.md) Control:** By controlling the amount banks can lend, the central [bank](../b/bank.md) can manage [inflation](../i/inflation.md) and ensure that the [economy](../e/economy.md) does not overheat. 

3. **Confidence in the Banking System:** The reserve ratio ensures that banks have enough [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) to meet [customer](../c/customer.md) withdrawals, which helps maintain public confidence in the banking system.

## Mechanics of the Reserve Ratio

### Required Reserve Ratio

The required reserve ratio is the legally mandated percentage of deposits that banks must [hold](../h/hold.md) as reserves. This ratio can vary depending on the type of [deposit](../d/deposit.md) (e.g., [demand](../d/demand.md) deposits vs. time deposits), the size of the [bank](../b/bank.md), and the regulatory framework of the country.

### Excess Reserves

Banks often [hold](../h/hold.md) more reserves than required. The amount exceeding the required reserves is known as [excess reserves](../e/excess_reserves.md). While holding [excess reserves](../e/excess_reserves.md) can be seen as a safety measure, it means that the [bank](../b/bank.md) is not maximizing its potential to earn [interest](../i/interest.md) from loans.

### Reserve Calculation

The reserve ratio impacts the [money](../m/money.md) creation process through the [money](../m/money.md) [multiplier effect](../m/multiplier_effect.md). The [money](../m/money.md) [multiplier](../m/multiplier.md) (m) is defined as:

\[ m = \frac{1}{RR} \]

where RR is the reserve ratio. For example, if the reserve ratio is 10%, the [money](../m/money.md) [multiplier](../m/multiplier.md) is 10 (1/0.10). This means that every dollar of reserves can support $10 of deposits, thus amplifying the amount of [money](../m/money.md) in the [economy](../e/economy.md).

### Example

Consider a [bank](../b/bank.md) with $100 million of [customer](../c/customer.md) deposits and a 10% reserve ratio. The [bank](../b/bank.md) must [hold](../h/hold.md) $10 million in reserves and can lend out the remaining $90 million. If the reserve ratio is increased to 20%, the [bank](../b/bank.md) would need to [hold](../h/hold.md) $20 million in reserves and could only lend out $80 million.

## Global Perspectives

### United States

In the United States, the Federal Reserve (often referred to as the Fed) sets the [reserve requirements](../r/reserve_requirements.md). These requirements have varied over time and can differ based on the amount of deposits a [bank](../b/bank.md) holds. The Fed uses the reserve ratio alongside other tools like the [discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md) and [open market operations](../o/open_market_operations.md) to regulate [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md).

### European Union

In the [European Union](../e/european_union_(eu).md), the European Central [Bank](../b/bank.md) (ECB) sets minimum [reserve requirements](../r/reserve_requirements.md) for banks in the [Eurozone](../e/eurozone.md). The ECB has often used these requirements more flexibly compared to other central banks, focusing heavily on [open market operations](../o/open_market_operations.md) to manage [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md).

### China

China's central [bank](../b/bank.md), the People's [Bank](../b/bank.md) of China (PBOC), frequently adjusts the reserve ratio to control [credit](../c/credit.md) growth and stabilize the [economy](../e/economy.md). In recent years, the PBOC has used both increases and decreases in the reserve ratio to manage economic fluctuations and curb excessive lending.

## Modern Trends and Perspectives

In the modern banking environment, some countries are moving towards a more flexible approach to [reserve requirements](../r/reserve_requirements.md). This shift reflects changes in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and the evolution of banking technology:

1. **Zero Reserve Requirement:** Some central banks, like the [Bank](../b/bank.md) of Canada and the Reserve [Bank](../b/bank.md) of New Zealand, have adopted a zero-reserve requirement policy, relying instead on [market](../m/market.md)-based mechanisms to maintain financial stability.

2. **Technological Innovations:** With advancements in banking technology, real-time [payment](../p/payment.md) systems, and digital currencies, the traditional role of the reserve ratio may evolve. Central banks are exploring new ways to ensure [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and manage [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) effectively.

3. **Financial Regulations:** Post-2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) regulations like [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md) have introduced new [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) requirements, such as the [Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) [Coverage Ratio](../c/coverage_ratio.md) (LCR), which [complement](../c/complement.md) traditional [reserve requirements](../r/reserve_requirements.md) to ensure [bank](../b/bank.md) stability.

## Challenges and Criticisms

Despite its importance, the reserve ratio is not without challenges and criticisms:

1. **Economic Distortion:** Critics argue that changes in the reserve ratio can lead to distortions in the lending behavior of banks, sometimes creating unintended economic consequences.

2. **Global Coordination:** As [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) become more interconnected, coordination between central banks on [reserve requirements](../r/reserve_requirements.md) becomes crucial but challenging.

3. **Administrative Burden:** Maintaining and monitoring compliance with [reserve requirements](../r/reserve_requirements.md) can be an administrative burden for both banks and regulators.

4. **Impact on Profitability:** High reserve ratios can impact [bank](../b/bank.md) profitability as they reduce the funds available for lending, which is a primary source of [income](../i/income.md) for banks.

## Conclusion

The reserve ratio remains a foundational element of modern banking and [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md). By influencing the amount of [money](../m/money.md) banks can create through lending, the reserve ratio plays a critical role in ensuring economic stability, controlling [inflation](../i/inflation.md), and maintaining confidence in the banking system. As [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and technologies evolve, so too may the approaches to setting and implementing [reserve requirements](../r/reserve_requirements.md), ensuring they remain effective in a changing economic landscape.

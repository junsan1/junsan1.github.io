# Restricted Stock

Restricted Stock refers to [shares](../s/shares.md) of a company that are not fully transferable until certain conditions have been met, or restrictions have been lifted. These [stocks](../s/stock.md) are often granted to company executives as a part of their compensation package, subject to various [vesting](../v/vesting.md) schedules and forfeiture conditions. Given their nature, understanding restricted stock is crucial for both recipients and investors, [offering](../o/offering.md) insights into [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md), compensation practices, and tax implications.

## What is Restricted Stock?

Restricted Stock is commonly issued to employees, typically executives, as part of their incentive and compensation plans. These [stocks](../s/stock.md) come with limitations on their [sale](../s/sale.md) or transfer and are subject to forfeiture if specific conditions are not met. These conditions may include a time-based [vesting](../v/vesting.md) schedule or performance-based criteria, crafting a sense of ownership while ensuring the achievement of targeted company goals.

Restricted Stock can be divided into two main categories:
1. **Restricted Stock Awards (RSAs)**: These are granted outright and the recipient has ownership even before they vest, though the [shares](../s/shares.md) cannot be sold until they do vest.
2. **Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)**: A promise to deliver [shares](../s/shares.md) or their cash equivalent at some future date conditioned upon the [vesting](../v/vesting.md) schedule.

## Vesting Schedules and Restrictions

[Vesting](../v/vesting.md) schedules delineate the timeframe over which the recipient gains full ownership of the restricted stock. There are generally two types of [vesting](../v/vesting.md) schedules:
1. **Time-based [vesting](../v/vesting.md)**: The stock vests over a set period, such as monthly or annually, often to boost employee retention.
2. **Performance-based [vesting](../v/vesting.md)**: The stock vests upon meeting specific [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md), aligning management interests with [business](../b/business.md) goals.

For example, a time-based [vesting](../v/vesting.md) schedule may [grant](../g/grant.md) 25% of the restricted stock each year over four years. Performance-based plans might specify [vesting](../v/vesting.md) only if certain [revenue](../r/revenue.md) or [profit](../p/profit.md) targets are met.

Restrictions often placed on these [stocks](../s/stock.md) include:
- *Selling [shares](../s/shares.md)*: Until [shares](../s/shares.md) vest, [options](../o/options.md) for selling are limited or prohibited.
- *Forfeiture*: If an employee leaves the company before the [shares](../s/shares.md) vest, the unvested [shares](../s/shares.md) are typically forfeited.

## Benefits and Drawbacks

### Benefits

1. **Retention Tool**: By requiring employees to stay with the company for a certain period to [gain](../g/gain.md) full ownership, restricted stock serves as a powerful retention tool.
2. **Performance Alignment**: Linking stock awards to [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md) aligns the interests of employees with [shareholder value](../s/shareholder_value.md) creation.
3. **Motivation & Morale**: Granting ownership stakes can boost morale and motivate employees as they have a more significant personal investment in the company's success.

### Drawbacks

1. **[Liquidity Risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md)**: Employees may face [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) issues as the [stocks](../s/stock.md) cannot be sold until vested.
2. **[Market Risk](../m/market_risk.md)**: The [value](../v/value.md) of restricted stock is tied to the company’s stock performance, which can be volatile.
3. **Tax Implications**: The tax treatment can be complex, often requiring careful planning to minimize tax liabilities.

## Tax Implications

The tax treatment of restricted stock can be intricate, and it varies depending on several factors including the [vesting](../v/vesting.md) schedule and whether the recipient makes an [83(b) election](../1/83(b)_election.md):

### Standard Tax Treatment

Typically, recipients are not taxed at the time of the award but are taxed as [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md) once the stock vests and the restrictions [lapse](../l/lapse.md). The taxable amount is the fair [market value](../m/market_value.md) of the stock at [vesting](../v/vesting.md).

### 83(b) Election

The IRC Section [83(b) election](../1/83(b)_election.md) allows employees to be taxed at the time of the award rather than at [vesting](../v/vesting.md). If the stock increases in [value](../v/value.md) over time, this could significantly reduce the amount of [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md). However, if the stock decreases in [value](../v/value.md) or forfeiture occurs, it doesn't permit [reversal](../r/reversal.md) of the tax paid:

1. **Advantages**: The primary benefit is that future appreciation of stock is taxed at the [capital gains tax](../c/capital_gains_tax.md) rate rather than [ordinary income](../o/ordinary_income.md) tax rates.
2. **Risks**: If the stock forfeits, the tax paid is not recoverable, and if the stock decreases in [value](../v/value.md), the recipient still pays tax based on the higher initial [valuation](../v/valuation.md).

### Example Calculation for 83(b) Election

Imagine an employee receives 1,000 [shares](../s/shares.md) of restricted stock valued at $10 per share:
- **Without [83(b) Election](../1/83(b)_election.md)**: No initial tax; if the stock appreciates to $30 at [vesting](../v/vesting.md), [income](../i/income.md) taxed [will](../w/will.md) be $30,000.
- **With [83(b) Election](../1/83(b)_election.md)**: Immediate tax on $10,000; if the stock appreciates, gains are taxed as [capital](../c/capital.md) gains.

## Corporate Governance and Proxy Statements

The use of restricted stock is often outlined in the company’s [proxy](../p/proxy.md) statements, reflecting [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) practices and [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) interests. These documents detail essential aspects such as:
- **[Equity Compensation](../e/equity_compensation.md) Plans**: Shareholders must approve the plan authorizing the restricted stock.
- **Executive Compensation**: Restricted stock awards to top executives are disclosed for [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and accountability.

For instance, companies must file [proxy](../p/proxy.md) statements (Form DEF 14A) with the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC), providing comprehensive information on restricted stock awards. Websites like https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html [offer](../o/offer.md) access to such filings.

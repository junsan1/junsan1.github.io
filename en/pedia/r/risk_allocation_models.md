# Risk Allocation Models

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), often termed "algo trading," leverages computer algorithms to automate trading decisions and executions. One crucial aspect in this field is risk allocationâ€”deciding how to distribute risk across different assets, strategies, or portfolios. Effective risk allocation models help in maximizing returns while minimizing potential losses. This article provides a comprehensive overview of various risk allocation models used in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md).

## 1. Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)
Modern Portfolio Theory, introduced by Harry Markowitz in 1952, is a fundamental concept in risk allocation. The theory emphasizes the diversification of investments to achieve an optimal balance between risk and return.

### Key Concepts:
- **[Efficient Frontier](../e/efficient_frontier.md)**: The set of optimal portfolios offering the highest expected return for a given level of risk.
- **[Risk-Return Tradeoff](../r/risk-return_tradeoff.md)**: The idea that to achieve higher returns, an investor must accept higher risk.
- **[Portfolio Diversification](../p/portfolio_diversification.md)**: Spreading investments across various assets to reduce risk.

### Application in Algorithmic Trading:
In [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), MPT principles can guide the selection and weighting of assets in a portfolio to achieve desired risk and return profiles. Algorithms can continuously rebalance portfolios to maintain alignment with the [efficient frontier](../e/efficient_frontier.md). 

## 2. Value at Risk (VaR)
Value at Risk is a statistical technique used to measure and quantify the level of financial risk within a portfolio over a specific timeframe. VaR calculates the maximum potential loss with a given confidence level.

### Key Metrics:
- **Confidence Level**: Typically set at 95% or 99%, indicating the probability that losses will not exceed the calculated VaR.
- **Time Horizon**: The period over which risk is assessed, often one day, one month, or one year.

### Application in Algo Trading:
VaR helps algorithmic traders to set risk limits and monitor exposure. By integrating VaR into [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md), traders can control the risk level and adjust [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) proactively.

## 3. Tail Risk Parity
Tail [Risk Parity](../r/risk_parity.md) focuses on balancing the risk contributions of different assets, particularly in extreme market conditions. Unlike traditional [risk parity](../r/risk_parity.md), which equalizes risk contributions based on standard deviations, tail [risk parity](../r/risk_parity.md) considers potential losses in the tails of the distribution.

### Key Concepts:
- **[Tail Risk](../t/tail_risk.md)**: The risk of extreme events that have a low probability but a high impact on [portfolio performance](../p/portfolio_performance.md).
- **Risk Contributions**: Each asset's potential to impact the overall portfolio during extreme market conditions.

### Application:
In algo trading, tail [risk parity](../r/risk_parity.md) models help create more resilient portfolios by ensuring that no single asset disproportionately contributes to potential extreme losses. Algorithms can dynamically adjust asset weights to maintain balanced [tail risk](../t/tail_risk.md) exposure.

## 4. Risk Parity
[Risk Parity](../r/risk_parity.md) is a portfolio allocation strategy that focuses on equalizing the risk contribution of each asset or asset class in a portfolio, rather than equalizing [capital allocation](../c/capital_allocation.md).

### Key Concepts:
- **Risk Contribution**: The proportion of total portfolio risk attributed to each asset.
- **Leverage**: Often used to scale the overall risk of the portfolio to meet desired risk levels.

### Application:
[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) systems incorporate [risk parity](../r/risk_parity.md) to build balanced portfolios that are less sensitive to market volatility. Algorithms adjust holdings to ensure that each asset contributes equally to the overall portfolio risk.

## 5. Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)
Also known as Expected Shortfall, CVaR provides an estimate of the expected losses exceeding the VaR threshold. CVaR offers a more comprehensive risk measure by considering the tail end of the [loss distribution](../l/loss_distribution.md).

### Key Metrics:
- **CVaR Level**: The conditional average losses beyond the VaR cutoff, usually calculated at the same confidence level as VaR.

### Application:
In algo trading, CVaR can enhance [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) by providing a deeper understanding of potential extreme losses. Algorithms utilizing CVaR can adjust positions to mitigate higher-order risks and improve overall portfolio resilience.

## 6. Kelly Criterion
The [Kelly Criterion](../k/kelly_criterion.md) is a formula used to determine the optimal size of a series of bets to maximize the logarithm of wealth over time. It balances the tradeoff between risk and reward, aiming to maximize long-term growth.

### Key Formula:
- **Kelly Fraction**: \( f^* = \frac{bp - q}{b} \)
  - **b**: Odds received on the bet.
  - **p**: Probability of winning.
  - **q**: Probability of losing (\( q = 1 - p \)).

### Application:
In [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), the [Kelly Criterion](../k/kelly_criterion.md) can be used to size trades optimally. [Trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) can integrate the Kelly fraction to dynamically adjust trade sizes based on assessed probabilities of success.

## 7. Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO)
[Mean-Variance Optimization](../m/mean-variance_optimization.md) is another investment strategy derived from Modern Portfolio Theory. It involves selecting a portfolio that maximizes expected return for a given level of risk or minimizes risk for a given level of expected return.

### Key Concepts:
- **Expected Return**: The weighted average of the expected returns of the assets.
- **Portfolio Variance**: The measure of risk based on the variance and covariance of asset returns.

### Application:
Algo-[trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md) use MVO to construct portfolios that align with specific risk-return objectives. Algorithms consider historical data and forecasts to continuously optimize asset weights.

## 8. Black-Litterman Model
The [Black-Litterman model](../b/black-litterman_model.md) is an extension of the Markowitz model, incorporating investor views into the [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) process. This model combines market equilibrium with subjective opinions to produce a unique, optimized portfolio.

### Key Components:
- **Market Equilibrium**: Starting point based on the capital market line.
- **Investor Views**: Adjustments to reflect opinions on asset returns.

### Application:
Algo trading platforms can use the [Black-Litterman model](../b/black-litterman_model.md) to generate bespoke portfolios that integrate both market data and trader insights. Algorithms adapt asset weights based on updated views and market conditions.

## 9. Dynamic Risk Budgeting
Dynamic [Risk Budgeting](../r/risk_budgeting.md) involves setting and adjusting risk limits actively based on changing market conditions and [portfolio performance](../p/portfolio_performance.md). This model ensures that risk levels remain within predefined thresholds.

### Key Aspects:
- **Risk Limits**: Predefined acceptable risk levels for the portfolio.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Continuous monitoring and adjustment of risk limits based on [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md).

### Application:
Algorithmic systems leveraging dynamic [risk budgeting](../r/risk_budgeting.md) can react swiftly to market changes. By dynamically adjusting positions and risk limits, these systems maintain optimal risk exposure in real-time.

## 10. Stochastic Control Models
[Stochastic Control](../s/stochastic_control.md) Models use mathematical techniques to make sequential decisions in uncertain environments. These models consider the stochastic nature of asset prices and help in formulating optimal [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

### Key Techniques:
- **Bellman Equation**: Fundamental to dynamic programming, assisting in decision making under uncertainty.
- **Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) Equation**: Used for continuous-time optimization problems.

### Application:
[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) strategies based on [stochastic control](../s/stochastic_control.md) models can optimize decision-making processes over time. These models consider the randomness in market prices to generate adaptive [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

# Risk Allocation Models

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), often termed "algo trading," leverages computer algorithms to automate trading decisions and executions. One crucial aspect in this field is [risk](../r/risk.md) allocationâ€”deciding how to distribute [risk](../r/risk.md) across different assets, strategies, or portfolios. Effective [risk](../r/risk.md) allocation models help in maximizing returns while minimizing potential losses. This article provides a comprehensive overview of various [risk](../r/risk.md) allocation models used in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md).

## 1. Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)
Modern Portfolio Theory, introduced by [Harry Markowitz](../h/harry_markowitz.md) in 1952, is a fundamental concept in [risk](../r/risk.md) allocation. The theory emphasizes the [diversification](../d/diversification.md) of investments to achieve an optimal balance between [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md).

### Key Concepts:
- **[Efficient Frontier](../e/efficient_frontier.md)**: The set of optimal portfolios [offering](../o/offering.md) the highest [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) for a given level of [risk](../r/risk.md).
- **[Risk-Return Tradeoff](../r/risk-return_tradeoff.md)**: The idea that to achieve higher returns, an [investor](../i/investor.md) must accept higher [risk](../r/risk.md).
- **[Portfolio Diversification](../p/portfolio_diversification.md)**: Spreading investments across various assets to reduce [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Application in Algorithmic Trading:
In [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), MPT principles can guide the selection and weighting of assets in a portfolio to achieve desired [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md) profiles. Algorithms can continuously rebalance portfolios to maintain alignment with the [efficient frontier](../e/efficient_frontier.md). 

## 2. Value at Risk (VaR)
[Value](../v/value.md) at [Risk](../r/risk.md) is a statistical technique used to measure and quantify the level of [financial risk](../f/financial_risk.md) within a portfolio over a specific timeframe. VaR calculates the maximum potential loss with a given confidence level.

### Key Metrics:
- **Confidence Level**: Typically set at 95% or 99%, indicating the probability that losses [will](../w/will.md) not exceed the calculated VaR.
- **[Time Horizon](../t/time_horizon.md)**: The period over which [risk](../r/risk.md) is assessed, often one day, one month, or one year.

### Application in Algo Trading:
VaR helps algorithmic traders to set [risk](../r/risk.md) limits and monitor exposure. By integrating VaR into [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md), traders can control the [risk](../r/risk.md) level and adjust [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) proactively.

## 3. Tail Risk Parity
Tail [Risk Parity](../r/risk_parity.md) focuses on balancing the [risk](../r/risk.md) contributions of different assets, particularly in extreme [market](../m/market.md) conditions. Unlike traditional [risk parity](../r/risk_parity.md), which equalizes [risk](../r/risk.md) contributions based on standard deviations, tail [risk parity](../r/risk_parity.md) considers potential losses in the tails of the [distribution](../d/distribution.md).

### Key Concepts:
- **[Tail Risk](../t/tail_risk.md)**: The [risk](../r/risk.md) of extreme events that have a low probability but a high impact on [portfolio performance](../p/portfolio_performance.md).
- **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Contributions**: Each [asset](../a/asset.md)'s potential to impact the overall portfolio during extreme [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

### Application:
In algo trading, tail [risk parity](../r/risk_parity.md) models help create more resilient portfolios by ensuring that no single [asset](../a/asset.md) disproportionately contributes to potential extreme losses. Algorithms can dynamically adjust [asset](../a/asset.md) weights to maintain balanced [tail risk](../t/tail_risk.md) exposure.

## 4. Risk Parity
[Risk Parity](../r/risk_parity.md) is a portfolio allocation strategy that focuses on equalizing the [risk](../r/risk.md) contribution of each [asset](../a/asset.md) or [asset class](../a/asset_class.md) in a portfolio, rather than equalizing [capital allocation](../c/capital_allocation.md).

### Key Concepts:
- **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Contribution**: The proportion of total portfolio [risk](../r/risk.md) attributed to each [asset](../a/asset.md).
- **[Leverage](../l/leverage.md)**: Often used to scale the overall [risk](../r/risk.md) of the portfolio to meet desired [risk](../r/risk.md) levels.

### Application:
[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) systems incorporate [risk parity](../r/risk_parity.md) to build balanced portfolios that are less sensitive to [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md). Algorithms adjust [holdings](../h/holdings.md) to ensure that each [asset](../a/asset.md) contributes equally to the overall portfolio [risk](../r/risk.md).

## 5. Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)
Also known as Expected [Shortfall](../s/shortfall.md), CVaR provides an estimate of the expected losses exceeding the VaR threshold. CVaR offers a more comprehensive [risk](../r/risk.md) measure by considering the tail end of the [loss distribution](../l/loss_distribution.md).

### Key Metrics:
- **CVaR Level**: The conditional average losses beyond the VaR cutoff, usually calculated at the same confidence level as VaR.

### Application:
In algo trading, CVaR can enhance [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) by providing a deeper understanding of potential extreme losses. Algorithms utilizing CVaR can adjust positions to mitigate higher-[order](../o/order.md) risks and improve overall portfolio resilience.

## 6. Kelly Criterion
The [Kelly Criterion](../k/kelly_criterion.md) is a formula used to determine the optimal size of a series of bets to maximize the logarithm of [wealth](../w/wealth.md) over time. It balances the tradeoff between [risk](../r/risk.md) and reward, aiming to maximize long-term growth.

### Key Formula:
- **Kelly Fraction**: \( f^* = \frac{bp - q}{b} \)
  - **b**: Odds received on the bet.
  - **p**: Probability of winning.
  - **q**: Probability of losing (\( q = 1 - p \)).

### Application:
In [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), the [Kelly Criterion](../k/kelly_criterion.md) can be used to size trades optimally. [Trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) can integrate the Kelly fraction to dynamically adjust [trade](../t/trade.md) sizes based on assessed probabilities of success.

## 7. Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO)
[Mean-Variance Optimization](../m/mean-variance_optimization.md) is another [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) derived from Modern Portfolio Theory. It involves selecting a portfolio that maximizes [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) for a given level of [risk](../r/risk.md) or minimizes [risk](../r/risk.md) for a given level of [expected return](../e/expected_return.md).

### Key Concepts:
- **[Expected Return](../e/expected_return.md)**: The [weighted average](../w/weighted_average.md) of the expected returns of the assets.
- **[Portfolio Variance](../p/portfolio_variance.md)**: The measure of [risk](../r/risk.md) based on the variance and [covariance](../c/covariance.md) of [asset](../a/asset.md) returns.

### Application:
Algo-[trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md) use MVO to construct portfolios that align with specific [risk](../r/risk.md)-[return](../r/return.md) objectives. Algorithms consider historical data and forecasts to continuously optimize [asset](../a/asset.md) weights.

## 8. Black-Litterman Model
The [Black-Litterman model](../b/black-litterman_model.md) is an extension of the Markowitz model, incorporating [investor](../i/investor.md) views into the [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md) process. This model combines [market](../m/market.md) [equilibrium](../e/equilibrium.md) with subjective opinions to produce a unique, optimized portfolio.

### Key Components:
- **[Market](../m/market.md) [Equilibrium](../e/equilibrium.md)**: Starting point based on the [capital](../c/capital.md) [market](../m/market.md) line.
- **[Investor](../i/investor.md) Views**: Adjustments to reflect opinions on [asset](../a/asset.md) returns.

### Application:
Algo trading platforms can use the [Black-Litterman model](../b/black-litterman_model.md) to generate bespoke portfolios that integrate both [market](../m/market.md) data and [trader](../t/trader.md) insights. Algorithms adapt [asset](../a/asset.md) weights based on updated views and [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

## 9. Dynamic Risk Budgeting
Dynamic [Risk Budgeting](../r/risk_budgeting.md) involves setting and adjusting [risk](../r/risk.md) limits actively based on changing [market](../m/market.md) conditions and [portfolio performance](../p/portfolio_performance.md). This model ensures that [risk](../r/risk.md) levels remain within predefined thresholds.

### Key Aspects:
- **[Risk](../r/risk.md) Limits**: Predefined acceptable [risk](../r/risk.md) levels for the portfolio.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Continuous monitoring and adjustment of [risk](../r/risk.md) limits based on [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md).

### Application:
Algorithmic systems leveraging dynamic [risk budgeting](../r/risk_budgeting.md) can react swiftly to [market](../m/market.md) changes. By dynamically adjusting positions and [risk](../r/risk.md) limits, these systems maintain optimal [risk](../r/risk.md) exposure in real-time.

## 10. Stochastic Control Models
[Stochastic Control](../s/stochastic_control.md) Models use mathematical techniques to make sequential decisions in uncertain environments. These models consider the stochastic nature of [asset](../a/asset.md) prices and help in formulating optimal [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

### Key Techniques:
- **Bellman Equation**: Fundamental to [dynamic programming](../d/dynamic_programming_in_trading.md), assisting in decision making under [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md).
- **Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) Equation**: Used for continuous-time [optimization](../o/optimization.md) problems.

### Application:
[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) strategies based on [stochastic control](../s/stochastic_control.md) models can optimize decision-making processes over time. These models consider the randomness in [market](../m/market.md) prices to generate adaptive [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

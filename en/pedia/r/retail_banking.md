# Retail Banking

Retail banking, also known as consumer banking or personal banking, is the [provision](../p/provision.md) of services by a [bank](../b/bank.md) to individual consumers, rather than to companies or other banks. Services offered include savings and checking accounts, mortgages, personal loans, [debit](../d/debit.md) and [credit](../c/credit.md) cards, as well as certificates of [deposit](../d/deposit.md) (CDs). Retail banking is the visible face of banking to the general public, as it encompasses services provided by local branches and [online banking](../o/online_banking.md) platforms.

### Key Services Offered in Retail Banking

1. **Savings Accounts**: These accounts are designed to help individuals save [money](../m/money.md) while earning [interest](../i/interest.md) on their deposits. [Interest](../i/interest.md) rates for savings accounts are typically lower than other investment [options](../o/options.md), but they provide [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and safety of the [principal](../p/principal.md) amount.

2. **Checking Accounts**: These accounts are used for day-to-day transactions. They [offer](../o/offer.md) features such as [check](../c/check.md)-writing capabilities, [debit](../d/debit.md) card access, and online bill pay. Checking accounts usually do not [offer](../o/offer.md) high-[interest](../i/interest.md) rates as they are designed for frequent and immediate access to funds.

3. **Mortgages**: Retail banks [offer](../o/offer.md) different types of [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) loans to help consumers buy homes. This includes fixed-rate mortgages, adjustable-rate mortgages, and [interest](../i/interest.md)-only loans. Mortgages are long-term loans that can span up to 30 years or more, with the [home](../h/home.md) serving as [collateral](../c/collateral.md).

4. **Personal Loans**: These unsecured loans can be used for various personal expenses such as [home](../h/home.md) renovation, medical bills, or [debt consolidation](../d/debt_consolidation.md). [Interest](../i/interest.md) rates and terms can vary widely based on the individual's [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md).

5. **[Credit](../c/credit.md) Cards**: [Credit](../c/credit.md) cards allow consumers to borrow [money](../m/money.md) up to a certain limit. They come with features such as [cash back](../c/cash_back.md), rewards points, and balance transfer [options](../o/options.md). [Interest](../i/interest.md) rates on [credit](../c/credit.md) cards are usually higher compared to other [loan](../l/loan.md) types.

6. **Certificates of [Deposit](../d/deposit.md) (CDs)**: CDs are time-[deposit](../d/deposit.md) accounts that [offer](../o/offer.md) higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates than regular savings accounts. In [return](../r/return.md), consumers commit to leaving the [money](../m/money.md) in the account for a set term, which can [range](../r/range.md) from a few months to several years.

7. **Investment Products**: Many retail banks [offer](../o/offer.md) investment products such as mutual funds, retirement accounts, and [brokerage services](../b/brokerage_services.md). These services may be provided directly by the [bank](../b/bank.md) or through affiliated financial advisors.

5. **[Blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) and Cryptocurrencies**: Some retail banks are exploring the use of [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) for more secure and efficient transactions. Additionally, cryptocurrency services are increasingly being integrated into traditional banking offerings.

6. **[Data Analytics](../d/data_analytics.md) and Personalization**: Banks employ advanced [data analytics](../d/data_analytics.md) to [gain](../g/gain.md) insights into [customer](../c/customer.md) behavior and preferences.

### Regulatory Environment

5. **Economic [Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: Economic downturns can affect [loan](../l/loan.md) performance and profitability, leading to increased [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) and lower [income](../i/income.md) from lending operations.

# Holder of Record

The term "Holder of Record" is fundamental in the world of [finance](../f/finance.md), particularly in the context of [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) management and [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md). It refers to the individual or entity registered as the owner of securities by the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) of those securities. The Holder of Record is logged officially in the company's books on a specific date, which is often referred to as the "[record date](../r/record_date.md)." This concept has a significant impact on various corporate actions, such as the [payment](../p/payment.md) of dividends, the issuance of new [shares](../s/shares.md), and voting at [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) meetings.

## Understanding the Holder of Record

Incorporated companies [issue](../i/issue.md) securities to investors, who can buy or sell these securities in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). However, there may be many layers between the issuing company and the final [investor](../i/investor.md), such as brokers and clearinghouses. The Holder of Record is the name that appears in the issuing company’s official records, indicating ownership of the [shares](../s/shares.md) or bonds. This may not always be the actual [beneficial owner](../b/beneficial_owner.md), i.e., the person who ultimately has the economic [interest](../i/interest.md) in the securities, but could be an intermediary like a [broker](../b/broker.md).

### Importance of the Holder of Record

The primary importance of identifying the Holder of Record lies in determining who is entitled to receive dividends, participate in mergers and acquisitions, vote in [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) meetings, and enjoy other benefits tied to owning a share of the company. 

1. **[Dividend](../d/dividend.md) Payments**: When a company declares a [dividend](../d/dividend.md), it needs to know who the current shareholders are to distribute dividends effectively. The Holder of Record, as noted on the [record date](../r/record_date.md), [will](../w/will.md) be entitled to receive the declared dividends.

2. **Voting Rights**: Shareholders are often required to vote on crucial company matters such as electing board members, approving mergers, or other significant changes. Only those identified as Holders of Record by the [record date](../r/record_date.md) are eligible to cast votes.

3. **Rights Issues and [Capital](../c/capital.md) Increases**: Companies may [issue](../i/issue.md) more [shares](../s/shares.md) or [offer](../o/offer.md) rights to existing shareholders to buy additional [shares](../s/shares.md) at a [discount](../d/discount.md). The benefits [will](../w/will.md) typically be extended to the Holder of Record.

4. **Corporate Actions**: In the event of corporate actions such as stock splits, [reverse stock splits](../r/reverse_stock_splits.md), or mergers, the Holder of Record [will](../w/will.md) be the point of contact for executing these changes.

## Record Date

The [record date](../r/record_date.md) is a cut-off date established by a company to determine which shareholders are eligible to receive dividends, attend [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) meetings, or participate in other corporate actions. This date is critical because securities might change hands between investors constantly, and the [record date](../r/record_date.md) ensures clarity regarding ownership at a specific point in time. For example, if a company schedules a [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) meeting for June 30th and sets a [record date](../r/record_date.md) for June 1st, only those individuals or entities [listed](../l/listed.md) as Holders of Record as of June 1st [will](../w/will.md) be allowed to participate or vote at the meeting.

## Beneficial Owner vs. Holder of Record

While the Holder of Record is the name [listed](../l/listed.md) in the [issuer](../i/issuer.md)'s books, the actual, or "beneficial", owner might be different. The [beneficial owner](../b/beneficial_owner.md) is the person or entity that enjoys the ultimate benefits of ownership even though the title might be in another name, often for ease of trading or holding. 

1. **[Broker](../b/broker.md)-Dealers and Nominees**: Institutional investors such as mutual funds, pension funds, and other large entities often [hold](../h/hold.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) and bonds through [broker](../b/broker.md)-dealers or nominees. Even though the [broker](../b/broker.md) or nominee is the Holder of Record, the beneficial owners are the clients of these brokers or institutions.

2. **Custodial Services**: Custodians act on behalf of investors, holding securities in their own name (as the Holder of Record) while the investors remain the beneficial owners. This service is common in [depository](../d/depository.md) systems like those in [Euroclear](../e/euroclear.md) or the [Depository](../d/depository.md) [Trust Company](../t/trust_company.md) (DTC).

## Transfer Agents

Transfer agents play a crucial role in maintaining accurate and updated records of Holders of Record. They act as intermediaries for the issuing company, handling changes in ownership, [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of dividends, and other administrative tasks. Companies like [Computershare](https://www.computershare.com) and [American Stock Transfer & Trust Company (AST)](https://www.astfinancial.com) are well-known transfer agents providing these services.

### Functions of Transfer Agents

- **Maintaining Records**: Ensuring the company’s list of registered shareholders is accurate and up-to-date.
- **[Transaction](../t/transaction.md) Management**: Handling the transfer of securities when [shares](../s/shares.md) are bought or sold.
- **[Dividend](../d/dividend.md) [Distribution](../d/distribution.md)**: Ensuring dividends are accurately calculated and distributed to the Holders of Record.
- **Corporate Actions**: Managing other corporate actions such as stock splits, mergers, and rights offerings.

## Legal Implications and Regulatory Framework

The concept of the Holder of Record is subject to various regulatory requirements. In the United States, for instance, the role and responsibilities of Holders of Record, along with [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md), are governed by regulations from the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC). 

1. **[Securities Act of 1933](../s/securities_act_of_1933.md) and [Securities Exchange Act of 1934](../s/securities_exchange_act_of_1934.md)**: These foundational pieces of legislation outline the requirements for companies to register securities and maintain accurate records of holders.
2. **Sarbanes-Oxley Act**: Enacted in response to corporate scandals, this act enhances the accountability of companies, pushing for accurate record-keeping and more transparent corporate actions.

## Challenges and Considerations

While the concept seems straightforward, several challenges complicate the identification and management of Holders of Record:

1. **Intermediaries**: The presence of [multiple](../m/multiple.md) intermediaries between the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) and [beneficial owner](../b/beneficial_owner.md) can complicate the accurate identification of Holders of Record.
2. **Cross-Border [Holdings](../h/holdings.md)**: Securities held in international markets may involve diverse regulatory environments and practices, adding complexity to record-keeping.
3. **Technological Systems**: The reliance on technology and software solutions for maintaining records introduces risks related to cyber-[security](../s/security.md), data integrity, and system failures.

### Solutions and Best Practices

- **[Blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) Technology**: The adoption of [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) and distributed ledger technologies can provide more transparent and tamper-proof records.
- **Standardization**: Initiatives to standardize record-keeping and reporting practices on an international scale can help mitigate discrepancies and inefficiencies.
- **Enhanced Cybersecurity**: Investment in [robust](../r/robust.md) cybersecurity protocols to protect sensitive [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) information.

## Conclusion

The Holder of Record is a critical concept in securities markets, playing an essential role in [dividend](../d/dividend.md) [distribution](../d/distribution.md), voting, corporate actions, and overall [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md). Understanding and accurately managing Holders of Record ensures compliance with regulatory requirements and effective communication with shareholders. As markets evolve, the methods and technologies used to track and manage Holders of Record [will](../w/will.md) likely continue to advance, addressing the challenges of intermediaries and cross-border [holdings](../h/holdings.md) while enhancing [security](../s/security.md) and [transparency](../t/transparency.md).

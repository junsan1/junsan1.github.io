# Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM)

The [Home Equity](../h/home_equity.md) Conversion [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md), commonly referred to as HECM, is a type of reverse [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) that is insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). Designed specifically for older homeowners, generally aged 62 and above, a HECM allows them to convert a portion of their [home](../h/home.md)’s [equity](../e/equity.md) into cash without having to sell their [home](../h/home.md), [give up](../g/give_up.md) the title, or take on a new monthly [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [payment](../p/payment.md). This financial product can be an essential tool for seniors looking to improve their financial stability and [quality of life](../q/quality_of_life.md) during retirement.

## Key Features and Qualifications

### Age and Ownership Requirements

To qualify for a HECM, the homeowner must be at least 62 years old. Additionally, the [home](../h/home.md) must be a primary residence, and the borrower must either own the [home](../h/home.md) outright or have a significant amount of [equity](../e/equity.md). Any existing [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) or liens against the property must be paid off using the funds from the HECM.

### Property Eligibility

The [home](../h/home.md) in question must meet specific FHA property standards. Eligible property types typically include single-family homes, two-to-four unit homes with one unit occupied by the borrower, HUD-approved condominiums, and manufactured homes that meet FHA requirements.

### Financial Assessment

Potential borrowers undergo a financial assessment to ensure they can continue to meet the [obligations](../o/obligation.md) of [home](../h/home.md) ownership, such as property [taxes](../t/taxes.md), [homeowners insurance](../h/homeowners_insurance.md), and maintenance.

### Counseling Requirements

Before proceeding with a HECM, homeowners are required to participate in a session with a HUD-approved reverse [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) counselor. This counseling session is designed to ensure the homeowner fully understands the implications and responsibilities of obtaining a reverse [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md).

## Types of Payouts

A HECM provides several [options](../o/options.md) for how borrowers can receive their funds:

1. **Lump Sum**: The borrower receives the entire [loan](../l/loan.md) proceeds at once, which is only available with a fixed-rate HECM.
2. **Tenure Payments**: The borrower receives fixed monthly payments for as long as they live in the [home](../h/home.md).
3. **Term Payments**: The borrower receives fixed monthly payments for a specified number of years.
4. **Line of [Credit](../c/credit.md)**: The borrower can draw amounts as needed until the line of [credit](../c/credit.md) is exhausted, and only pays [interest](../i/interest.md) on the amount actually borrowed.
5. **Modified Tenure/Term**: A combination of a line of [credit](../c/credit.md) with monthly payments for a specified term or tenure.

## Interest Rates

HECMs can have either fixed or adjustable [interest](../i/interest.md) rates. Fixed-rate HECMs typically provide a single lump sum [payment](../p/payment.md), whereas adjustable-rate HECMs [offer](../o/offer.md) more flexibility with the choice of different [payout](../p/payout.md) [options](../o/options.md).

## Costs and Fees

Several costs are associated with obtaining a HECM, including:

- **[Origination](../o/origination.md) Fees**: Fees charged by the [lender](../l/lender.md) for processing the HECM [loan](../l/loan.md).
- **[Mortgage Insurance](../m/mortgage_insurance.md) [Premium](../p/premium.md) (MIP)**: An upfront [fee](../f/fee.md) along with annual premiums to insure the [loan](../l/loan.md), which protects both the borrower and [lender](../l/lender.md).
- **Third-party Charges**: [Appraisal](../a/appraisal.md) fees, [credit report](../c/credit_report.md) fees, [title insurance](../t/title_insurance.md), and other closing costs.
- **Servicing Fees**: Monthly fees for the servicing of the [loan](../l/loan.md) may also be applicable.

## Repayment of the Loan

Unlike a traditional [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md), HECM loans do not require monthly [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) payments. Instead, the balance of the [loan](../l/loan.md) is repaid when the borrower sells the [home](../h/home.md), permanently moves out, or passes away. [Repayment](../r/repayment.md) can also be triggered if the borrower fails to meet the [loan](../l/loan.md) requirements, such as paying property [taxes](../t/taxes.md) or maintaining [homeowners insurance](../h/homeowners_insurance.md).

### Non-Recourse Loan

HECMs are non-[recourse](../r/recourse.md) loans, meaning that the borrower (or their heirs) [will](../w/will.md) not owe more than the [home](../h/home.md)’s [value](../v/value.md) at the time the [loan](../l/loan.md) is repaid. If the [loan](../l/loan.md) balance exceeds the [home](../h/home.md)’s [value](../v/value.md), the FHA [insurance](../i/insurance.md) [will](../w/will.md) cover the difference.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

- **Supplemental [Income](../i/income.md)**: Provides additional [income](../i/income.md) during retirement without the need to sell the [home](../h/home.md).
- **No Monthly Payments**: Borrowers are not required to make monthly [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) payments, easing financial burdens.
- **Non-[Recourse](../r/recourse.md) Protection**: Guarantees that borrowers [will](../w/will.md) never owe more than the [value](../v/value.md) of the [home](../h/home.md).
- **Flexible [Disbursement](../d/disbursement.md) [Options](../o/options.md)**: [Multiple](../m/multiple.md) ways to receive funds tailored to financial needs.

### Disadvantages

- **Costs**: Upfront and ongoing fees can be substantial.
- **[Equity](../e/equity.md) Reduction**: Over time, [home equity](../h/home_equity.md) decreases as [loan](../l/loan.md) balances increase.
- **Risks of [Foreclosure](../f/foreclosure.md)**: Potential [risk](../r/risk.md) if the borrower fails to comply with [loan](../l/loan.md) terms, such as maintaining [taxes](../t/taxes.md) and [insurance](../i/insurance.md).
- **Impact on Inheritance**: Reduces the amount of inheritance that can be left to heirs due to the [depletion](../d/depletion.md) of [home equity](../h/home_equity.md).

## Key Considerations Before Applying

1. **Evaluate Needs**: Determine if a HECM fits with long-term financial goals and needs, considering other [options](../o/options.md) like downsizing or traditional [home equity](../h/home_equity.md) loans.
2. **Understand Costs**: Fully understand the upfront costs, [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, and impact on [home equity](../h/home_equity.md).
3. **Family Discussions**: Communicate with family members about the decision, as it impacts inheritance and the future of the [home](../h/home.md).
4. **Future Plans**: Consider plans for moving or selling the [home](../h/home.md) in the future, as this impacts [loan](../l/loan.md) [repayment](../r/repayment.md).

## Conclusion

The [Home Equity](../h/home_equity.md) Conversion [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) can be a versatile and useful financial tool for older homeowners looking to [leverage](../l/leverage.md) their largest [asset](../a/asset.md)—their [home equity](../h/home_equity.md)—to provide additional [income](../i/income.md) and financial stability in retirement. However, it requires careful consideration, planning, and counseling to ensure it aligns with the homeowner’s financial goals and needs.

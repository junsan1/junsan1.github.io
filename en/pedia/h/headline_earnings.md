# Headline Earnings

### What Are Headline Earnings?

Headline [earnings](../e/earnings.md) refer to a key financial metric in the corporate world, particularly in markets like South Africa. These [earnings](../e/earnings.md) are utilized to present a companyâ€™s [earnings](../e/earnings.md) performance without the distortion of [capital](../c/capital.md), non-operational, and [extraordinary items](../e/extraordinary_item.md). The metric is intended to [offer](../o/offer.md) analysts and investors a clearer view of a company's operational profitability. They exclude certain items that might inflate or deflate [earnings](../e/earnings.md), helping to provide a more accurate picture of a company's ongoing [business activities](../b/business_activities.md).

### Importance of Headline Earnings

#### Transparency and Comparability

- **[Transparency](../t/transparency.md):** By excluding [extraordinary items](../e/extraordinary_item.md), such as profits or losses from the [sale](../s/sale.md) of assets, headline [earnings](../e/earnings.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) a transparent view of operational performance.
  
- **Comparability:** Headline [earnings](../e/earnings.md) facilitate a more apples-to-apples comparison of performance over different periods and across companies. This is because the measure is less likely to be skewed by one-off events.

### Calculation of Headline Earnings

The calculation of headline [earnings](../e/earnings.md) usually begins with the net [income](../i/income.md) figure. Adjustments are then made to this figure by excluding or including various components such as:

#### Exclusions:

- **Gains or Losses on [Asset](../a/asset.md) Sales:** These are typically non-recurring and do not impact ongoing operational performance.
  
- **Impairments:** Write-downs of assets may distort [earnings](../e/earnings.md) and are excluded for a more accurate portrayal of operational profitability.
  
- **[Fair Value](../f/fair_value.md) Adjustments:** These adjustments can introduce significant [volatility](../v/volatility.md) into [earnings](../e/earnings.md) and are often excluded.
  
- **Non-recurring Items:** Any extraordinary, non-recurring expenses or incomes that distort the true [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) of the company.

#### Inclusions:

- **Operational Gains/Losses:** Any [income](../i/income.md) or loss that arises directly from the company's standard operational activities.
  
- **Recurring Financial Items:** [Interest](../i/interest.md) expenses, [taxes](../t/taxes.md), and other recurring items are generally included to provide a full picture of operational health.

An example formula might look like this:
```
Headline [Earnings](../e/earnings.md) = Net [Income](../i/income.md) - (Gains from [Asset](../a/asset.md) Sales + Impairments + [Fair Value](../f/fair_value.md) Adjustments + Non-recurring Items)
```

### Headline Earnings vs. Net Income

One of the most common questions is how headline [earnings](../e/earnings.md) differ from net [income](../i/income.md). Net [income](../i/income.md) is the "[bottom line](../b/bottom_line.md)" of a company's [income statement](../i/income_statement.md) and includes all types of [income](../i/income.md) and expenses. Headline [earnings](../e/earnings.md), on the other hand, aim to remove the [noise](../n/noise.md) from net [income](../i/income.md) to show what company management believes to be a more appropriate measure of operational performance.

### Regulatory and Reporting Standards

In South Africa, headline [earnings](../e/earnings.md) are mandated by the Johannesburg Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (JSE). [Listed](../l/listed.md) companies are required to report this metric in their [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md), and it must conform to the guidelines prescribed by SAICA (South African Institute of Chartered Accountants).

### Headline Earnings per Share (HEPS)

Headline [Earnings](../e/earnings.md) per Share (HEPS) is another important metric, providing a per-share view of headline [earnings](../e/earnings.md). It is particularly valuable for investors as it adjusts [earnings](../e/earnings.md) per share (EPS) for the non-operational items discussed previously.

```
HEPS = Headline [Earnings](../e/earnings.md) / Number of Outstanding [Shares](../s/shares.md)
```

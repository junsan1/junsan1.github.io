# Held Order

## Definition

A held [order](../o/order.md) in trading is an [order](../o/order.md) that must be executed immediately once it is received by a [broker](../b/broker.md). Unlike other types of orders where some discretion is provided to the [broker](../b/broker.md) or [trader](../t/trader.md) regarding the timing or conditions of the [execution](../e/execution.md), held orders require immediate [execution](../e/execution.md) because they typically involve [market](../m/market.md) orders that need to be filled as quickly as possible at the best available price in the [market](../m/market.md).

## Key Characteristics

### Immediate Execution
Held orders are characterized by their requirement for immediate [execution](../e/execution.md). They are often used when the [trader](../t/trader.md) or [investor](../i/investor.md) wants to ensure that their [order](../o/order.md) gets filled quickly, usually during periods of high [market](../m/market.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) to avoid any significant price movements.

### Market Orders
Held orders are usually [market](../m/market.md) orders, meaning they are to be executed at the best available price in the [market](../m/market.md). As opposed to limit orders, where the [trader](../t/trader.md) specifies a price at which they are willing to buy or sell, a held [order](../o/order.md) does not specify any such price limitations.

### No Discretion
Brokers do not have any discretion with a held [order](../o/order.md). They cannot [hold](../h/hold.md) off on executing the [order](../o/order.md) waiting for a better price or more favorable [market](../m/market.md) conditions. The primary goal is to ensure that the [order](../o/order.md) is executed immediately upon receipt.

## Use Cases

### High Urgency
Traders may use held orders in situations where it is imperative that their [trade](../t/trade.md) is executed immediately. This can be the case during volatile [market](../m/market.md) conditions or when specific [market](../m/market.md)-moving news is expected. This ensures that the [order](../o/order.md) gets filled before any substantial price move can occur.

### Market Liquidity
Held orders are advantageous during periods of high [market](../m/market.md) [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) when it is likely that the [market](../m/market.md) can absorb the [order](../o/order.md) without significant price impact. For large institutional trades, however, the immediate [execution](../e/execution.md) of a large held [order](../o/order.md) might move the [market](../m/market.md) unfavorably.

### Reducing Slippage
For retail traders, held orders can reduce the [risk](../r/risk.md) of [slippage](../s/slippage.md), which is the difference between the expected price of a [trade](../t/trade.md) and the actual price at which the [trade](../t/trade.md) is executed. By placing a held [order](../o/order.md), traders aim to get their orders filled at the current [market price](../m/market_price.md), minimizing the potential for [slippage](../s/slippage.md).

## Examples in Practice

### Retail Trading
An individual [investor](../i/investor.md) who is watching the markets sees a favorable price point for a stock and wants to ensure that they can buy or sell that stock immediately at the current [market price](../m/market_price.md). They would use a held [order](../o/order.md) to ensure this immediate [execution](../e/execution.md).

### Institutional Trading
An institutional [trader](../t/trader.md) managing a large portfolio might use held orders to quickly adjust their portfolio in response to unexpected news or economic data releases, ensuring that their orders are executed at prevailing [market](../m/market.md) prices without delay.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

1. **Speed of [Execution](../e/execution.md):** The primary advantage of a held [order](../o/order.md) is its speed. The [trade](../t/trade.md) is executed immediately, which is crucial in fast-moving markets.
2. **Simplicity:** Held orders involve less complexity compared to other types of orders that might require careful consideration of [market](../m/market.md) conditions and price levels.
3. **Certainty:** There is greater certainty that the [order](../o/order.md) [will](../w/will.md) be executed, as it does not rely on meeting specific price conditions.

### Disadvantages

1. **Potential for Poor Pricing:** Because held orders must be executed immediately, they might be filled at less favorable prices, especially in volatile or low-[liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) markets.
2. **Lack of Flexibility:** Held orders provide no flexibility for the [broker](../b/broker.md) to achieve better pricing through discretion or [market timing](../m/market_timing.md).
3. **[Market](../m/market.md) Impact:** Large held orders can move the [market](../m/market.md) against the [trader](../t/trader.md)'s favor if not properly managed, particularly in less [liquid](../l/liquid.md) markets.

## Regulatory Considerations

Financial regulatory bodies often have guidelines and rules governing the [execution](../e/execution.md) of held orders to ensure that brokers and trading platforms adhere to principles of best [execution](../e/execution.md) and [market](../m/market.md) integrity.

## Algo Trading Context

### Algorithmic Execution Strategies
In the realm of [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), held orders can be integrated into certain [execution algorithms](../e/execution_algorithms.md) that prioritize immediate [execution](../e/execution.md) over other factors. These algorithms [will](../w/will.md) typically route the held orders to the most [liquid](../l/liquid.md) venues to ensure swift [execution](../e/execution.md).

### Impact on Market Microstructure
In [market microstructure](../m/market_microstructure.md), the use of held orders by various [market](../m/market.md) participants can affect the dynamics of [order](../o/order.md) flow and price formation. High-frequency traders and [market](../m/market.md) makers must account for the presence of these orders and potentially adjust their strategies to accommodate the higher degree of immediacy attached to held orders.

## Conclusion

A held [order](../o/order.md) represents an essential tool for traders who require the certainty of immediate [execution](../e/execution.md). While it carries certain risks, such as unfavorable pricing and [market](../m/market.md) impact, it remains a popular choice for both retail and institutional traders seeking to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on time-sensitive opportunities or to manage [risk](../r/risk.md) in volatile markets. The regulatory framework surrounding held orders ensures [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and fairness in their [execution](../e/execution.md), reinforcing their role in modern [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

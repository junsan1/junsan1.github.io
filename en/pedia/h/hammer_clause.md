# Hammer Clause

When delving into the world of professional [liability insurance](../l/liability_insurance.md), especially during litigations and settlements, one often encounters various clauses that can significantly influence the financial impact and decision-making for the insured. One critical clause among these is the "Hammer Clause". This guideline provides an in-depth understanding of what a Hammer Clause is, how it operates, and explores real-world examples to demonstrate its practical implications.

## What is a Hammer Clause?

A Hammer Clause is a [provision](../p/provision.md) in professional [liability insurance](../l/liability_insurance.md) policies that limits the insurer's obligation when the insured decides not to consent to a settlement recommended by the insurer. Essentially, it shifts the [financial risk](../f/financial_risk.md) of trial outcomes to the insured under certain conditions. This clause is named metaphorically to denote the "[hammering](../h/hammering.md)" effect it can have on the insured if they refuse a settlement [offer](../o/offer.md) and opt to proceed with litigation.

### Purpose and Significance

The main intent of a Hammer Clause is twofold:
1. **Control Costs:** By encouraging settlements, insurers can control or mitigate the costs associated with prolonged litigation.
2. **Manage Risks:** It manages and distributes the [risk](../r/risk.md) between the insurer and the insured, often serving as [leverage](../l/leverage.md) for the insurer to avoid costly lawsuits.

## How Does a Hammer Clause Work?

The mechanics of a Hammer Clause revolve around the insurer's recommendation for settlement and the insured’s subsequent actions.

1. **Settlement Recommendation:** The insurer assesses a claim and proposes a settlement amount.
2. **Insured’s Consent:** The insured must agree or disagree with the proposed settlement.
3. **Hammer Clause Activation:** If the insured refuses the settlement, the Hammer Clause activates:
    - The insurer’s [liability](../l/liability.md) may be limited to the amount of the proposed settlement plus defense costs incurred up until the refusal.
    - Any additional costs, judgments, or settlements that exceed this amount might be the responsibility of the insured.

### Types of Hammer Clauses

There are several variations of the Hammer Clause, and each lays out different repercussions for refusing a recommended settlement:

1. **Traditional (Hard) Hammer Clause:** Limits the insurer's [liability](../l/liability.md) strictly to the amount of the proposed settlement. All additional expenses fall entirely on the insured.
2. **Modified (Soft) Hammer Clause:** [Shares](../s/shares.md) the additional expenses between the insurer and insured, often on a proportional [basis](../b/basis.md) (e.g., 50/50 split).
3. **Percentage Hammer Clause:** The insurer continues to cover a certain percentage of the defense costs beyond the proposed settlement, but the insured shoulders the remaining costs.

### Real-World Example of a Hammer Clause

Consider a case where a consulting [firm](../f/firm.md) faces a professional [liability](../l/liability.md) claim amounting to potential damages of $1 million. The insurer evaluates the claim and recommends settling for $300,000 to avoid the risks and expenses associated with a trial. Here’s how the scenarios might unfold based on the Hammer Clause in place:

1. **Scenario with Hard Hammer Clause:**
    - Insured refuses the settlement.
    - Case goes to trial and the final [judgment](../j/judgment.md) amounts to $900,000 with $100,000 in defense costs.
    - The insurer pays only the proposed $300,000 for settlement and $100,000 for defense costs (totaling $400,000).
    - The insured is responsible for the remaining $600,000.

2. **Scenario with Soft Hammer Clause (50/50 split):**
    - Insured refuses the settlement.
    - Case goes to trial with the same costs as mentioned above.
    - The insurer and the insured share the additional $600,000 costs equally, with each paying $300,000.
    - The insurer pays $600,000 ($300,000 proposed settlement + $50,000 defense costs + $300,000 half of additional costs).
    - The insured also pays $300,000.

3. **Scenario with Percentage Hammer Clause (70/30 split):**
    - Insured refuses the settlement.
    - With a 70/30 clause, the insurer covers 70% of any additional costs.
    - Insurer pays $810,000 (proposed settlement amount $300,000 + defense costs $100,000 + 70% of the additional $600,000 which is $420,000).
    - Insured pays $190,000 (30% of additional costs).

## Implications and Considerations

The existence of a Hammer Clause in a [liability](../l/liability.md) policy bears significant implications for both the insured party and their decision-making process. Some key considerations include:

1. **Informed Decision-Making:** 

    Insured individuals or entities must carefully evaluate the proposed settlements and potential outcomes of litigations, weighing the benefits of settling early against the risks and costs of a protracted legal battle.

2. **Legal and Financial Advisors:**

    It is often prudent for the insured to consult with legal and financial advisors to understand the full [scope](../s/scope.md) of the Hammer Clause and to strategize appropriately.

3. **Policy Negotiations:** 

    During the [negotiation](../n/negotiation.md) phase of [insurance](../i/insurance.md) policy terms, insured parties should be aware of the different types of Hammer Clauses and negotiate terms that [offer](../o/offer.md) fair [risk](../r/risk.md) [distribution](../d/distribution.md).

4. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md):**

    Companies might have to develop [robust](../r/robust.md) [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) and dispute resolution strategies to minimize instances where a Hammer Clause could be disadvantageous.

5. **[Industry](../i/industry.md) Practices:** 

    [Industry](../i/industry.md) norms and practices might influence the utilization and fairness of Hammer Clauses, and insured parties should be mindful of such trends.

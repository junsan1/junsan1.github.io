# Heavy Industry

Heavy [industry](../i/industry.md) refers to industries that involve large-scale production and are characterized by the high [capital](../c/capital.md) intensity, significant environmental impact, and advanced technology. These industries often produce goods and materials used as inputs for other industries, including the [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) of large machinery, steel production, shipbuilding, [mining](../m/mining.md), chemical industries, and more. They tend to have higher physical and economic impacts compared to light industries, which generally focus on [consumer goods](../c/consumer_goods.md) that require less [capital](../c/capital.md) and [raw materials](../r/raw_materials.md).

## Key Characteristics of Heavy Industry

1. **[Capital](../c/capital.md)-Intensive**: Heavy [industry](../i/industry.md) typically requires significant investment in machinery, equipment, and [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md). The [capital](../c/capital.md) intensity is due to the large-scale production processes and advanced technology needed to manufacture products.

2. **High Environmental Impact**: Processes involved in heavy industries often have significant environmental implications. For example, steel production can result in considerable emissions, and [mining](../m/mining.md) can lead to deforestation and soil erosion.

3. **Advanced Technology**: Heavy industries often rely on cutting-edge technology to improve [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md), safety, and production quality. This includes the use of automation, robotics, and advanced software for process management.

4. **Large-Scale Production**: These industries often operate on a vast scale, producing substantial quantities of [raw materials](../r/raw_materials.md) and goods. The [economies of scale](../e/economies_of_scale.md) benefit them by lowering per-unit costs when production is increased.

5. **Raw Material Dependency**: Heavy industries are heavily reliant on [raw materials](../r/raw_materials.md) such as iron ore, coal, oil, and gas to fuel their production processes.

6. **Skilled Workforce**: Due to the complexity of operations, heavy industries usually require a skilled and trained workforce for operation and maintenance of advanced machinery and technologies.

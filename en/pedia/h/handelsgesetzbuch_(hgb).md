# Handelsgesetzbuch (HGB)

The Handelsgesetzbuch (HGB), also known as the German Commercial Code, is a comprehensive body of law that governs commercial transactions in Germany. Established in 1897, the HGB provides the legal framework for [business activities](../b/business_activities.md), including [trade](../t/trade.md), commercial transactions, and the legal standing of merchants in Germany. Understanding the HGB is crucial for anyone involved in [business](../b/business.md) within the country as it delineates the rights and [obligations](../o/obligation.md) of companies and traders.

## Overview of the HGB

The HGB is divided into five books:
1. **Book 1: [General Provisions](../g/general_provisions.md)**
2. **Book 2: Commercial Companies**
3. **Book 3: Commercial Books**
4. **Book 4: Trading Transactions**
5. **Book 5: Maritime [Trade](../t/trade.md)**

Each book addresses different aspects of commercial law and is essential for understanding the broader legal environment of [business](../b/business.md) operations in Germany.

### Book 1: General Provisions

Book 1 of the HGB lays down the [general provisions](../g/general_provisions.md) that apply to traders and commercial transactions. It defines what constitutes a merchant (Kaufmann) and outlines the key principles of commercial law. Key elements include:

- **Definition of a Merchant (Kaufmann)**: According to §1 HGB, a merchant is anyone who operates a [business](../b/business.md) (Gewerbe) unless the nature or [scope](../s/scope.md) of the [business](../b/business.md) does not require a commercially organized [business](../b/business.md) operation.
  
- **Company Name (Firma)**: The provisions include rules on the selection and usage of company names to ensure clarity and prevent misleading the public (§17–37 HGB).

- **Registered Offices**: This part of the HGB requires businesses to have a registered office and mandates the maintenance of an updated commercial register (§29 HGB).

### Book 2: Commercial Companies

Book 2 addresses the different types of commercial partnerships and corporations recognized in German law, such as the [general partnership](../g/general_partnership.md) (OHG), limited partnership (KG), and the silent partnership. Key points include:

- **[General Partnership](../g/general_partnership.md) (OHG)**: An OHG is a partnership in which all partners are jointly liable for the partnership's [obligations](../o/obligation.md) (§105–160 HGB).

- **Limited Partnership (KG)**: A KG differs from an OHG in that it includes general partners with [unlimited liability](../u/unlimited_liability.md) and limited partners whose [liability](../l/liability.md) is restricted to their financial contributions (§161–177 HGB).

- **Silent Partnership**: This is a contractual arrangement where a [silent partner](../s/silent_partner.md) contributes [capital](../c/capital.md) to a [business](../b/business.md) but does not participate in its management (§230–239 HGB).

### Book 3: Commercial Books

Book 3 outlines the requirements for bookkeeping and the preparation of commercial [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md). It is essential for ensuring [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and accountability in [business](../b/business.md) operations. Main aspects:

- **[Accounting](../a/accounting.md) Requirements**: Merchants must maintain books that reflect their financial position (§238 HGB).

- **Balance Sheets and [Profit](../p/profit.md) and Loss Accounts**: Businesses are required to prepare annual [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) including a [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) and [profit](../p/profit.md) and loss account (§242–256 HGB).

- **Publication Requirements**: Certain types of businesses must publish their annual [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) to inform stakeholders about their [financial health](../f/financial_health.md) (§325 HGB).

### Book 4: Trading Transactions

This book details the rules governing trading and commercial transactions, covering both domestic and international [commerce](../c/commerce.md). Key areas include:

- **Commercial Purchase Agreements**: Special rules apply to commercial purchase agreements, including delivery [obligations](../o/obligation.md) and the examination of goods (§373–381 HGB).

- **[Commission](../c/commission.md) Agent Activities**: The HGB regulates the activities of [commission](../c/commission.md) agents who act on behalf of another party to purchase or sell goods (§383–406 HGB).

- **Transport and Freight**: This section addresses the rights and [obligations](../o/obligation.md) of carriers and consignors in the transportation of goods (§407–475 HGB).

### Book 5: Maritime Trade

The final book focuses on maritime [trade](../t/trade.md), crucial for Germany's position as one of the world's leading exporters. Important topics include:

- **Ship Ownership and Registry**: Details concerning the ownership, registration, and flagging of ships (§476–490 HGB).

- **Maritime Liabilities**: Regulation of the liabilities of ship owners, including crew and passenger [obligations](../o/obligation.md) (§501–504 HGB).

- **Maritime [Insurance](../i/insurance.md)**: The particularities of insuring maritime ventures, addressing both hull [insurance](../i/insurance.md) and [liability insurance](../l/liability_insurance.md) (§778–805 HGB).

## Practical Implications

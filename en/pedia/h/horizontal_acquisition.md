# Horizontal Acquisition

Horizontal [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md), often referred to as a [horizontal merger](../h/horizontal_merger.md), is a type of [business](../b/business.md) strategy where one company acquires another company operating within the same [industry](../i/industry.md) and typically at the same stage of the production process. This strategy aims to increase [market share](../m/market_share.md), reduce competition, achieve [economies of scale](../e/economies_of_scale.md), and expand product or service offerings.

## Motivation Behind Horizontal Acquisitions

1. **[Market Share](../m/market_share.md) [Expansion](../e/expansion.md)**: One of the primary drivers behind horizontal acquisitions is the desire to increase [market share](../m/market_share.md). By combining forces with a competitor, companies can quickly increase their [customer](../c/customer.md) base.

2. **[Economies of Scale](../e/economies_of_scale.md)**: Companies can achieve significant cost savings through [economies of scale](../e/economies_of_scale.md). By integrating operations, companies often reduce per-unit costs by spreading fixed costs across a larger [volume](../v/volume.md) of products.

3. **Reduction of Competition**: Acquiring competitors effectively reduces the number of players in the [market](../m/market.md), often allowing the acquiring company to possess greater pricing power.

4. **[Expansion](../e/expansion.md) of Product Lines**: Horizontal acquisitions allow companies to diversify their product or service offerings. This can be particularly advantageous in meeting more of their customers' needs.

5. **Synergies**: The combination of two companies often leads to synergies, where the performance and [value](../v/value.md) of the combined entity exceed the sum of the separate entities.

## Examples of Horizontal Acquisitions

1. **Facebook and Instagram**: In 2012, Facebook acquired Instagram for approximately $1 billion. Both companies operated in the [social media](../s/social_media.md) space, allowing Facebook to expand its user base and enhance its photo-sharing capabilities.
   
2. **Disney and 21st Century Fox**: Disney's [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) of 21st Century Fox in 2019 for $71.3 billion exemplifies a notable horizontal [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) in the entertainment [industry](../i/industry.md). The [merger](../m/merger.md) brought together two of the largest studios, combining their media assets and intellectual properties.

3. **Volkswagen and Porsche**: Volkswagen's [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) of Porsche in 2012 allowed the former to expand its luxury car offerings and [leverage](../l/leverage.md) Porsche’s brand strength and advanced engineering.

## Legal and Regulatory Considerations

Horizontal acquisitions are often subject to stringent scrutiny from regulatory bodies such as the Federal [Trade](../t/trade.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (FTC) in the United States or the European [Commission](../c/commission.md) in the [European Union](../e/european_union_(eu).md). The primary concern for regulators is the potential for reduced competition and the adverse effects on consumers, such as higher prices, reduced innovation, and lower quality of products and services.

[Antitrust](../a/antitrust.md) policies are established to prevent [monopoly](../m/monopoly.md) formation and to protect consumer interests. Companies looking to complete a horizontal [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) must often prove that the benefits, such as reduced costs or improved services, outweigh any potential negative impacts on [market](../m/market.md) competition.

## Challenges in Horizontal Acquisitions

1. **Cultural Integration**: Merging two organizations with distinct corporate cultures can be a daunting task. Cultural clashes can lead to employee dissatisfaction and [turnover](../t/turnover.md), negatively affecting [productivity](../p/productivity.md).

2. **Redundancies**: While cost savings are a significant advantage, redundancies in staffing and roles can lead to layoffs and other forms of downsizing. This can affect employee morale and lead to public relations challenges.

3. **Regulatory Hurdles**: Navigating the myriad of regulatory requirements can be time-consuming and costly. Companies must be prepared for potential delays and modifications to the terms of the [merger](../m/merger.md).

4. **Integration of Systems and Processes**: Combining different IT systems, [supply](../s/supply.md) chains, and operational processes can be complex and challenging. In some cases, expected synergies may take longer to realize than initially anticipated.

## Benefits of Horizontal Acquisitions

1. **Increased [Market Power](../m/market_power.md)**: The combined entity's enhanced [market power](../m/market_power.md) can lead to stronger [negotiation](../n/negotiation.md) positions with suppliers and customers.

2. **Access to New Markets**: Acquisitions can [open](../o/open.md) up new geographic markets or [customer](../c/customer.md) segments that were previously inaccessible, facilitating growth.

3. **[Risk](../r/risk.md) [Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: By diversifying product lines and services, companies can reduce their reliance on a single line of [business](../b/business.md), thereby mitigating risks.

4. **Enhanced Competitive Edge**: Companies can [gain](../g/gain.md) access to new technologies, patents, and innovative practices through the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md), better positioning themselves against competitors.

## Case Studies of Successful Horizontal Acquisitions

1. **Exxon and Mobil**: The [merger](../m/merger.md) between Exxon and Mobil in 1999 led to the creation of ExxonMobil, one of the largest oil and gas companies in the world. This [merger](../m/merger.md) enabled significant cost savings through [economies of scale](../e/economies_of_scale.md) and combined resources.

2. **Sirius and XM Radio**: In 2008, Sirius Satellite Radio merged with XM Satellite Radio to create SiriusXM. This [merger](../m/merger.md) brought together two leading satellite radio providers, enhancing their service offerings and [customer](../c/customer.md) base.

3. **Dell and EMC**: Dell’s [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) of EMC in 2016 for $67 billion created one of the largest technology mergers. The combined entity leveraged EMC’s storage solutions with Dell’s [market](../m/market.md) presence in personal computers and servers.

## Failed Horizontal Acquisitions

1. **AT&T and T-Mobile**: In 2011, AT&T attempted to acquire T-Mobile for $39 billion, but the deal faced opposition from the Department of Justice and the Federal Communications [Commission](../c/commission.md) due to [antitrust](../a/antitrust.md) concerns. The [merger](../m/merger.md) was not completed, and AT&T had to pay a $4 billion breakup [fee](../f/fee.md) to T-Mobile.

2. **Comcast and Time Warner Cable**: Comcast’s proposed [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) of Time Warner Cable in 2014 faced significant regulatory hurdles. Concerns over reduced competition in the cable and broadband markets led to the deal being abandoned in 2015.

## Conclusion

Horizontal acquisitions are a powerful strategic tool for companies seeking growth, [market](../m/market.md) dominance, and efficiencies. However, they come with inherent challenges and complexities that require careful planning and [execution](../e/execution.md). Understanding the motivations, benefits, and potential pitfalls associated with horizontal acquisitions is essential for businesses aiming to successfully navigate these transactions.

# Hyperledger

Hyperledger is an [open](../o/open.md)-source collaborative effort created to advance cross-[industry](../i/industry.md) [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technologies. It is hosted by The Linux Foundation and includes leaders in [finance](../f/finance.md), banking, Internet of Things, [supply](../s/supply.md) chains, [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md), and technology. The platform is designed to support the management and [optimization](../o/optimization.md) of [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md), making it easier for organizations to create and deploy [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) applications. Hyperledger's modular architecture allows developers to utilize only those blocks they need, optimizing their [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) for their specific use cases.

## Objectives of Hyperledger

1. **[Blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) For [Business](../b/business.md)**: Hyperledger is focused on creating [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) frameworks and platforms aimed specifically at [business](../b/business.md) use. It ensures that the solutions are capable of handling the performance and confidentiality essential for [business](../b/business.md) transactions.
   
2. **Modular Architecture**: One of the primary goals is to create a modular architecture, making it easy for organizations to mix and match components to overcome specific [business](../b/business.md) needs. This modularity translates to flexibility, enabling implementers to tailor [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) networks.
   
3. **Collaborative Development**: Hyperledger encourages collaborative development. This ecosystem approach ensures rapid innovation and shared solutions for common problems.

## Key Components

### Hyperledger Fabric

[Hyperledger Fabric](../h/hyperledger_fabric.md) is an enterprise-grade, distributed ledger platform that uses [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md) to support data privacy and confidentiality requirements. Fabric is designed for use cases across a variety of industries.

#### Key Features

- **Modularity**: [Hyperledger Fabric](../h/hyperledger_fabric.md) is fully modular. Components such as consensus and membership services are plug-and-play.
- **Permissioned**: Access to the ledger can be restricted to approved members, enhancing [security](../s/security.md).
- **Multi-Language [Smart Contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md)**: It supports Chaincode ([smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md)) written in Go, JavaScript, and Java.

### Hyperledger Sawtooth

[Hyperledger Sawtooth](../h/hyperledger_sawtooth.md) provides a highly modular platform for building, deploying, and running [distributed ledgers](../d/distributed_ledgers.md). It aims to keep ledgers distributed and maintain Smart Contract and [transaction](../t/transaction.md) logic free from the core system, making it suitable for large enterprises.

#### Key Features

- **Parallel [Transaction Execution](../t/transaction_execution.md)**: Enhances [throughput](../t/throughput.md) and [scalability](../s/scalability.md).
- **Dynamic Consensus**: Consensus can be adjusted without stopping the network or rewriting code.
- **Flexible Permissioning**: Allows for public and permissioned [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) applications.

### Hyperledger Iroha

[Hyperledger Iroha](../h/hyperledger_iroha.md) is a [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) framework tailored for simple and straightforward use case integrations. It is particularly focused on mobile development.

#### Key Features

- **Easy Integration**: Iroha is designed to be easy to integrate into various projects, featuring simple APIs and a permissive Apache 2.0 licensing.
- **Rich Set of Functions**: Includes a wide set of pre-built commands and queries for managing assets, information, and permissions.

### Hyperledger Indy

Hyperledger Indy is a distributed ledger system designed for decentralized identity management. It provides tools and libraries essential for decentralized identity ecosystems.

#### Key Features

- **Self-Sovereign Identity**: Focuses on enabling independent digital identities that are operated and controlled by the entities who own them.
- **Verifiable Credentials**: Supports issuing, storing, and verifying credentials in a trustworthy manner.

### Hyperledger Besu

Hyperledger Besu is an [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) client designed for enterprise use. It can be used for both public and private networks.

#### Key Features

- **Enterprise Integration**: It includes features that support enterprise use cases like monitoring, permissioning, and enhanced privacy.
- **Standards-Based**: Built to comply with the existing [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) specifications, ensuring compatibility.

## Governance and Community

### The Linux Foundation

Hyperledger is governed by The Linux Foundation, which administers a variety of collaborative projects. The foundation plays a pivotal role in the governance of the project by maintaining [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md), legal support, and empowering collaboration among project contributors.

### Technical Steering Committee (TSC)

The TSC governs and maintains the strategic direction and administrative matters of Hyperledger projects. It sets technical guidelines and ensures the coherence and coordination between various sub-projects.

### Collaboration with Industry

Hyperledger actively collaborates with [industry](../i/industry.md) leaders. Its network ranges across [finance](../f/finance.md), banking, IoT, [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md), and technology, ensuring that the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) solutions meet real-world, industrial needs.

## Use Cases

### Supply Chain Management

**IBM Food [Trust](../t/trust.md)**: IBM Food [Trust](../t/trust.md) leverages [Hyperledger Fabric](../h/hyperledger_fabric.md) to create a more transparent and efficient [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md). It tracks every step of the [supply](../s/supply.md) process, from farm to table, ensuring better [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and food safety.

### Healthcare

**Change Healthcare**: This healthcare technology company uses [Hyperledger Fabric](../h/hyperledger_fabric.md) to improve the [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and auditability of healthcare transactions, aiming to reduce administration costs and enhance patient care.

### Finance

**We.[Trade](../t/trade.md)**: Leveraging [Hyperledger Fabric](../h/hyperledger_fabric.md), We.[Trade](../t/trade.md) facilitates [open](../o/open.md)-account [trade](../t/trade.md) for both small and medium-sized enterprises, providing a more secure and efficient [trade finance](../t/trade_finance.md) system.

### Digital Identity

**Sovrin**: Built using Hyperledger Indy, Sovrin is a decentralized identity network intended to give individuals greater control over their digital identities and reduce reliance on centralized authorities.

## Conclusion

Hyperledger provides a versatile, modular suite of frameworks, tools, and libraries that empower industries with secure, interoperable [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) solutions. Its focus on enterprise needs, combined with a strong collaborative community, makes it an outstanding platform for developing [robust](../r/robust.md) and scalable [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) applications.

# Henry Hub

The Henry Hub is a [distribution](../d/distribution.md) hub on the natural gas pipeline system in Erath, Louisiana, which serves as the official delivery location for New York Mercantile [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (NYMEX) natural gas [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md). This central point allows for the physical transfer and [exchange](../e/exchange.md) of natural gas between various [market](../m/market.md) participants. The hub is named after the nearby town of Henry, Louisiana, and its strategic location and extensive connectivity make it a crucial hub for the U.S. natural gas [market](../m/market.md).

## Historical Overview

Henry Hub was selected as the delivery point for NYMEX natural gas [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) in 1990 when natural gas prices were deregulated. Its establishment as a major hub was crucial for the transformation of natural gas markets. By providing a standardized delivery point, Henry Hub facilitated greater [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) in trading and pricing natural gas which has influenced not only domestic markets but also global natural gas markets.

## Infrastructure and Connectivity

The Henry Hub is connected to [multiple](../m/multiple.md) major interstate and intrastate pipelines including:

- **Acadian Pipeline System:** Serving the Gulf Coast region with access to various markets.
- **ANR Pipeline:** Running from Texas to the Midwest, providing a route for gas to flow toward key markets.
- **Columbia Gulf Transmission:** A critical link that extends from the Gulf of Mexico to the Northeastern United States.
- **Equitrans:** Connecting to numerous local [distribution](../d/distribution.md) companies and other interconnections.
- **Gulf South Pipeline:** Providing access up through the Southern United States.
- **Sea Robin Pipeline:** Extending [offshore](../o/offshore.md) to cover the Gulf region.

This extensive network of pipelines enables significant quantities of natural gas to move freely to and from Henry Hub, enhancing its role as a fundamental node in the [market](../m/market.md).

## Market Significance

### Price Benchmark

One of the most critical roles of Henry Hub is its function as the primary pricing point for North American natural gas. The price of natural gas delivered at Henry Hub is often used as a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for the broader natural gas [market](../m/market.md). NYMEX natural gas [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md), which are settled at Henry Hub, are among the most widely traded and watched financial instruments in the [energy sector](../e/energy_sector.md).

### Liquidity and Trading

Henry Hub's status as a central trading point ensures high [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md). This [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) is essential for allowing large volumes of natural gas to be bought and sold without significantly affecting the [market price](../m/market_price.md). This [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) is driven by the hubâ€™s [robust](../r/robust.md) [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) and its central role in [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md).

### Influence on Other Markets

The pricing at Henry Hub does not only affect the U.S. [market](../m/market.md) but also has implications for international markets. LNG (liquefied natural gas) [export](../e/export.md) contracts often reference Henry Hub prices. As the U.S. has ramped up its LNG exports, the global reach of Henry Hub pricing has grown, influencing markets globally.

## Trading Henry Hub Natural Gas

### Futures Contracts

Henry Hub natural gas [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) are traded on the NYMEX platform under the [ticker symbol](../t/ticker_symbol.md) NG. These contracts specify the delivery of natural gas to the Henry Hub, providing traders with a standardized product to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) their positions or speculate on future price movements. Each contract represents 10,000 million British thermal units (MMBtu). Traders use these [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against fluctuations in natural gas prices or for speculative purposes.

### Spot Market

In addition to [futures](../f/futures.md) trading, there is also a [robust](../r/robust.md) [spot market](../s/spot_market.md) for natural gas at Henry Hub. The [spot market](../s/spot_market.md) involves the buying and selling of physical natural gas for immediate or near-term delivery. Prices in the [spot market](../s/spot_market.md) can be more volatile than [futures](../f/futures.md) prices, reacting to immediate [supply](../s/supply.md) and [demand](../d/demand.md) conditions.

### Options and Derivatives

Henry Hub also underpins a variety of other financial instruments including [options](../o/options.md) and over-the-counter (OTC) [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md). [Options](../o/options.md) on natural gas [futures](../f/futures.md) give traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) at a specified price before a certain date. These instruments provide additional flexibility and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) opportunities for [market](../m/market.md) participants.

## Factors Influencing Henry Hub Prices

### Supply and Demand

The most fundamental factors influencing Henry Hub prices are the [supply](../s/supply.md) and [demand](../d/demand.md) dynamics of natural gas. [Supply](../s/supply.md) factors include domestic production levels, [import](../i/import.md) volumes, and storage inventories. [Demand](../d/demand.md) factors encompass seasonal heating and cooling needs, industrial consumption, and electricity generation.

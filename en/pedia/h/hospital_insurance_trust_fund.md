# Hospital Insurance Trust Fund

The Hospital [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) (HI) [Trust Fund](../t/trust_fund.md), also known as Medicare Part A, is one of the two [trust](../t/trust.md) funds established by the U.S. federal government to [finance](../f/finance.md) the Medicare program, which provides [health insurance](../h/health_insurance.md) primarily to individuals aged 65 and older, as well as to some younger people with certain disabilities or conditions. The Medicare program consists of four parts: Part A (Hospital [Insurance](../i/insurance.md)), Part B (Medical [Insurance](../i/insurance.md)), Part C (Medicare Advantage), and Part D (Prescription Drug Coverage). The HI [Trust Fund](../t/trust_fund.md) specifically finances the hospital [insurance](../i/insurance.md) benefits under Medicare Part A.

## Overview of the Medicare Program

### Medicare Part A: Hospital Insurance
Medicare Part A primarily covers inpatient hospital care, skilled nursing [facility](../f/facility.md) care, hospice care, and some [home](../h/home.md) health services. The funding for these services comes directly from the HI [Trust Fund](../t/trust_fund.md). Eligible beneficiaries generally do not pay premiums for Part A, as individuals who have paid Medicare [payroll](../p/payroll.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md) for at least 10 years (40 quarters) qualify for [premium](../p/premium.md)-free Part A coverage. Those who do not meet this requirement can still purchase Part A coverage by paying a monthly [premium](../p/premium.md).

### Medicare Part B: Medical Insurance
Medicare Part B covers physician services, outpatient hospital services, certain [home](../h/home.md) health services, durable medical equipment, and other medical services and supplies not covered by Part A. Part B is funded by premiums paid by beneficiaries and general [revenue](../r/revenue.md) from the federal government.

### Medicare Part C: Medicare Advantage
Medicare Advantage plans are offered by private [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies approved by Medicare. These plans must provide at least the same level of coverage as Original Medicare (Parts A and B) but may include additional benefits such as vision, hearing, dental, and/or health and wellness programs. Medicare Advantage plans are funded by a combination of Medicare payments and premiums paid by beneficiaries.

### Medicare Part D: Prescription Drug Coverage
Medicare Part D provides coverage for prescription drugs through private plans approved by Medicare. Like Medicare Advantage plans, Part D plans receive funding from Medicare and premiums paid by beneficiaries.

## Structure and Management of the HI Trust Fund

The HI [Trust Fund](../t/trust_fund.md) is managed by the Department of the Treasury, specifically the Office of the Secretary of the Treasury, which acts as the managing [trustee](../t/trustee.md). The HI [Trust Fund](../t/trust_fund.md) is overseen by the [Board of Trustees](../b/board_of_trustees.md), which includes the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Labor, and the Commissioner of [Social Security](../s/social_security.md). Each year, the [Board of Trustees](../b/board_of_trustees.md) issues a report to Congress on the financial status of the HI [Trust Fund](../t/trust_fund.md).

### Sources of Revenue for the HI Trust Fund

The HI [Trust Fund](../t/trust_fund.md) has several primary sources of [revenue](../r/revenue.md):

1. **[Payroll](../p/payroll.md) [Taxes](../t/taxes.md)**: The main source of [revenue](../r/revenue.md) for the HI [Trust Fund](../t/trust_fund.md) comes from [payroll](../p/payroll.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md). Employees and employers each contribute 1.45% of wages, and self-employed individuals contribute 2.9% of their net [earnings](../e/earnings.md). 
2. **[Income](../i/income.md) from [Taxation](../t/taxation.md) of [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) Benefits**: A portion of the [revenue](../r/revenue.md) comes from the [taxation](../t/taxation.md) of [Social Security](../s/social_security.md) benefits for higher-[income](../i/income.md) beneficiaries.
3. **[Interest](../i/interest.md) [Earnings](../e/earnings.md)**: The HI [Trust Fund](../t/trust_fund.md) earns [interest](../i/interest.md) on the government securities in which it is invested.
4. **Premiums**: Premiums paid by those who do not qualify for [premium](../p/premium.md)-free Part A coverage also contribute to the [fund](../f/fund.md).

### Expenditures of the HI Trust Fund

The HI [Trust Fund](../t/trust_fund.md)'s expenditures are associated with paying for the covered services under Medicare Part A. These expenditures primarily include payments to:

1. **Inpatient Hospital Services**: Medicare Part A covers a [range](../r/range.md) of inpatient hospital services for beneficiaries, including hospital stays, semi-private rooms, meals, and necessary medical services.
2. **Skilled Nursing [Facility](../f/facility.md) Care**: Medicare Part A covers skilled nursing [facility](../f/facility.md) care, often following a hospital stay, under specific conditions.
3. **Hospice Care**: Medicare Part A covers hospice care for beneficiaries with a terminal illness, focusing on comfort and [quality of life](../q/quality_of_life.md).
4. **[Home](../h/home.md) Health Services**: Medicare Part A covers some [home](../h/home.md) health services for beneficiaries who meet certain conditions.

### Financial Status and Solvency Concerns

The financial status of the HI [Trust Fund](../t/trust_fund.md) is a subject of considerable importance and scrutiny, particularly given the aging population and rising healthcare costs. The HI [Trust Fund](../t/trust_fund.md) has faced looming [insolvency](../i/insolvency.md) issues [multiple](../m/multiple.md) times throughout its history. Projections for the [trust fund](../t/trust_fund.md)'s [solvency](../s/solvency.md) vary based on numerous factors, including [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md), healthcare costs, and legislative changes.

The Medicare trustees report, published annually, provides a detailed analysis of the financial status of the HI [Trust Fund](../t/trust_fund.md), including a projection of when the [trust fund](../t/trust_fund.md) is expected to become insolvent if no changes are made. [Insolvency](../i/insolvency.md) does not mean that the [trust fund](../t/trust_fund.md) [will](../w/will.md) be entirely out of [money](../m/money.md) or unable to pay any benefits, but rather that it [will](../w/will.md) not have sufficient funds to cover 100% of anticipated costs.

### Potential Solutions for Ensuring Solvency

Various solutions have been proposed and debated to ensure the long-term [solvency](../s/solvency.md) of the HI [Trust Fund](../t/trust_fund.md). These potential solutions include:

1. **Adjusting [Payroll Tax](../p/payroll_tax.md) Rates**: One straightforward approach is to increase the [payroll tax](../p/payroll_tax.md) rate, thereby increasing [revenue](../r/revenue.md) flowing into the HI [Trust Fund](../t/trust_fund.md).
2. **Raising the Medicare Eligibility Age**: By raising the age at which individuals become eligible for Medicare, expenditures could be reduced, though this approach could shift costs to other parts of the healthcare system.
3. **Reducing Payments to Providers**: Adjusting the rates at which Medicare reimburses hospitals and other healthcare providers may help reduce overall expenditures.
4. **Introducing New [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Sources**: Exploring new sources of [revenue](../r/revenue.md) for the HI [Trust Fund](../t/trust_fund.md), such as a surtax on higher-[income](../i/income.md) individuals or dedicated funds from other areas, could also contribute to the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s [solvency](../s/solvency.md).
5. **Encouraging Cost-[Efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and Savings in Healthcare**: Implementing measures that promote cost-[efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) in the delivery of healthcare services, such as reducing waste and [fraud](../f/fraud.md), could help reduce expenditures without sacrificing quality of care.

## Conclusion

The Hospital [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) [Trust Fund](../t/trust_fund.md) plays a crucial role in [financing](../f/financing.md) Medicare Part A services for millions of Americans. Ensuring its long-term [solvency](../s/solvency.md) is essential for maintaining the sustainability and reliability of the Medicare program. Policymakers and stakeholders continue to explore a [range](../r/range.md) of strategies and reforms to address financial challenges and support the [trust fund](../t/trust_fund.md)'s ability to meet the healthcare needs of present and future beneficiaries.

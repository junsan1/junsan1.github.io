# Horizontal Spread

A Horizontal Spread, also known as a Calendar Spread or Time Spread, is an options strategy involving the purchase of one option and the simultaneous sale of another option of the same underlying asset, the same strike price, but with a different expiration date. This can be executed using either call options or [put options](../p/put_options.md). The primary aim of a horizontal spread is to benefit from volatility and time decay while minimizing the impact of price movements in the underlying asset.

## Key Components of Horizontal Spread

1. **Underlying Asset**: The financial instrument (e.g., stock, index) on which the options are based.
2. **Strike Price**: The predetermined price at which the underlying asset can be bought or sold as per the options contract.
3. **Expiration Date**: The date on which the options contract expires. Horizontal spreads involve options with different expiration dates.
4. **Premium**: Cost associated with purchasing the option.

## Types of Horizontal Spreads

1. **Call Horizontal Spread**: Involves buying and selling call options with different expiration dates.
2. **Put Horizontal Spread**: Involves buying and selling [put options](../p/put_options.md) with different expiration dates.

## Construction of a Horizontal Spread

### Example

Assume an underlying stock, XYZ, trading at $100. A trader could set up a horizontal spread as follows:

- **Buy 1 XYZ Call Option** with a strike price of $105 expiring in 3 months.
- **Sell 1 XYZ Call Option** with a strike price of $105 expiring in 1 month.

## Payoff and Profit/Loss Analysis

### Payoff Structure

A horizontal spreadâ€™s payoff largely depends on the behavior of implied volatility and the movement of the stock price relative to the strike price.

- **At Expiration**: If the underlying stock price is at or near the strike price at the expiration of the shorter-term option, the trader may profit due to the higher time decay of the shorter-term option relative to the longer-term option. Conversely, if the stock price moves significantly, the strategy could result in a loss.
- **Volatility**: The horizontal spread benefits from an increase in implied volatility, which generally increases the value of the longer-term option more than the shorter-term option.

### Real-World Example

1. **Implied Volatility**: Suppose the implied volatility (IV) of XYZ for the near-month option is 30%, and the IV for the three-month option is 35%. Increased IV benefits the strategy, whereas decreased IV hurts it.
2. **Time Decay**: The value of the short-term option will decrease faster due to time decay compared to the long-term option, potentially leading to a net gain.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

- **Limited Risk**: Horizontal spreads have a clearly defined risk limited to the net debit (initial investment) of entering the spread.
- **Profit from Time Decay**: This strategy capitalizes on the time decay (theta) difference between short-term and long-term options.
- **Benefits from Volatility**: Horizontal spreads can benefit from an increase in implied volatility.

### Disadvantages

- **Complexity**: Horizontal spreads are more complex than single-leg options strategies and require a good understanding of how options work.
- **Limited Profit Potential**: The maximum profit is capped and typically occurs when the underlying asset price is at or near the strike price at the expiration of the short option.
- **Exposure to Implied Volatility Changes**: Decreases in implied volatility can negatively affect the strategy.

## Real-Life Applications and Considerations

### Scenario 1: Earnings Season

Companies experience increased volatility during earnings reports. Traders can use horizontal spreads to bet on increased volatility without committing to directional moves.

### Scenario 2: Capitalizing on Predictable Events

Events like FDA announcements, product launches, or [geopolitical events](../g/geopolitical_events.md) can cause volatility spikes. Traders may use horizontal spreads to potentially profit from these anticipated movements.

### Key Considerations

1. **Brokerage Fees**: Given the complexity, horizontal spreads can incur higher brokerage fees. It's important to factor in these costs.
2. **Market Conditions**: Horizontal spreads perform better in certain market conditions, particularly where minimal price movement and high volatility are expected.

## Conclusion

Horizontal spreads can be an effective strategy for traders looking to profit from time decay and volatility with limited risk. While the strategy has capped profit potential, its defined risk and ability to leverage different expiration dates make it a valuable tool in options trading. Understanding the nuances of implied volatility, time decay, and market conditions is crucial for successful implementation.

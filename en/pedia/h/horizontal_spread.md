# Horizontal Spread

A Horizontal Spread, also known as a Calendar Spread or Time Spread, is an [options](../o/options.md) strategy involving the purchase of one option and the simultaneous [sale](../s/sale.md) of another option of the same [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), the same [strike price](../s/strike_price.md), but with a different [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md). This can be executed using either call [options](../o/options.md) or [put options](../p/put_options.md). The primary aim of a horizontal spread is to benefit from [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) while minimizing the impact of price movements in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

## Key Components of Horizontal Spread

1. **[Underlying Asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)**: The [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) (e.g., stock, [index](../i/index.md)) on which the [options](../o/options.md) are based.
2. **[Strike Price](../s/strike_price.md)**: The predetermined price at which the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) can be bought or sold as per the [options contract](../o/options_contract.md).
3. **[Expiration Date](../e/expiration_date.md)**: The date on which the [options contract](../o/options_contract.md) expires. Horizontal [spreads](../s/spreads.md) involve [options](../o/options.md) with different expiration dates.
4. **[Premium](../p/premium.md)**: Cost associated with purchasing the option.

## Types of Horizontal Spreads

1. **Call Horizontal Spread**: Involves buying and selling call [options](../o/options.md) with different expiration dates.
2. **Put Horizontal Spread**: Involves buying and selling [put options](../p/put_options.md) with different expiration dates.

## Construction of a Horizontal Spread

### Example

Assume an [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock, XYZ, trading at $100. A [trader](../t/trader.md) could set up a horizontal spread as follows:

- **Buy 1 XYZ [Call Option](../c/call_option.md)** with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $105 expiring in 3 months.
- **Sell 1 XYZ [Call Option](../c/call_option.md)** with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) of $105 expiring in 1 month.

## Payoff and Profit/Loss Analysis

### Payoff Structure

A horizontal spreadâ€™s payoff largely depends on the behavior of implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and the movement of the stock price relative to the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md).

- **At Expiration**: If the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock price is at or near the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) at the expiration of the shorter-term option, the [trader](../t/trader.md) may [profit](../p/profit.md) due to the higher [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) of the shorter-term option relative to the longer-term option. Conversely, if the stock price moves significantly, the strategy could result in a loss.
- **[Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: The horizontal spread benefits from an increase in implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md), which generally increases the [value](../v/value.md) of the longer-term option more than the shorter-term option.

### Real-World Example

1. **Implied [Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: Suppose the implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md) (IV) of XYZ for the near-month option is 30%, and the IV for the three-month option is 35%. Increased IV benefits the strategy, whereas decreased IV hurts it.
2. **[Time Decay](../t/time_decay.md)**: The [value](../v/value.md) of the short-term option [will](../w/will.md) decrease faster due to [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) compared to the long-term option, potentially leading to a net [gain](../g/gain.md).

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

- **Limited [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: Horizontal [spreads](../s/spreads.md) have a clearly defined [risk](../r/risk.md) limited to the net [debit](../d/debit.md) (initial investment) of entering the spread.
- **[Profit](../p/profit.md) from [Time Decay](../t/time_decay.md)**: This strategy capitalizes on the [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) ([theta](../t/theta.md)) difference between short-term and long-term [options](../o/options.md).
- **Benefits from [Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: Horizontal [spreads](../s/spreads.md) can benefit from an increase in implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

### Disadvantages

- **Complexity**: Horizontal [spreads](../s/spreads.md) are more complex than single-[leg](../l/leg.md) [options](../o/options.md) strategies and require a good understanding of how [options](../o/options.md) work.
- **Limited [Profit](../p/profit.md) Potential**: The maximum [profit](../p/profit.md) is capped and typically occurs when the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) price is at or near the [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) at the expiration of the short option.
- **Exposure to Implied [Volatility](../v/volatility.md) Changes**: Decreases in implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md) can negatively affect the strategy.

## Real-Life Applications and Considerations

### Scenario 1: Earnings Season

Companies experience increased [volatility](../v/volatility.md) during [earnings](../e/earnings.md) reports. Traders can use horizontal [spreads](../s/spreads.md) to bet on increased [volatility](../v/volatility.md) without committing to directional moves.

### Scenario 2: Capitalizing on Predictable Events

Events like FDA announcements, product launches, or [geopolitical events](../g/geopolitical_events.md) can cause [volatility](../v/volatility.md) spikes. Traders may use horizontal [spreads](../s/spreads.md) to potentially [profit](../p/profit.md) from these anticipated movements.

### Key Considerations

1. **Brokerage Fees**: Given the complexity, horizontal [spreads](../s/spreads.md) can incur higher brokerage fees. It's important to [factor](../f/factor.md) in these costs.
2. **[Market](../m/market.md) Conditions**: Horizontal [spreads](../s/spreads.md) perform better in certain [market](../m/market.md) conditions, particularly where minimal price movement and high [volatility](../v/volatility.md) are expected.

## Tools and Platforms for Managing Horizontal Spreads

Several tools and platforms help traders execute and manage horizontal [spreads](../s/spreads.md). Some notable ones include:

1. **[Thinkorswim](../t/thinkorswim.md) by TD [Ameritrade](../a/ameritrade.md)**: Offers advanced [options](../o/options.md) trading capabilities and analytical tools. [TD Ameritrade](https://www.tdameritrade.com/tools-and-platforms/thinkorswim.page)
2. **[Interactive Brokers](../i/interactive_brokers.md)**: Provides [robust](../r/robust.md) [options](../o/options.md) trading features and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) tools. [Interactive Brokers](https://www.interactivebrokers.com)

## Conclusion

Horizontal [spreads](../s/spreads.md) can be an effective strategy for traders looking to [profit](../p/profit.md) from [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) and [volatility](../v/volatility.md) with limited [risk](../r/risk.md). While the strategy has capped [profit](../p/profit.md) potential, its defined [risk](../r/risk.md) and ability to [leverage](../l/leverage.md) different expiration dates make it a valuable tool in [options](../o/options.md) trading. Understanding the nuances of implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md), [time decay](../t/time_decay.md), and [market](../m/market.md) conditions is crucial for successful implementation.

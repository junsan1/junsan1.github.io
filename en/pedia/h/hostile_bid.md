# Hostile Bid

A hostile bid is an attempt to take over a company without the consent of the company's board of directors. Unlike friendly acquisitions where the management of both companies work together towards a mutually beneficial agreement, hostile bids involve acquirers attempting to bypass, undermine, or directly oppose the target company's management. Hostile bids can be aggressive and contentious, often involving strategic maneuvering and various financial tactics to persuade or pressure shareholders to accept the bid. 

## Mechanisms of Hostile Bids

### Tender Offer

A tender offer involves the acquirer making a bid directly to the shareholders of the target company, offering to purchase their shares at a premium price. This approach bypasses the company's board of directors and appeals directly to the shareholders who might be more willing to sell their shares for the premium.

### Proxy Fight

In a proxy fight, the acquirer seeks to control the target company by encouraging shareholders to vote for a new board of directors that is sympathetic to the acquirer's goals. Proxy fights involve persuading or lobbying shareholders to support the acquirer's slate of board candidates, which can be a complex and expensive endeavor.

### Creep Acquisition

A creep acquisition strategy involves the gradual purchase of the target company's shares on the open market. By steadily accumulating shares, the acquirer can gain influence over the company without initially drawing much attention. Once a significant stake is obtained, the acquirer might push for changes in management or policies that favor a takeover.

## Defense Mechanisms Against Hostile Bids

### Poison Pill

A poison pill is a defense strategy where the target company makes its stock less attractive to the acquirer. This can be achieved by allowing existing shareholders (except the acquirer) to purchase additional shares at a discount, thus diluting the acquirer's stake and making the takeover more expensive.

### Golden Parachute

A golden parachute involves offering lucrative benefits to senior executives if they lose their positions due to a takeover. This can make the takeover more costly for the acquirer, as they would need to cover these substantial costs.

### White Knight

A white knight is a friendly company that the target company's board prefers as an alternative acquirer. The target company might encourage a white knight to make a competing bid, which is often more aligned with the target company's strategic goals.

### Litigation

Legal action can also be a defense against hostile bids. The target company might file lawsuits to delay the process, make the takeover more expensive, and potentially find breaches of regulatory compliances by the bidding company.

## Real-World Examples

### Valeant Pharmaceuticals and Allergan

One notable hostile bid was made by Valeant Pharmaceuticals for Allergan in 2014. Valeant, in collaboration with activist investor Pershing Square Capital Management, launched a $53 billion hostile bid for Allergan. The bid was eventually fended off when Allergan found a white knight in Actavis, which merged with Allergan in a friendly deal valued at $66 billion. [Allergan](https://www.allergan.com/) 

### Kraft Heinz and Unilever

In 2017, Kraft Heinz made an unsolicited offer to acquire Unilever for $143 billion. The bid was rejected by Unilever, leading to a brief but intense period of aggressive maneuvering. Kraft Heinz eventually withdrew its proposal, demonstrating how target companies can successfully fend off unsolicited offers. [Unilever](https://www.unilever.com/)

### Sanofi and Genzyme

In 2010, French pharmaceutical company Sanofi launched a $18.5 billion hostile bid for U.S. biotechnology firm Genzyme. After a lengthy struggle, the two companies agreed on a friendly deal valued at $20.1 billion. This case underscores how an initial hostile bid can sometimes transform into a negotiated agreement.

## Regulatory Environment

### United States

In the United States, the regulatory environment for hostile bids is overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Williams Act regulates tender offers, providing rules for disclosure, timing, and procedural requirements. Companies also need to comply with various state laws, which can offer additional protections to target companies.

### European Union

In the European Union, the regulatory landscape is characterized by the EU Takeover Directive, which aims to provide a framework for takeover bids across member states. The directive seeks to harmonize rules, protect minority shareholders, and ensure transparency. However, individual countries within the EU may have additional regulations that influence takeovers.

### Japan

In Japan, the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (FIEA) governs hostile bids. The regulatory framework in Japan emphasizes transparency and fairness, requiring detailed disclosures and adherence to strict procedural guidelines. Defensive measures, such as poison pills, are also subject to judicial scrutiny in Japan.

## Strategic Implications

### Acquirer Perspective

From the acquirer's perspective, a hostile bid can be a strategic move to gain control of a valuable asset or expand market presence. Hostile bids might be pursued if the target's management is resistant to a merger or acquisition in a friendly manner. However, hostile bids can be costly, time-consuming, and potentially damaging to the acquirer's reputation.

### Target Company Perspective

For the target company, a hostile bid poses a significant threat. Management must quickly develop and implement defensive strategies to protect the company's interests. Hostile bids can create uncertainty, impact employee morale, and disrupt business operations. However, they can also force management to re-evaluate company strategies and potentially lead to better offers or improvements.

## Financial and Market Impact

### Shareholder Wealth

Hostile bids often lead to significant short-term increases in the target company's stock price, as the offer price usually includes a premium. This can benefit shareholders who sell their shares at the elevated price. However, long-term impacts on shareholder wealth depend on the outcome of the bid and the subsequent performance of the company.

### Market Perception

Hostile bids can influence market perceptions and investor confidence. Successful hostile takeovers can be seen as aggressive and may lead to further consolidation within the industry. Conversely, failed hostile bids might result in negative market sentiment towards both the acquirer and the target.

### Regulatory Scrutiny

Both the acquirer and the target company must navigate complex regulatory scrutiny during a hostile bid. Regulatory bodies are responsible for ensuring compliance with laws, protecting shareholder interests, and maintaining market stability. Intense regulatory scrutiny can impact the timeline and feasibility of a hostile bid.

## Conclusion

Hostile bids represent a dramatic aspect of corporate mergers and acquisitions, marked by aggressive tactics, complex strategies, and significant financial implications. While they offer a pathway for acquirers to gain control of valuable assets, they also pose substantial risks and challenges. Both acquirers and target companies must carefully navigate the legal, financial, and strategic landscape to achieve their objectives in the face of a hostile bid.

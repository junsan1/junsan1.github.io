Detailed information about blocks, deployable chaincodes, and transactions can be accessed. This includes timestamp, [transaction](../t/transaction.md) types, [transaction](../t/transaction.md) IDs, payloads, and endorsements.

## Architecture

[Hyperledger](../h/hyperledger.md) Explorer has a modular and layered architecture making it scalable and flexible. Here’s a detailed look at the different layers:

### User Interface Layer

The user interface layer is built using modern web development frameworks such as Angular or React. This layer is responsible for rendering the visual components of the dashboard.

### Middleware Layer

The middleware layer handles communication between the user interface and the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) network. This layer is developed using Node.js and Express.js, providing RESTful APIs for ease of integration and enhancing performance.

### Blockchain Platform Layer

This layer includes the [Hyperledger Fabric](../h/hyperledger_fabric.md) SDK and other [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) interaction modules. It's responsible for interfacing directly with the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) nodes, endorsers, and orderers to fetch the necessary data.

### Data Storage

Data is stored in a relational database like PostgreSQL. This allows for efficient querying, [indexing](../i/indexing.md), and storage of [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) data.

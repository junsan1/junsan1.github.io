# Hard Call Protection

**Hard Call Protection** is a technical term in the context of fixed-[income](../i/income.md) securities, specifically regarding callable bonds. A [callable bond](../c/callable_bond.md) is a type of [bond](../b/bond.md) that allows the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) to repay the [bond](../b/bond.md) before it reaches its [maturity date](../m/maturity_date.md) at a predefined call price. Hard call protection is a crucial feature that provides investors with protection against the [risk](../r/risk.md) of the [bond](../b/bond.md) being called away before a certain date.

## Understanding Hard Call Protection

Hard call protection, also known as an absolute or lockout protection period, is a set period during which a [callable bond](../c/callable_bond.md) cannot be called by the [issuer](../i/issuer.md). This period is typically specified in the [bond](../b/bond.md)â€™s [indenture](../i/indenture.md) and offers a certain level of [security](../s/security.md) to bondholders by guaranteeing that they [will](../w/will.md) receive [interest](../i/interest.md) payments for a minimum period. 

During the hard call protection period, the [bond](../b/bond.md) cannot be redeemed regardless of [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) movements or other [market](../m/market.md) conditions. This protection is crucial for bondholders, particularly in a declining [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) environment. Without such protection, bondholders face the [risk](../r/risk.md) of [reinvestment](../r/reinvestment.md) at lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates if the [bond](../b/bond.md) is called early.

## Importance of Hard Call Protection

1. **[Interest](../i/interest.md) [Payment](../p/payment.md) [Assurance](../a/assurance.md)**: Investors are assured of receiving [interest](../i/interest.md) payments for a specific period. This protection is valuable, especially when [interest](../i/interest.md) rates are volatile.
2. **Reduction of [Reinvestment Risk](../r/reinvestment_risk.md)**: Hard call protection safeguards investors from the [risk](../r/risk.md) of having to reinvest at lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, which typically happens in a declining [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) environment where issuers are more likely to call their bonds to reissue new ones at lower rates.
3. **Investment Planning**: It allows investors to plan their investments more effectively, knowing they [will](../w/will.md) receive returns for a specific period without the [risk](../r/risk.md) of early [redemption](../r/redemption.md).
4. **Attractiveness to Investors**: Bonds with hard call protection often attract more investors, as the certainty of cash flows and interests appeals more to [risk-averse](../r/risk-averse.md) investors.

## How Hard Call Protection Works

Consider a hypothetical [callable bond](../c/callable_bond.md) issued by a company, ABC Corp., with the following details:

- **[Face Value](../f/face_value.md)**: $1,000
- **[Coupon Rate](../c/coupon_rate.md)**: 5%
- **[Maturity Date](../m/maturity_date.md)**: January 1, 2030
- **Call Date**: January 1, 2025
- **Hard Call Protection Period**: 5 years from issuance (until January 1, 2025)

In this example, the [bond](../b/bond.md) is issued on January 1, 2020. The hard call protection period guarantees the [bond](../b/bond.md) cannot be called before January 1, 2025. During these five years, investors [will](../w/will.md) receive their coupon payments without the [risk](../r/risk.md) of the [bond](../b/bond.md) being redeemed early. After the hard call protection period ends, ABC Corp. has the right but not the obligation to call the [bond](../b/bond.md) at the call price, typically set at a [premium](../p/premium.md) over the [face value](../f/face_value.md).

## Differences Between Hard and Soft Call Protection

While hard call protection offers absolute protection against early [redemption](../r/redemption.md), soft call protection provides conditional protection. Soft call protection might impose penalties or premiums if the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) calls the [bond](../b/bond.md) within a certain period. For example, a [bond](../b/bond.md) with soft call protection might allow the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) to call the [bond](../b/bond.md) within the first five years but require the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) to pay a [premium](../p/premium.md) above the [face value](../f/face_value.md).

### Example of Soft Call Protection

A [bond](../b/bond.md) with soft call protection might have these features:

- **[Face Value](../f/face_value.md)**: $1,000
- **[Coupon Rate](../c/coupon_rate.md)**: 5%
- **[Maturity Date](../m/maturity_date.md)**: January 1, 2030
- **Call Date**: Any time after issuance
- **Soft Call Protection**: 3% [premium](../p/premium.md) if called within the first 3 years

In this example, the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) can call the [bond](../b/bond.md) at any time, but if they do so within the first three years, they must pay a 3% [premium](../p/premium.md) over the [face value](../f/face_value.md), making the call price $1,030 per [bond](../b/bond.md).

## Examples of Bonds with Hard Call Protection

Many corporate and [municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md) come with hard call protection to make them more attractive to investors. For example, high-[yield](../y/yield.md) corporate bonds often include this feature to compensate investors for the higher [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with lower [credit](../c/credit.md) ratings. [Municipal bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md) might also have hard call protection to ensure steady [income](../i/income.md) for investors.

### Corporate Bond Example

- **[Issuer](../i/issuer.md)**: XYZ Corp.
- **[Face Value](../f/face_value.md)**: $2,000
- **[Coupon Rate](../c/coupon_rate.md)**: 6%
- **[Maturity Date](../m/maturity_date.md)**: December 31, 2028
- **Hard Call Protection Period**: 7 years from issuance

In this case, if the [bond](../b/bond.md) is issued on January 1, 2021, XYZ Corp. cannot call the [bond](../b/bond.md) before January 1, 2028.

### Municipal Bond Example

- **[Issuer](../i/issuer.md)**: City of Exampleville
- **[Face Value](../f/face_value.md)**: $5,000
- **[Coupon Rate](../c/coupon_rate.md)**: 4%
- **[Maturity Date](../m/maturity_date.md)**: June 30, 2035
- **Hard Call Protection Period**: 10 years from issuance

For a [bond](../b/bond.md) issued on June 30, 2020, the City of Exampleville cannot call the [bond](../b/bond.md) before June 30, 2030.

## Importance for Investors and Issuers

### For Investors

Hard call protection is a critical feature for investors who desire stable, predictable cash flows without the unpredictable [risk](../r/risk.md) of early [redemption](../r/redemption.md). It is a particularly attractive feature for:

- **[Income](../i/income.md)-Focused Investors**: Those who rely on regular [interest](../i/interest.md) payments.
- **[Risk-Averse](../r/risk-averse.md) Investors**: Those who prefer the [security](../s/security.md) of knowing that their [bond](../b/bond.md) [will](../w/will.md) not be called away early.
- **Institutional Investors**: Entities like pension funds and [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies that need to match [long-term liabilities](../l/long-term_liabilities.md) with [long-term assets](../l/long-term_assets.md).

### For Issuers

While hard call protection is beneficial for investors, it can be a double-edged sword for issuers:

- **[Market](../m/market.md) Conditions**: If [interest](../i/interest.md) rates decrease significantly, issuers may wish to retire high-[interest](../i/interest.md) [debt](../d/debt.md) and reissue new [debt](../d/debt.md) at lower rates. Hard call protection restricts this flexibility.
- **[Investor](../i/investor.md) [Demand](../d/demand.md)**: Including hard call protection can attract more investors but may come at the cost of higher coupon rates given the increased [security](../s/security.md) offered.

## Market Trends and Examples

Hard call protection trends can be influenced by broader [market](../m/market.md) conditions. For instance:

- **Rising [Interest](../i/interest.md) Rates**: In environments with rising [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, investors might accept bonds with shorter hard call protection periods as the probability of the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) calling the bonds decreases.
- **[Credit](../c/credit.md) [Market](../m/market.md) Conditions**: In periods of economic [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md), bonds with hard call protection become more attractive as they [offer](../o/offer.md) stability.

### Companies Offering Bonds with Hard Call Protection

Many companies and municipalities include hard call protection in their [bond](../b/bond.md) offerings. Examples include:

- **Apple Inc.**: Known for issuing corporate bonds with attractive terms. More details can be found on their [Investor Relations page](https://investor.apple.com/investor-relations/default.aspx).
- **General Electric**: Another prominent [issuer](../i/issuer.md) in the [corporate bond](../c/corporate_bond.md) [market](../m/market.md). Details can be explored on the [General Electric Investor Relations page](https://www.ge.com/investor-relations).
- **City of New York [Municipal Bonds](../m/municipal_bonds.md)**: Often come with hard call protection features. Information can be accessed through the [New York City Municipal Water Finance Authority](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nyw/investor/investor-information.page).

## Conclusion

Hard call protection is a vital feature in the world of fixed-[income](../i/income.md) securities, providing investors with the [security](../s/security.md) of fixed [interest](../i/interest.md) payments for a guaranteed period. While beneficial to investors by reducing [reinvestment](../r/reinvestment.md) risks and [offering](../o/offering.md) predictable cash flows, it imposes certain limitations on issuers regarding their ability to [refinance](../r/refinance.md) [debt](../d/debt.md) during periods of favorable [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

Understanding hard call protection allows investors to make informed decisions about [bond](../b/bond.md) investments, ensuring that their portfolio aligns with their [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) and [income](../i/income.md) requirements.

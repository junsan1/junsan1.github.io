# Hyperledger Sawtooth

Hyperledger Sawtooth is an enterprise blockchain platform designed for creating and deploying scalable distributed ledgers. It is an open-source project under the Linux Foundation's Hyperledger umbrella, aimed at advancing cross-industry blockchain technologies. Sawtooth separates the core system from the application domain, providing flexibility to develop solutions across various areas. Its salient features include modularity, scalability, and a focus on parallel transaction execution, making it highly efficient for different use cases.

## Key Features of Hyperledger Sawtooth

### Modularity
Sawtooth's architecture is highly modular, allowing developers to swap elements without affecting the overall system. This modularity enables customization and flexibility in developing blockchain solutions.

### Parallel Transaction Execution
One of the standout features of Sawtooth is its implementation of parallel transaction execution through its innovative consensus algorithm known as Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET). This feature significantly enhances the efficiency and scalability of the network compared to traditional blockchain systems that execute transactions sequentially.

### Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET)
PoET is a consensus mechanism developed by Intel, which aims to provide a fair and energy-efficient solution similar to Proof of Work (PoW) without requiring excessive computational power. PoET uses a trusted execution environment (TEE) to ensure secure and random leader election, making it a suitable choice for enterprise applications.

### Dynamic Consensus
Sawtooth supports not only PoET but also other consensus algorithms like Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT). The platform allows for dynamic consensus, meaning the consensus algorithm can be switched without stopping the network.

### Pluggable Consensus
In addition to dynamic consensus, Sawtooth's pluggable consensus architecture enables developers to define and implement their consensus mechanisms suited to specific needs. This flexibility allows Sawtooth to cater to diverse use cases and industries.

### Smart Contract Support
Sawtooth supports smart contracts, enabling the deployment of decentralized applications (dApps). Sawtooth smart contracts can be written in various languages, including Python, JavaScript, and Go, providing developers with the flexibility to choose a language they are comfortable with.

### Transaction Families
A unique aspect of Sawtooth is its concept of "Transaction Families." These are sets of transaction types that specify the operations that can be performed on the ledger. For example, the IntegerKey transaction family allows simple key-value pair operations. Developers can create custom transaction families tailored to their specific application requirements.

### State Management
Sawtooth manages the state using a Merkle-Radix tree which combines the properties of Radix trees and Merkle trees. This approach ensures efficient state storage, retrieval, and verification, making it suitable for enterprise-grade applications.

### Security
Security is a paramount focus in Sawtooth's design. The platform leverages strong cryptographic protocols and trusted execution environments to ensure data integrity and secure transaction processing. Additionally, Sawtooth's modular architecture offers enhanced security by isolating different components.

## Architecture

### Component Overview
Hyperledger Sawtooth's architecture comprises several key components:

- **Validator**: Core component responsible for maintaining the blockchain, verifying transactions, and executing the consensus algorithm.
- **Transaction Processor**: Implements the logic for specific transaction families.
- **Rest API**: Provides an interface for external applications to interact with the blockchain.
- **Consensus Engine**: Manages the consensus algorithm and ensures the network reaches an agreement on the state of the ledger.
- **State**: Stores the blockchain's state using a Merkle-Radix tree.

### Transaction Flow
1. **Submission**: A client submits a transaction to the validator.
2. **Validation**: The validator forwards the transaction to the Transaction Processor for validation.
3. **Execution**: If the transaction is valid, it is executed, and the state is updated.
4. **Consensus**: The consensus engine ensures that all nodes agree on the transaction's results.
5. **Block Addition**: Valid transactions are added to a new block, which is appended to the blockchain.

### Consensus Mechanisms

#### Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET)
PoET uses a random leader election process run inside a trusted execution environment (TEE) to ensure fairness and security. Each node requests a wait time from the TEE, and the one with the shortest wait time wins the leadership. This method reduces energy consumption compared to traditional PoW.

#### Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)
PBFT is a consensus algorithm designed for permissioned networks where participants are known and trusted to some extent. It ensures fault tolerance up to \\((n-1)/3\\) faulty nodes in a network of \\(n\\) nodes.

## Use Cases

### Supply Chain Management
Sawtooth's modularity and scalability make it an excellent fit for supply chain management solutions. It enables transparent tracking of goods, efficient management of supply chain transactions, and reduces the risk of fraud.

### Digital Identity
Digital identity solutions benefit from Sawtooth's security and privacy features. It provides a secure platform for managing and verifying digital identities, ensuring data integrity and preventing unauthorized access.

### Financial Services
Financial institutions can leverage Sawtooth for secure and efficient transaction processing, reducing settlement times and costs. Its support for smart contracts enables automation of financial processes, increasing transparency and reducing the risk of errors.

### Healthcare
In healthcare, Sawtooth can be used to securely manage patient records, ensuring data privacy and integrity. It also facilitates the secure sharing of medical data between stakeholders, enhancing collaboration and improving patient care.

### Asset Tracking
Sawtooth enables efficient tracking of physical and digital assets across various industries. Its transparent and tamper-proof ledger ensures accurate record-keeping and reduces the risk of fraud.

## Getting Started with Hyperledger Sawtooth

### Prerequisites
Before setting up Hyperledger Sawtooth, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of blockchain concepts.

### Setting Up a Sawtooth Network
1. **Clone the Sawtooth Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core.git
   cd sawtooth-core
   ```

2. **Start the Network Using Docker Compose**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker/compose/smallbank.yaml up
   ```

3. **Submit Transactions**:
   Use the Sawtooth CLI or REST API to submit transactions to the network.

### Writing Smart Contracts
Sawtooth supports different languages for smart contract development. Hereâ€™s an example of writing a simple smart contract in Python:

1. **Create a Transaction Processor**:
   ```python
   from sawtooth_sdk.processor.handler import TransactionHandler
   
   class SimpleHandler(TransactionHandler):
       def __init__(self):
           super().__init__(
               family_name='simple',
               family_versions=['1.0'],
               namespaces=['simple'])
       
       def apply(self, transaction, context):
           # Implement the transaction logic here
           pass
   ```

2. **Register the Handler**:
   ```python
   from sawtooth_sdk.processor.core import TransactionProcessor
   
   processor = TransactionProcessor(url='tcp://localhost:4004')
   handler = SimpleHandler()
   processor.add_handler(handler)
   processor.start()
   ```

3. **Deploy the Processor**:
   Deploy the smart contract by running the transaction processor. The transactions sent to the network will now be processed by this custom logic.

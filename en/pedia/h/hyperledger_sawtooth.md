# Hyperledger Sawtooth

[Hyperledger](../h/hyperledger.md) Sawtooth is an enterprise [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) platform designed for creating and deploying scalable [distributed ledgers](../d/distributed_ledgers.md). It is an [open](../o/open.md)-source project under the Linux Foundation's [Hyperledger](../h/hyperledger.md) umbrella, aimed at advancing cross-[industry](../i/industry.md) [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technologies. Sawtooth separates the core system from the application domain, providing flexibility to develop solutions across various areas. Its salient features include modularity, [scalability](../s/scalability.md), and a focus on parallel [transaction execution](../t/transaction_execution.md), making it highly efficient for different use cases.

## Key Features of Hyperledger Sawtooth

### Modularity
Sawtooth's architecture is highly modular, allowing developers to [swap](../s/swap.md) elements without affecting the overall system. This modularity enables customization and flexibility in developing [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) solutions.

### Parallel Transaction Execution
One of the standout features of Sawtooth is its implementation of parallel [transaction execution](../t/transaction_execution.md) through its innovative consensus algorithm known as Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET). This feature significantly enhances the [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and [scalability](../s/scalability.md) of the network compared to traditional [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) systems that execute transactions sequentially.

### Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET)
PoET is a consensus mechanism developed by Intel, which aims to provide a fair and energy-efficient solution similar to Proof of Work (PoW) without requiring excessive computational power. PoET uses a trusted [execution](../e/execution.md) environment (TEE) to ensure secure and random leader election, making it a suitable choice for enterprise applications.

### Dynamic Consensus
Sawtooth supports not only PoET but also other consensus algorithms like Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT). The platform allows for dynamic consensus, meaning the consensus algorithm can be switched without stopping the network.

### Pluggable Consensus
In addition to dynamic consensus, Sawtooth's pluggable consensus architecture enables developers to define and implement their consensus mechanisms suited to specific needs. This flexibility allows Sawtooth to cater to diverse use cases and industries.

### Smart Contract Support
Sawtooth supports [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md), enabling the deployment of decentralized applications (dApps). Sawtooth [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md) can be written in various languages, including Python, JavaScript, and Go, providing developers with the flexibility to choose a language they are comfortable with.

### Transaction Families
A unique aspect of Sawtooth is its concept of "[Transaction](../t/transaction.md) Families." These are sets of [transaction](../t/transaction.md) types that specify the operations that can be performed on the ledger. For example, the IntegerKey [transaction](../t/transaction.md) family allows simple key-[value](../v/value.md) pair operations. Developers can create custom [transaction](../t/transaction.md) families tailored to their specific application requirements.

### State Management
Sawtooth manages the state using a Merkle-Radix tree which combines the properties of Radix trees and Merkle trees. This approach ensures efficient state storage, retrieval, and verification, making it suitable for enterprise-grade applications.

### Security
[Security](../s/security.md) is a paramount focus in Sawtooth's design. The platform leverages strong cryptographic protocols and trusted [execution](../e/execution.md) environments to ensure data integrity and secure [transaction](../t/transaction.md) processing. Additionally, Sawtooth's modular architecture offers enhanced [security](../s/security.md) by isolating different components.

## Architecture

### Component Overview
[Hyperledger](../h/hyperledger.md) Sawtooth's architecture comprises several key components:

- **Validator**: Core component responsible for maintaining the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md), verifying transactions, and executing the consensus algorithm.
- **[Transaction](../t/transaction.md) Processor**: Implements the logic for specific [transaction](../t/transaction.md) families.
- **Rest API**: Provides an interface for external applications to interact with the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md).
- **Consensus Engine**: Manages the consensus algorithm and ensures the network reaches an agreement on the state of the ledger.
- **State**: Stores the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md)'s state using a Merkle-Radix tree.

### Transaction Flow
1. **Submission**: A client submits a [transaction](../t/transaction.md) to the validator.
2. **Validation**: The validator forwards the [transaction](../t/transaction.md) to the [Transaction](../t/transaction.md) Processor for validation.
3. **[Execution](../e/execution.md)**: If the [transaction](../t/transaction.md) is valid, it is executed, and the state is updated.
4. **Consensus**: The consensus engine ensures that all nodes agree on the [transaction](../t/transaction.md)'s results.
5. **Block Addition**: Valid transactions are added to a new block, which is appended to the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md).

### Consensus Mechanisms

#### Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET)
PoET uses a random leader election process run inside a trusted [execution](../e/execution.md) environment (TEE) to ensure fairness and [security](../s/security.md). Each node requests a wait time from the TEE, and the one with the shortest wait time wins the [leadership](../l/leadership.md). This method reduces energy consumption compared to traditional PoW.

#### Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)
PBFT is a consensus algorithm designed for permissioned networks where participants are known and trusted to some extent. It ensures fault tolerance up to \\((n-1)/3\\) faulty nodes in a network of \\(n\\) nodes.

## Use Cases

### Supply Chain Management
Sawtooth's modularity and [scalability](../s/scalability.md) make it an excellent fit for [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md) management solutions. It enables transparent tracking of goods, efficient management of [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md) transactions, and reduces the [risk](../r/risk.md) of [fraud](../f/fraud.md).

### Digital Identity
Digital identity solutions benefit from Sawtooth's [security](../s/security.md) and privacy features. It provides a secure platform for managing and verifying digital identities, ensuring data integrity and preventing unauthorized access.

### Financial Services
Financial institutions can [leverage](../l/leverage.md) Sawtooth for secure and efficient [transaction](../t/transaction.md) processing, reducing settlement times and costs. Its support for [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md) enables automation of financial processes, increasing [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and reducing the [risk](../r/risk.md) of errors.

# Homeowners Protection Act

## Introduction

The Homeowners Protection Act (HPA), also known as the Private [Mortgage Insurance](../m/mortgage_insurance.md) (PMI) Cancellation Act, was enacted in 1998 by the United States Congress to address the persistent problem that many homeowners faced with unwanted and often unnecessary PMI costs. The main purpose of the HPA is to provide homeowners with the right to cancel PMI under certain circumstances, thereby potentially saving them thousands of dollars over the life of their [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md). 

## What is Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI)?

Private [Mortgage Insurance](../m/mortgage_insurance.md) is a type of [insurance](../i/insurance.md) that lenders require from homebuyers who [finance](../f/finance.md) more than 80% of their [home](../h/home.md)’s [value](../v/value.md). In other words, if a homebuyer puts down less than a 20% [down payment](../d/down_payment.md), they typically must pay for PMI. PMI protects the [lender](../l/lender.md) in case the borrower defaults on the [loan](../l/loan.md). 

Even though PMI protects the [lender](../l/lender.md) and not the borrower, the cost is borne by the borrower. This can add hundreds of dollars to the monthly [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [payment](../p/payment.md). While PMI can make it possible for borrowers to purchase a [home](../h/home.md) with a smaller [down payment](../d/down_payment.md), it can also become a significant financial burden.

## Key Provisions of the Homeowners Protection Act

### Automatic PMI Cancellation

One of the most significant aspects of the HPA is the mandate that lenders must automatically cancel PMI when the borrower’s [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) balance reaches 78% of the original [value](../v/value.md) of the [home](../h/home.md) ([loan](../l/loan.md)-to-[value](../v/value.md) ratio of 78%) and the borrower is current on their [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) payments. This [provision](../p/provision.md) removes the onerous task from the borrower of having to request cancellation, as it is done automatically by the [lender](../l/lender.md).

### Borrower-Initiated PMI Cancellation

The HPA also allows borrowers to request PMI cancellation once their [loan](../l/loan.md) balance reaches 80% of the original [value](../v/value.md) of the [home](../h/home.md), meaning they have built up at least 20% [equity](../e/equity.md). To initiate this cancellation, the homeowner must send a request to their [lender](../l/lender.md) and the following conditions must generally be met:
- The homeowner must have a good [payment](../p/payment.md) history (no late payments).
- The property must not have any junior liens (like a second [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)).
- The homeowner must provide evidence (such as a professional [appraisal](../a/appraisal.md)) that the [home](../h/home.md) [value](../v/value.md) has not declined below its original [value](../v/value.md).

### Final Termination

If PMI has not been canceled by automatic cancellation or borrower-initiated cancellation, the HPA also provides for final termination of PMI at the halfway point of the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) term. For example, on a 30-year [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md), PMI must be terminated after 15 years, irrespective of the [loan](../l/loan.md) balance or property [value](../v/value.md). This ensures that homeowners are not stuck paying for PMI for the entirety of the [loan](../l/loan.md) term.

## Covered Loans

The Homeowners Protection Act applies to residential [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) loans on a single-family [home](../h/home.md) or a multi-family dwelling with fewer than five units, and includes both primary and secondary homes. However, it is important to [note](../n/note.md) that the HPA does not cover loans covered by government [mortgage insurance](../m/mortgage_insurance.md) such as FHA loans or VA loans.

## Exclusions

Some [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) loans, particularly those considered high-[risk](../r/risk.md), may not be subject to the same PMI cancellation rules. High-[risk](../r/risk.md) loans may include loans on properties with reduced marketability, loans to borrowers with poor [credit](../c/credit.md) histories, and loans with non-standard terms.

## Disclosure Requirements

The HPA imposes several [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) requirements on lenders to ensure that borrowers are fully informed about PMI and their rights to cancel it. These disclosures include:
- At [loan](../l/loan.md) closing, lenders must provide a written notice explaining PMI and stating the borrower’s right to obtain cancellation.
- Annual written statements must be provided to the borrower that include information on the borrower's rights to PMI cancellation and termination.

## Impact on the Mortgage Industry

The enactment of the Homeowners Protection Act has had a significant impact on both borrowers and lenders:
- **For borrowers:** The ability to cancel PMI provides a substantial financial relief. Homeowners with sufficient [equity](../e/equity.md) in their homes can cease paying PMI premiums and thus reduce their monthly [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) costs.
- **For lenders:** Compliance with the HPA has necessitated changes in lending practices and documentation. Lenders must not only follow the automatic termination rules but also respond promptly to borrower-initiated cancellation requests.

## PMI Cancellation Process

The process of canceling PMI involves several steps:
1. **Review [Loan](../l/loan.md) Documents:** Homeowners should review their [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) documents for specific terms regarding PMI cancellation.
2. **Monitor [Equity](../e/equity.md) Growth:** Keep track of the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) balance and the [home](../h/home.md)’s [value](../v/value.md) to determine when the 20% [equity](../e/equity.md) mark is reached.
3. **Request Cancellation:** When the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) balance falls to 80% of the [home](../h/home.md)'s original [value](../v/value.md), homeowners can submit a written request to their [lender](../l/lender.md) asking for PMI cancellation.
4. **Provide Proof of [Value](../v/value.md):** Lenders may require a professional [appraisal](../a/appraisal.md) to confirm that the current [home](../h/home.md) [value](../v/value.md) meets necessary criteria.
5. **Stay Current on Payments:** Ensure all [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) payments are up to date, as delinquencies can delay the cancellation process.

## Common Questions and Concerns

### How long does PMI last?

PMI typically lasts until the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) balance is paid down to 78% of the [home](../h/home.md)'s original [value](../v/value.md). However, borrowers can request cancellation once the balance is at 80%, provided they meet other requirements.

### Can PMI be reinstated?

Under certain circumstances, lenders can reinstate PMI if the homeowner fails to maintain required [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) conditions, such as allowing a second [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) that affects the [equity](../e/equity.md) position or becoming [delinquent](../d/delinquent.md) on payments.

### Does PMI affect credit scores?

PMI payments do not directly affect [credit](../c/credit.md) scores, but maintaining PMI indicates a higher [loan](../l/loan.md)-to-[value](../v/value.md) ratio which can indirectly influence [credit](../c/credit.md) worthiness assessments by lenders.

### Are there any tax benefits to PMI?

As of the writing, homeowners may be able to deduct PMI premiums as [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) on their federal tax returns, depending on their [income](../i/income.md) and [filing status](../f/filing_status.md). It's advisable to consult with a tax professional for specifics related to PMI deductibility.

## Resources for Homeowners

Homeowners seeking further information or assistance about PMI and the Homeowners Protection Act can access a [range](../r/range.md) of resources, including:

## Conclusion

The Homeowners Protection Act was implemented to rectify the long-standing [issue](../i/issue.md) of unnecessary PMI costs burdening homeowners. By establishing clear guidelines for the cancellation and termination of PMI, the HPA empowers homeowners to save significantly over the life of their loans. The Act’s provisions for [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and mandatory [lender](../l/lender.md) compliance ensure greater fairness and financial stability for millions of American homeowners.

As with any significant financial decision, understanding one's rights under the HPA and the specifics of their [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) agreement is crucial. Homeowners should actively engage with their lenders and take proactive steps to ensure they are not overpaying for PMI longer than necessary.

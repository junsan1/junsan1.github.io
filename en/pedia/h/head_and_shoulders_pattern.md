### Head and Shoulders Pattern

The Head and Shoulders pattern is a financial market analysis chart pattern that predicts a bullish-to-bearish [trend reversal](../t/trend_reversal.md). It is one of the most reliable and frequently encountered trading patterns and is used by traders across a variety of asset classes, including equities, commodities, and forex.

#### Components of the Head and Shoulders Pattern

The Head and Shoulders pattern is composed of four main parts:
1. **Left Shoulder**: This is characterized by a price increase followed by a peak and then a decline.
2. **Head**: This forms when the price rises again, creating a higher peak than the left shoulder before it declines again.
3. **Right Shoulder**: The price rises again but does not reach the high of the head before declining.
4. **Neckline**: This is a support line drawn through the lows of the left shoulder, head, and right shoulder. The neckline can be upward sloping, downward sloping, or horizontal.

#### Types of Head and Shoulders Patterns

1. **Standard (Top) Head and Shoulders Pattern**: This indicates a reversal from a bullish trend to a bearish trend. It is formed after an uptrend and signals that the asset’s price is likely to move lower.
2. **Inverse (Bottom) Head and Shoulders Pattern**: This indicates a reversal from a bearish trend to a bullish trend. It is formed after a downtrend and signals that the asset’s price is likely to move higher.

#### Psychological Background

The formation of the Head and Shoulders pattern is driven by underlying market psychology:
- **Left Shoulder**: This reflects an initial attempt to continue an uptrend or downtrend.
- **Head**: Reflects a stronger attempt to push the trend further, reaching lower lows or higher highs.
- **Right Shoulder**: Reflects a weaker attempt which fails to surpass the trend established by the head, indicating a potential exhaustion in the trend.
- **Neckline Break**: A decisive break of the neckline confirms the pattern, reflecting a shift in market sentiment.

#### How to Trade Head and Shoulders Pattern

1. **Identify the Pattern**: Spot the Left Shoulder, Head, Right Shoulder, and the Neckline.
2. **Wait for the Breakout**: Do not trade until the price breaks the neckline.
3. **Trade Entry**: Once the neckline is broken, enter a trade in the direction of the breakout.
4. **Stop Loss**: Position your stop loss above the right shoulder (for Standard pattern) or below the right shoulder (for Inverse pattern).
5. **Profit Target**: Measure the distance from the top of the head to the neckline. Project this distance from the breakout point to estimate the profit target.

#### Example of Head and Shoulders Pattern

Consider the stock price of Company XYZ:
- Left Shoulder formed at $50 with a decline to $40.
- Head formed as the price rose to $60 and fell back to $40.
- Right Shoulder formed at $45 with a subsequent decline.
- Neckline is drawn at $40.
- Upon breaking the neckline at $40, the price fell to $25, confirming the pattern.

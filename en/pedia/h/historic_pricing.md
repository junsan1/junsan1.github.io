# Historic Pricing

Historic pricing refers to the collection, storage, and analysis of historical data on the prices of financial instruments, such as [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, commodities, and currencies. This data is crucial for a variety of applications and analyses, including [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), [backtesting trading strategies](../b/backtesting_trading_strategies.md), and conducting [market research](../m/market_research.md). Here, we [will](../w/will.md) delve deeply into different aspects of historic pricing, the methodologies used to gather and analyze this data, and its applications in the field of [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md).

## Importance of Historic Pricing

Historic pricing data forms the backbone of [quantitative analysis](../q/quantitative_analysis.md) in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). Without access to high-quality and extensive historic price records, a large number of financial models and [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) would be impossible to develop or validate. Here are some primary reasons why historic pricing is indispensable:

- **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md):** By analyzing historic price data, [risk](../r/risk.md) managers can identify periods of high [volatility](../v/volatility.md), understand historical drawdowns, and estimate [value](../v/value.md)-at-[risk](../r/risk.md) (VaR) metrics.
- **[Algorithmic Trading](../a/accountability.md):** Algorithms rely on historical data to develop rules and filters that guide trading decisions. This data is used to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies.
- **[Backtesting Trading Strategies](../b/backtesting_trading_strategies.md):** Before deploying a [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) in the live [market](../m/market.md), traders and developers use historical data to simulate the strategy’s performance over past periods. This helps in assessing the strategy’s potential profitability and robustness.
- **[Market Research](../m/market_research.md):** [Market](../m/market.md) researchers use historical data to understand long-term trends, conduct econometric analyses, and build [predictive models](../p/predictive_models_in_trading.md) of price movements.

### Proprietary Data

Some trading firms and financial institutions maintain their extensive historical price databases, which they may use exclusively. These datasets are often collected through direct [market](../m/market.md) feeds and can contain additional types of information, such as [order book](../o/order_book.md) data.

## Types of Historic Pricing Data

### End-of-Day Data

End-of-day (EOD) data is the most commonly used type of historic pricing data. It includes the closing price of an [asset](../a/asset.md), along with [open](../o/open.md), high, and low prices, [volume](../v/volume.md) traded, and other relevant metrics collected at the end of a trading day.

### Intraday Data

Intraday data provides price information within a trading day, usually broken down into intervals, such as minutes, seconds, or ticks. This data includes high-frequency trading data and is critical for day traders and high-frequency [algorithmic trading strategies](../a/algorithmic_trading_strategies.md).

### Tick Data

[Tick](../t/tick.md) data records every executed [trade](../t/trade.md) with a timestamp, providing the most granular level of price information. This data is essential for [high-frequency trading algorithms](../h/high-frequency_trading_algorithms.md) that depend on the precise timing and sequencing of trades.

## Processing and Cleaning Historic Pricing Data

Unprocessed raw data often contain errors, missing values, and anomalies that can lead to inaccurate analyses and suboptimal [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). Therefore, processing and cleaning historic pricing data is a crucial step.

### Data Normalization

Normalization involves adjusting data points to a common scale, removing [gaps](../g/gap.md) caused by holidays or trading halts, and ensuring data consistency across [multiple](../m/multiple.md) sources.

### Adjusting for Corporate Actions

Stock prices are affected by corporate actions such as dividends, stock splits, mergers, and acquisitions. Adjustments need to be made to historical data to account for these actions, ensuring continuity and accuracy in analyses.

### Outlier Detection and Removal

Outlier detection algorithms identify and remove anomalies in the data that could skew results. This process involves statistical techniques such as [Z-scores](../z/z-scores_in_trading.md) or interquartile ranges to flag unusual data points.

## Storage and Management of Historic Pricing Data

### Relational Databases

Relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MS SQL Server are commonly used for storing historical pricing data. They [offer](../o/offer.md) [robust](../r/robust.md) querying capabilities and can be optimized for efficient retrieval of large datasets.

Time-series databases like InfluxDB, kdb+, and TimescaleDB are specifically designed to [handle](../h/handle.md) time-series data, such as historic pricing. They [offer](../o/offer.md) high write and read [throughput](../t/throughput.md) and efficient storage solutions.

### Cloud Storage

With the rise of [cloud computing](../c/cloud_computing_in_trading.md), many financial institutions [leverage](../l/leverage.md) cloud storage solutions provided by AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure to [handle](../h/handle.md) the vast amounts of historical pricing data. These solutions [offer](../o/offer.md) [scalability](../s/scalability.md), reliability, and advanced [data security](../d/data_security_in_trading.md).

## Applications in Algorithmic Trading

### Strategy Development

Historic pricing data is fundamental for developing [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). By analyzing past price movements, quantitative analysts can identify and model predictable patterns and trends.

### Backtesting and Forward Testing

[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) involves running a [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) on historical data to see how it would have performed over past periods. Forward testing, also known as paper trading or walk-forward testing, uses historical data from subsequent periods to validate the strategy's robustness.

### Signal Generation

Quantitative algorithms use historical data to generate [trading signals](../t/trading_signals.md). Techniques such as moving averages, [momentum indicators](../m/momentum_indicators.md), and statistical [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) rely on past price movements to trigger buy or sell actions.

### Risk Modelling

Historical pricing data helps in assessing the [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with different [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). Techniques such as Monte Carlo simulations and [stress testing](../s/stress_testing.md) rely on historical data to model potential risks.

## Conclusion

Historic pricing data serves as a pivotal foundation for a multitude of financial analyses and applications, particularly in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md). Through various sources like financial exchanges and data providers, traders and analysts [gain](../g/gain.md) access to valuable datasets that enable them to develop, backtest, and refine [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). The meticulous process of cleaning and normalizing this data further enhances its accuracy and usability, ensuring [robust](../r/robust.md) and reliable outcomes. As technology and [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) continue to evolve, the importance and [utility](../u/utility.md) of historic pricing data [will](../w/will.md) undoubtedly remain integral to the financial [industry](../i/industry.md)'s ongoing innovation and success.

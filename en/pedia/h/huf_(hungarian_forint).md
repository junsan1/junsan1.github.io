## Historical Background

The name "Forint" was derived from the city of Florence, where gold coins called "fiorino d'oro" were minted from 1252. The Hungarian forint was historically used between 1868 and 1892 before being replaced by the Hungarian korona and reintroduced again in 1946 after World War II to stabilize the economy.

### First Introduction

The first introduction of the Forint was part of the Austro-Hungarian currency system. The currency provided a dependable and stable medium of exchange and a shield against inflation. Hungary saw relative stability and growth under this monetary regime until the end of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

### Reintroduction Post World War II

The reintroduction of the Forint in 1946 was a crucial move to tackle hyperinflation that devastated the previous currency, the pengő. The move was substantial, with one Forint equating to 400 octillion pengő. This revaluation marked an era of economic stabilization and revival in post-war Hungary.

# Head of Household

## Definition
**Head of Household** is a tax [filing status](../f/filing_status.md) in the United States for individuals who are unmarried and maintain a [home](../h/home.md) for a qualifying person. This status allows for a higher [standard deduction](../s/standard_deduction.md) and potentially lower tax rates compared to filing as a single individual.

## Key Components
1. **Unmarried Status**: To qualify, the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) must be unmarried or considered unmarried on the last day of the tax year.
2. **Maintaining a [Home](../h/home.md)**: The [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) must have paid more than half the cost of keeping up a [home](../h/home.md) for the year.
3. **Qualifying Person**: The [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) must have a qualifying person living with them for more than half the year, except in cases of temporary absences like school, vacation, or medical care.

## Importance
1. **Tax Benefits**: Filing as Head of Household typically offers a higher [standard deduction](../s/standard_deduction.md) and lower tax rates compared to the single [filing status](../f/filing_status.md).
2. **Financial Support**: Reflects the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md)â€™s responsibility in supporting and maintaining a household for dependents.

## Qualifying Criteria
### Unmarried or Considered Unmarried
- **Unmarried**: Not legally married on the last day of the tax year.
- **Considered Unmarried**: Meets specific IRS criteria for being considered unmarried, even if legally married.

### Maintaining a Home
- **Financial Contribution**: The [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) must have paid more than half the cost of maintaining the household, including rent, [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [interest](../i/interest.md), utilities, property [taxes](../t/taxes.md), and groceries.

### Qualifying Person
1. **Qualifying Child**: A dependent child, stepchild, adopted child, foster child, sibling, or descendant who lived with the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) for more than half the year.
2. **[Qualifying Relative](../q/qualifying_relative.md)**: A dependent parent (not required to live with the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md)), or other relatives who meet specific IRS dependency tests and lived with the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) for more than half the year.

## Example Scenarios
1. **Single Parent**: Jane is a single mother who lives with her two children. She pays more than half the costs of maintaining the [home](../h/home.md) and her children qualify as dependents. Jane can file as Head of Household.
2. **Supporting Parent**: John is unmarried and pays for more than half of the costs to maintain a [home](../h/home.md) for his elderly mother, who qualifies as his dependent. John can file as Head of Household.
3. **Divorced Individual**: Mary is divorced and her child lives with her for more than half the year. She pays the majority of the [household expenses](../h/household_expenses.md). Mary qualifies to file as Head of Household.

## Benefits
1. **Higher [Standard Deduction](../s/standard_deduction.md)**: For the tax year 2023, the [standard deduction](../s/standard_deduction.md) for Head of Household is $20,800, compared to $13,850 for single filers.
2. **Lower Tax Rates**: Head of Household filers benefit from wider [tax brackets](../t/tax_brackets.md), which can result in a lower overall [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md).
3. **Tax Credits**: Eligibility for certain tax credits, such as the [Child Tax Credit](../c/child_tax_credit.md) and [Earned Income](../e/earned_income.md) [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md), may be higher.

## Challenges
1. **Documentation**: Ensuring proper documentation to prove that more than half the [household expenses](../h/household_expenses.md) were paid by the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) and that the qualifying person meets IRS criteria.
2. **IRS Rules**: Navigating the complex IRS rules and criteria for qualifying as Head of Household.
3. **Changing Circumstances**: Adjusting to changes in personal circumstances, such as changes in marital status or dependents, which can affect [filing status](../f/filing_status.md) eligibility.

## Conclusion
Filing as Head of Household can provide significant tax benefits for eligible individuals who support and maintain a household for qualifying dependents. Understanding the criteria and maintaining proper documentation are crucial for maximizing these benefits and ensuring compliance with IRS regulations.

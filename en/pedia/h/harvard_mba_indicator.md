# The Harvard MBA Indicator

The Harvard MBA Indicator is an unconventional economic indicator that has been used by investors to gauge the stock market's performance. Despite its informal nature, it has garnered significant interest due to its sometimes surprisingly accurate reflections of market trends. This indicator is based on the career choices of Harvard Business School (HBS) graduates, which are then analyzed to provide insights into broader economic conditions and market sentiment.

## Origin and Concept

The Harvard MBA Indicator was introduced by investment professionals who observed a correlation between the choices of HBS graduates and subsequent market performance. The logic behind the indicator is relatively simple: if a large proportion of HBS graduates choose careers in investment banking or management consulting, it suggests a high level of confidence in the financial markets and the economy. Conversely, if graduates opt for more conservative paths, such as positions in corporate management or entrepreneurship, it might indicate a lack of confidence and an impending market downturn.

The rationale is that HBS graduates, considered some of the brightest and most ambitious individuals in the business world, have access to privileged information and possess keen insights into market and economic conditions. Their career choices are thus thought to reflect their outlook on the future state of the economy and financial markets.

## Methodology

The methodology of the Harvard MBA Indicator involves tracking the career choices of the graduating class of Harvard Business School. This data is then analyzed to determine the proportion of graduates entering various sectors, primarily focusing on finance and investment banking versus other sectors.

1. **Data Collection**: The career choices of HBS graduates are gathered from surveys and published reports by Harvard Business School. This data includes information on the sectors and companies graduates enter upon completing their MBA.

2. **Analysis**: The collected data is then analyzed to determine trends and changes in career preferences over time. A higher percentage of graduates entering finance and investment banking is interpreted as a sign of market optimism, while a shift towards more conservative sectors is seen as a sign of caution among the graduates.

3. **Interpretation**: The results of the analysis are interpreted to provide insights into market sentiment and economic conditions. A high Harvard MBA Indicator suggests that the financial markets are likely to perform well, whereas a low indicator may signal an impending downturn.

## Historical Performance

While the Harvard MBA Indicator is not a scientifically rigorously tested model, it has shown some interesting correlations with market performance over the years. Notable instances include:

- **Late 1980s**: During the late 1980s, there was a significant influx of HBS graduates into investment banking and finance. This period saw a strong bull market, which eventually culminated in the stock market crash of 1987.

- **Dot-Com Bubble (Late 1990s to Early 2000s)**: The late 1990s and early 2000s saw a high percentage of HBS graduates entering the tech sector during the dot-com bubble. As the bubble burst, there was a noticeable shift towards more traditional and conservative career choices.

- **Pre-2008 Financial Crisis**: In the years leading up to the 2008 financial crisis, there was again a high percentage of HBS graduates entering finance, particularly in investment banking and hedge funds. Post-crisis, there was a notable shift towards entrepreneurship and corporate roles.

These historical patterns suggest that the Harvard MBA Indicator can provide valuable insights into market sentiment and potential turning points in the financial markets.

## Criticisms and Limitations

Despite its intriguing nature, the Harvard MBA Indicator is not without its criticisms and limitations:

1. **Non-Scientific Basis**: The indicator is not founded on rigorous scientific principles or statistical methods. It is largely based on anecdotal evidence and observed correlations, which may not always hold true.

2. **Small Sample Size**: The indicator is based on the career choices of a relatively small and highly specific group of individuals. While HBS graduates are influential, their choices may not be representative of broader market trends.

3. **Lag in Data**: The data collection process may involve a lag, as career choices are typically reported after graduates have started their jobs. This lag can reduce the timeliness and relevance of the indicator.

4. **Subjectivity in Interpretation**: The interpretation of the Harvard MBA Indicator involves a degree of subjectivity. Different analysts may draw different conclusions from the same data, leading to potential inconsistencies.

5. **Changing Dynamics**: The career preferences of HBS graduates may change over time due to various factors, such as shifts in industry trends, changes in the job market, and evolving aspirations of graduates. These dynamics can affect the reliability of the indicator.

Despite these limitations, the Harvard MBA Indicator provides an interesting perspective on market sentiment and economic conditions, making it a useful tool for investors who appreciate unconventional approaches.

## Practical Applications

Investors and analysts who use the Harvard MBA Indicator often do so in conjunction with other traditional and non-traditional indicators to form a more comprehensive view of the market. Here are some practical applications:

1. **Market Sentiment Analysis**: By tracking the career choices of HBS graduates, investors can gauge the overall sentiment in the financial markets. A high percentage of graduates entering finance can indicate optimism and a potential bull market, while a shift towards other sectors might suggest caution.

2. **Timing Market Entries and Exits**: The Harvard MBA Indicator can be used to help time market entries and exits. For example, if the indicator suggests high market optimism, it might be a signal to enter the market. Conversely, if the indicator shows a shift towards more conservative career choices, it might be a signal to exit or reduce exposure to equities.

3. **Complementing Other Indicators**: The Harvard MBA Indicator can complement other economic and financial indicators, such as GDP growth, unemployment rates, and stock market indices. By combining the Harvard MBA Indicator with other data points, investors can form a more nuanced view of market conditions.

4. **Understanding Economic Cycles**: The indicator can provide insights into economic cycles by highlighting periods of optimism and caution among top business graduates. This information can help investors anticipate potential turning points in the economy and adjust their strategies accordingly.

## Conclusion

The Harvard MBA Indicator is a fascinating, albeit unconventional, tool for gauging market sentiment and economic conditions. Based on the career choices of Harvard Business School graduates, this indicator has shown some intriguing correlations with market performance over the years. While not without its limitations and criticisms, it offers a unique perspective that can complement more traditional analytical tools.

Investors who are open to considering unconventional indicators may find value in the Harvard MBA Indicator, especially when used in conjunction with other data points. By providing insights into the career preferences and confidence levels of some of the brightest minds in business, the Harvard MBA Indicator adds an interesting dimension to the broader field of economic and market analysis.

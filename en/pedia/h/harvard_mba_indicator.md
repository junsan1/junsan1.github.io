# Harvard MBA Indicator

The Harvard MBA [Indicator](../i/indicator.md) is an unconventional [economic indicator](../e/economic_indicator.md) that has been used by investors to gauge the [stock market](../s/stock_market.md)'s performance. Despite its informal nature, it has garnered significant [interest](../i/interest.md) due to its sometimes surprisingly accurate reflections of [market](../m/market.md) trends. This [indicator](../i/indicator.md) is based on the career choices of [Harvard Business School](../h/harvard_business_school.md) (HBS) graduates, which are then analyzed to provide insights into broader [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md) and [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md).

## Origin and Concept

The Harvard MBA [Indicator](../i/indicator.md) was introduced by investment professionals who observed a [correlation](../c/correlation.md) between the choices of HBS graduates and subsequent [market](../m/market.md) performance. The logic behind the [indicator](../i/indicator.md) is relatively simple: if a large proportion of HBS graduates choose careers in [investment banking](../i/investment_banking.md) or management consulting, it suggests a high level of confidence in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and the [economy](../e/economy.md). Conversely, if graduates opt for more conservative paths, such as positions in corporate management or entrepreneurship, it might indicate a lack of confidence and an impending [market](../m/market.md) downturn.

The rationale is that HBS graduates, considered some of the brightest and most ambitious individuals in the [business](../b/business.md) world, have access to privileged information and possess keen insights into [market](../m/market.md) and [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md). Their career choices are thus thought to reflect their outlook on the future state of the [economy](../e/economy.md) and [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

## Methodology

The methodology of the Harvard MBA [Indicator](../i/indicator.md) involves tracking the career choices of the graduating class of [Harvard Business School](../h/harvard_business_school.md). This data is then analyzed to determine the proportion of graduates entering various sectors, primarily focusing on [finance](../f/finance.md) and [investment banking](../i/investment_banking.md) versus other sectors.

1. **Data Collection**: The career choices of HBS graduates are gathered from surveys and published reports by [Harvard Business School](../h/harvard_business_school.md). This data includes information on the sectors and companies graduates enter upon completing their MBA.

2. **Analysis**: The collected data is then analyzed to determine trends and changes in career preferences over time. A higher percentage of graduates entering [finance](../f/finance.md) and [investment banking](../i/investment_banking.md) is interpreted as a sign of [market](../m/market.md) optimism, while a shift towards more conservative sectors is seen as a sign of caution among the graduates.

3. **Interpretation**: The results of the analysis are interpreted to provide insights into [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) and [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md). A high Harvard MBA [Indicator](../i/indicator.md) suggests that the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) are likely to perform well, whereas a low [indicator](../i/indicator.md) may signal an impending downturn.

## Historical Performance

While the Harvard MBA [Indicator](../i/indicator.md) is not a scientifically rigorously tested model, it has shown some interesting correlations with [market](../m/market.md) performance over the years. Notable instances include:

- **Late 1980s**: During the late 1980s, there was a significant influx of HBS graduates into [investment banking](../i/investment_banking.md) and [finance](../f/finance.md). This period saw a strong [bull market](../b/bull_market.md), which eventually culminated in the [stock market crash](../s/stock_market_crash.md) of 1987.

- **Dot-Com Bubble (Late 1990s to Early 2000s)**: The late 1990s and early 2000s saw a high percentage of HBS graduates entering the tech sector during the dot-com bubble. As the bubble burst, there was a noticeable shift towards more traditional and conservative career choices.

- **Pre-2008 [Financial Crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md)**: In the years leading up to the 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md), there was again a high percentage of HBS graduates entering [finance](../f/finance.md), particularly in [investment banking](../i/investment_banking.md) and [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds. Post-crisis, there was a notable shift towards entrepreneurship and corporate roles.

These historical patterns suggest that the Harvard MBA [Indicator](../i/indicator.md) can provide valuable insights into [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) and potential turning points in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

## Criticisms and Limitations

Despite its intriguing nature, the Harvard MBA [Indicator](../i/indicator.md) is not without its criticisms and limitations:

1. **Non-Scientific [Basis](../b/basis.md)**: The [indicator](../i/indicator.md) is not founded on rigorous scientific principles or statistical methods. It is largely based on anecdotal evidence and observed correlations, which may not always [hold](../h/hold.md) true.

2. **Small Sample Size**: The [indicator](../i/indicator.md) is based on the career choices of a relatively small and highly specific group of individuals. While HBS graduates are influential, their choices may not be representative of broader [market](../m/market.md) trends.

3. **Lag in Data**: The data collection process may involve a lag, as career choices are typically reported after graduates have started their jobs. This lag can reduce the timeliness and relevance of the [indicator](../i/indicator.md).

4. **Subjectivity in Interpretation**: The interpretation of the Harvard MBA [Indicator](../i/indicator.md) involves a degree of subjectivity. Different analysts may draw different conclusions from the same data, leading to potential inconsistencies.

5. **Changing Dynamics**: The career preferences of HBS graduates may change over time due to various factors, such as shifts in [industry](../i/industry.md) trends, changes in the [job market](../j/job_market.md), and evolving aspirations of graduates. These dynamics can affect the reliability of the [indicator](../i/indicator.md).

Despite these limitations, the Harvard MBA [Indicator](../i/indicator.md) provides an interesting perspective on [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) and [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md), making it a useful tool for investors who appreciate unconventional approaches.

## Practical Applications

Investors and analysts who use the Harvard MBA [Indicator](../i/indicator.md) often do so in conjunction with other traditional and non-traditional indicators to form a more comprehensive view of the [market](../m/market.md). Here are some practical applications:

1. **[Market Sentiment Analysis](../m/market_sentiment_analysis.md)**: By tracking the career choices of HBS graduates, investors can gauge the overall sentiment in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). A high percentage of graduates entering [finance](../f/finance.md) can indicate optimism and a potential [bull market](../b/bull_market.md), while a shift towards other sectors might suggest caution.

2. **Timing [Market](../m/market.md) Entries and Exits**: The Harvard MBA [Indicator](../i/indicator.md) can be used to help time [market](../m/market.md) entries and exits. For example, if the [indicator](../i/indicator.md) suggests high [market](../m/market.md) optimism, it might be a signal to enter the [market](../m/market.md). Conversely, if the [indicator](../i/indicator.md) shows a shift towards more conservative career choices, it might be a signal to exit or reduce exposure to equities.

3. **Complementing Other Indicators**: The Harvard MBA [Indicator](../i/indicator.md) can [complement](../c/complement.md) other economic and financial indicators, such as GDP growth, [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md) rates, and [stock market](../s/stock_market.md) indices. By combining the Harvard MBA [Indicator](../i/indicator.md) with other data points, investors can form a more nuanced view of [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

4. **Understanding [Economic Cycles](../e/economic_cycles.md)**: The [indicator](../i/indicator.md) can provide insights into [economic cycles](../e/economic_cycles.md) by highlighting periods of optimism and caution among top [business](../b/business.md) graduates. This information can help investors anticipate potential turning points in the [economy](../e/economy.md) and adjust their strategies accordingly.

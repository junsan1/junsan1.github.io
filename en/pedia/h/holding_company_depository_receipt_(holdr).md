# Holding Company Depository Receipt (HOLDR)

A [Holding Company](../h/holding_company.md) [Depository](../d/depository.md) Receipt (HOLDR) was a type of [security](../s/security.md) that allowed investors to purchase and [trade](../t/trade.md) a single instrument, which represented a bundle of various [stocks](../s/stock.md) in a specific sector or [industry](../i/industry.md). This type of [security](../s/security.md) aimed to provide investors with a simplified method for exposure to [industry](../i/industry.md)-specific portfolios without the need to buy each individual stock. HOLDRs were created by [Merrill Lynch](../m/merrill_lynch.md) and were introduced to the [market](../m/market.md) in the late 1990s. Although they were innovative at the time, their popularity has waned in recent years due to the rise of other investment vehicles like [Exchange](../e/exchange.md)-Traded Funds (ETFs).

## Structure and Mechanism

HOLDRs functioned somewhat similarly to ETFs, but there were distinct differences. They were essentially a fixed basket of [stocks](../s/stock.md) that did not change over time unless subjected to corporate actions such as mergers or acquisitions. Here’s a closer look at their structure and mechanism:

### Ownership and Custody

HOLDRs were created when an [investor](../i/investor.md) deposited [shares](../s/shares.md) of [multiple](../m/multiple.md) companies within a specific sector into a [trust](../t/trust.md), which then issued [depository](../d/depository.md) [receipts](../r/receipt.md) representing ownership of these [shares](../s/shares.md). These [depository](../d/depository.md) [receipts](../r/receipt.md) could be traded on the stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md) like regular [shares](../s/shares.md).

### Fixed Composition

Unlike ETFs, HOLDRs had a fixed composition. The [stocks](../s/stock.md) in the basket remained constant unless a corporate action forced a change. This meant investors did not experience the same level of [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md) that might occur with an ETF.

### Voting Rights

Investors holding HOLDRs had the right to vote on the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md)’ corporate matters, just as if they held the individual [shares](../s/shares.md) directly. This feature set HOLDRs apart from many ETFs, where investors often do not have such voting rights.

### Dividends

The dividends paid by the [stocks](../s/stock.md) within the HOLDRs were passed directly to the holders of the HOLDRs. Investors received these dividends in the same proportion as if they held the individual [stocks](../s/stock.md).

## Comparison to ETFs

While both HOLDRs and ETFs allowed for diversified exposure to [industry](../i/industry.md) sectors, there were significant differences:

### Flexibility

ETFs typically have a dynamic composition that can be periodically rebalanced to reflect changes in the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md) or [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md). In contrast, the stock composition in HOLDRs was static, [offering](../o/offering.md) less flexibility in terms of adaptation to [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

### Diversity

ETFs offered a wider [range](../r/range.md) of investment strategies, including both passive [indexing](../i/indexing.md) and actively managed [options](../o/options.md). HOLDRs, on the other hand, were more narrowly focused on specific sectors and did not provide the same level of diversity in [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md).

### Tax Efficiency

ETFs are generally considered more tax-efficient due to their unique creation and [redemption](../r/redemption.md) process, which can reduce [capital](../c/capital.md) gains [taxes](../t/taxes.md). HOLDRs did not [offer](../o/offer.md) the same level of tax [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md), making them less attractive from a tax perspective.

## Popularity and Decline

HOLDRs enjoyed a period of popularity, particularly during the late 1990s and early 2000s, as investors sought easier ways to [gain](../g/gain.md) exposure to specific sectors. However, their popularity declined as ETFs became more prevalent and offered greater flexibility and tax advantages.

### Technological Advancements

The rise of [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) and other technological advancements in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) further contributed to the decline of HOLDRs. ETFs benefited from these advancements due to their greater appeal in terms of [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) and flexibility.

### Regulatory Changes

Regulatory changes and evolving [investor](../i/investor.md) preferences also played a role in the decline of HOLDRs. The increased scrutiny on financial instruments and the shift towards more transparent and efficient investment vehicles made ETFs the preferred choice for many investors.

### Lasting Impact

Despite their decline, HOLDRs were an important innovation in the world of investment products. They provided a stepping stone for the development of more sophisticated investment tools like ETFs, which continue to dominate the [market](../m/market.md).

## Examples of HOLDRs

Several [industry](../i/industry.md)-specific HOLDRs were created, targeting various sectors and industries:

### Internet HOLDRs (HHH)

This HOLDR consisted of a basket of internet-related [stocks](../s/stock.md) during the dot-com boom. Companies in the basket included major players like Yahoo! and Amazon. The composition of the Internet HOLDRs reflected the rapid growth and [volatility](../v/volatility.md) of the internet sector during that time.

### Biotech HOLDRs (BBH)

Biotech HOLDRs focused on the biotechnology sector, providing exposure to companies involved in biotech research and development. It included [stocks](../s/stock.md) of major biotech firms like Amgen and Genentech.

### Semiconductor HOLDRs (SMH)

This HOLDR provided exposure to the semiconductor [industry](../i/industry.md), including prominent companies like Intel and Texas Instruments. It was designed for investors looking to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on the growth of the semiconductor [market](../m/market.md).

### Regional Bank HOLDRs (RKH)

The Regional [Bank](../b/bank.md) HOLDR comprised [stocks](../s/stock.md) of regional banks across the United States, [offering](../o/offering.md) exposure to the banking sector. Banks like BB&T and SunTrust were part of this basket.

## Conclusion

[Holding Company](../h/holding_company.md) [Depository](../d/depository.md) [Receipts](../r/receipt.md) (HOLDRs) were a unique financial innovation that allowed investors to [gain](../g/gain.md) sector-specific exposure through a single [security](../s/security.md). Although they provided a useful investment tool during their time, their fixed composition and lack of flexibility eventually led to their decline in favor of more dynamic and efficient investment vehicles like ETFs. Despite their reduced presence in today's [market](../m/market.md), HOLDRs played a significant role in the evolution of investment products and paved the way for more advanced instruments.

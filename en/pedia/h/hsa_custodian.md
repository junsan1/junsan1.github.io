# HSA Custodian

An HSA (Health Savings Account) custodian is a financial institution that manages and administers HSAs on behalf of account holders. HSAs are tax-advantaged savings accounts designed to help individuals save for and pay for qualified medical expenses. HSAs are available to individuals enrolled in high-deductible health plans (HDHPs). The role of the custodian includes handling the deposits, distributions, and investments associated with these accounts while ensuring compliance with relevant regulations.

## Key Functions of an HSA Custodian

### Account Administration
HSA custodians are responsible for the overall administration of the accounts. This includes setting up new accounts, managing account details, and ensuring that account holders' information is accurately recorded and maintained. The custodian also oversees contributions to and withdrawals from the account, ensuring that these transactions comply with IRS regulations.

### Investment Management
In addition to holding cash balances, HSA custodians often provide account holders with the option to invest their funds in various financial instruments, such as mutual funds, stocks, and bonds. The custodian manages these investment options and provides account holders with tools and resources to make informed investment decisions. The goal is to help account holders grow their HSA funds over time to better cover future medical expenses.

### Tax Reporting
HSA custodians are responsible for providing account holders with the necessary tax forms and documentation. This includes form 5498-SA, which details contributions made to the HSA, and form 1099-SA, which reports distributions taken from the account. These forms are essential for account holders to accurately report their HSA activity on their tax returns.

### Compliance with Legal and Regulatory Requirements
HSA custodians must ensure that their operations comply with all relevant laws and regulations, including those set forth by the IRS. This includes adhering to contribution limits, ensuring that funds are used for qualified medical expenses, and providing accurate reporting. Custodians must also stay current with any changes in legislation that affect HSAs.

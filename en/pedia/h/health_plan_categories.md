## Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) Plans

**Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs)** are a popular type of [health insurance](../h/health_insurance.md) plan that provides a wide [range](../r/range.md) of healthcare services through a network of doctors and hospitals. Here are the key features of HMO plans:

- **Referrals Required**: To see a specialist or get certain medical services, you typically need a referral from your PCP.
- **Lower Premiums**: HMOs generally have lower premiums compared to other types of health plans.
- **Limited Out-of-Network Coverage**: HMO plans usually do not cover out-of-network care, except in emergencies.

### Benefits

- **Cost Savings**: Lower premiums and out-of-pocket costs make HMOs an affordable option.
- **Coordinated Care**: The requirement to have a PCP helps ensure that care is well-coordinated and comprehensive.

### Drawbacks

- **Limited Flexibility**: The need for referrals and the limited network can be restrictive.
- **Out-of-Network Restrictions**: Lack of out-of-network coverage can be problematic if you need specialized care not available within the network.

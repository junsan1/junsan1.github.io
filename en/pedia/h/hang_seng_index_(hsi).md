# Hang Seng Index (HSI)

The Hang Seng [Index](../i/index.md) (HSI) is a freefloat-adjusted [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md)-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) stock [market index](../m/market_index.md) in Hong Kong. It is the primary [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of the overall [market](../m/market.md) performance in the Hong Kong Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (HKEX). The HSI covers the largest and most [liquid](../l/liquid.md) companies [listed](../l/listed.md) in Hong Kong, representing the performance of these industries: [Commerce](../c/commerce.md) and [Industry](../i/industry.md), [Finance](../f/finance.md), Utilities, and Properties.

## Historical Background
The Hang Seng [Index](../i/index.md) was launched by the Hang Seng [Bank](../b/bank.md) on November 24, 1969, in [order](../o/order.md) to provide a yardstick of the Hong Kong [stock market](../s/stock_market.md)'s performance. The base [value](../v/value.md) of the [index](../i/index.md) was set at 100 points on July 31, 1964. Since its inception, the [index](../i/index.md) has been adjusted periodically to include additional [stocks](../s/stock.md) or to adjust for stock splits and consolidations.

## Calculation Methodology
The HSI employs a freefloat-adjusted [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) weighting strategy. This means it takes into account only the [shares](../s/shares.md) readily available in the [market](../m/market.md) (free [float](../f/float.md)), ignoring those held by corporate insiders. The calculation formula can be outlined as follows:

**HSI = (Sum of Adjusted [Market](../m/market.md) Cap of Constituent [Stocks](../s/stock.md) / Base [Market Capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md)) x Base [Index](../i/index.md) [Value](../v/value.md)**

Where:
- Adjusted [Market](../m/market.md) Cap is computed by multiplying the Share Price by the Freefloat-Adjusted Number of [Shares](../s/shares.md).
- The Base [Market Capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) and Base [Index](../i/index.md) [Value](../v/value.md) are constants that were set when the [index](../i/index.md) was launched.

## Constituents and Weighting
As of the latest revision, the Hang Seng [Index](../i/index.md) comprises 66 constituent companies, reflecting around 58% of the total [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) on the Hong Kong Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md). The constituents are selected based on 
- [Market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md),
- Sector representation,
- [Turnover](../t/turnover.md),
- Financial soundness,
- And the company's contribution to the Hong Kong [economy](../e/economy.md).

The HSI adopts a capping methodology where the weight of a single constituent is limited to 10% to avoid [market](../m/market.md) distortion.

## Sectoral Representation
The HSI categorizes its constituents into four primary sectors:
1. **[Commerce](../c/commerce.md) and [Industry](../i/industry.md)**: This is the largest segment, covering retail, telecommunications, energy, and more.
2. **[Finance](../f/finance.md)**: Includes banks, [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies, brokerage firms, and related financial services companies.
3. **Utilities**: Constitutes companies generating and providing electricity, gas, and water services.
4. **Properties**: Includes [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) developers and investment trusts.

## Performance and Significance
The HSI is regarded as the heartbeat of the Hong Kong [stock market](../s/stock_market.md) and a barometer of the economic health of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. [Hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds, mutual funds, and individual investors all closely follow the [index](../i/index.md). Its performance can be impacted by local economic data, regional and global [market](../m/market.md) trends, regulatory changes, and geopolitical events.

## Trading and Derivatives
Various financial products derive their [value](../v/value.md) from the HSI. These include:
- **[Index Futures](../i/index_futures.md)**: Allow traders to bet on the future movement of the HSI.
- **[Index Options](../i/index_options.md)**: Provide the option, but not the obligation, to [trade](../t/trade.md) the HSI at a predetermined price.
- **[Exchange](../e/exchange.md)-Traded Funds (ETFs)**: Act as investment funds tracking the HSI's performance.
- **Contracts for Difference (CFDs)**: Allow speculative trading on the price movement without ownership of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

The Hong Kong Exchanges and [Clearing](../c/clearing.md) Limited (HKEX) facilitates the trading of these products. More information can be found on their official website: [HKEX](https://www.hkex.com.hk).

## Key Milestones
- **1997 [Asian Financial Crisis](../a/asian_financial_crisis.md)**: The HSI suffered significant losses but also rebounded and grew significantly in the following decade.
- **2003 SARS Epidemic**: Resulted in a sharp decline but led to subsequent strong growth as Hong Kong's [economy](../e/economy.md) recovered.
- **2019 Protests and COVID-19 Pandemic**: Both events tested the resilience of the HSI with considerable fluctuations in [market](../m/market.md) performance.

## Conclusion
The Hang Seng [Index](../i/index.md) serves as a vital [indicator](../i/indicator.md) and financial tool representing the Hong Kong [stock market](../s/stock_market.md). Its highly diversified and freefloat-adjusted nature provides a comprehensive snapshot of [market](../m/market.md) trends, making it indispensable for both local and international investors. Given its historical significance and role in the financial landscape, the HSI [will](../w/will.md) likely continue to be a focal point for [market](../m/market.md) analysis and [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

# HUD-1 Form

The HUD-1 Form, also known as the Closing [Disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) Form, is a pivotal document in the [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) settlement process in the United States. This comprehensive document details all the financial transactions between the buyer, seller, and [lender](../l/lender.md) during the [sale](../s/sale.md) or refinancing of [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) property. The form is mandated by the [Real Estate](../r/real_estate.md) Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) and is managed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Understanding the HUD-1 form is crucial for anyone involved in [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) transactions, as it provides a clear breakdown of all costs and ensures [transparency](../t/transparency.md) in the closing process.

## Overview of the HUD-1 Form

## Use of the HUD-1 Form

[Real estate](../r/real_estate.md) professionals, buyers, and sellers use the HUD-1 form during the final stages of a [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) [transaction](../t/transaction.md). It ensures that all parties are aware of the exact financial breakdown, promoting [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and avoiding any surprises at closing. The form must be reviewed by all parties, and any discrepancies should be addressed before finalizing the [transaction](../t/transaction.md).

## Recent Changes and Regulations

In 2015, the HUD-1 form was replaced by the Closing [Disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) form for most residential [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) transactions due to the implementation of the TILA-RESPA Integrated [Disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) (TRID) rule by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). However, the HUD-1 form is still used for reverse mortgages and certain other types of [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) transactions. The TRID rule aims to simplify paperwork, making it easier for consumers to understand their [loan](../l/loan.md) terms and associated costs.

## Purpose of Home Inspection

### Key Objectives:

1. **Assessing Structural Integrity:** To [check](../c/check.md) the overall structural health of the building, including foundations, walls, floors, and roof.
2. **Identifying Safety Issues:** To uncover any hazards that could pose a [risk](../r/risk.md) to the residents, such as faulty wiring or plumbing.
3. **Evaluating System Conditions:** To review the functioning status of major systems like HVAC, electrical, and plumbing.

## Home Inspection Process

The [home](../h/home.md) inspection process follows a systematic approach to ensure a thorough evaluation.

### Pre-Inspection Agreement

This is a document signed by both the inspector and the homebuyer outlining the [scope](../s/scope.md) of the inspection. It ensures both parties understand what [will](../w/will.md) be inspected and any limitations.

### Inspection Day

The actual inspection typically takes 2-4 hours, depending on the size of the [home](../h/home.md). The inspector examines all the critical components [listed](../l/listed.md) above and notes any issues or concerns.

### Post-Inspection Report

After the inspection, the inspector provides a detailed report. This document outlines all findings, including photographs and descriptions of any issues discovered. The report also provides recommendations for repairs or further evaluation by specialists.

### Follow-Up Actions

Based on the report, the buyer can take several actions:

- **Request Repairs:** Asking the seller to address specific issues before closing.
- **Renegotiate Price:** Using the findings to negotiate a lower price.
- **Proceed as Planned:** If no significant issues are found, proceed with the purchase.

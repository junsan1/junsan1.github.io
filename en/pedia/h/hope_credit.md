# Hope Credit

Hope [Credit](../c/credit.md) refers to the Hope Scholarship [Credit](../c/credit.md), a type of [tax credit](../t/tax_credit.md) available to American taxpayers who are paying for higher education costs. This [credit](../c/credit.md) is aimed at helping [offset](../o/offset.md) the costs of post-secondary education by providing financial relief through the tax system.

## Overview of the Hope Credit

The Hope Scholarship [Credit](../c/credit.md), often simply called "Hope [Credit](../c/credit.md)," is available to eligible students enrolled in eligible educational institutions, typically colleges or universities. It was created as part of the [Taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) Relief Act of 1997, and for many years, it provided valuable financial assistance to students and their families.

This [credit](../c/credit.md) has since been largely replaced by the American Opportunity [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md) (AOTC), which offers more benefits and covers additional educational costs. However, understanding the Hope [Credit](../c/credit.md) is essential as it lays the foundation for many of the provisions found in the AOTC.

## Eligibility Requirements

To qualify for the Hope [Credit](../c/credit.md), several specific conditions had to be met:

1. **Enrollment Status**: The student must be enrolled at least half-time in a program leading to a degree, certificate, or recognized educational credential.
2. **Academic Level**: The [credit](../c/credit.md) is only available during the first two years of post-secondary education.
3. **[Taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) Requirements**: The [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) claiming the [credit](../c/credit.md) must have a modified adjusted [gross income](../g/gross_income.md) (MAGI) below a particular threshold, which varies by year and [filing status](../f/filing_status.md).
4. **Qualified Expenses**: Only certain types of educational expenses qualify for the Hope [Credit](../c/credit.md). These generally include tuition and fees but exclude costs such as room and board.
5. **Non-Felony Status**: The student must not have had a felony drug conviction at the end of the tax year.

## Financial Details

The Hope [Credit](../c/credit.md) allows taxpayers to claim a [credit](../c/credit.md) of up to $1,800 per eligible student. This [credit](../c/credit.md) is calculated by taking 100% of the first $1,200 in qualified education expenses and 50% of the next $1,200 for each eligible student.

## Phase-Out Ranges

The amount of the Hope [Credit](../c/credit.md) is gradually reduced (phased out) for taxpayers with incomes above specific thresholds. These thresholds are adjusted annually for [inflation](../i/inflation.md) and differ based on [filing status](../f/filing_status.md) (e.g., single, [married filing jointly](../m/married_filing_jointly.md)).

For example, the phase-out [range](../r/range.md) for married couples filing jointly might start at $80,000 of MAGI and be fully phased out at $100,000. For single filers, the phase-out [range](../r/range.md) might be lower.

## Claiming the Hope Credit

To claim the Hope [Credit](../c/credit.md), taxpayers must use IRS Form 8863, "Education Credits (American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning Credits)." This form allows taxpayers to calculate the amount of the [credit](../c/credit.md) and report it on their [tax return](../t/tax_return.md). 

## Transition to the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC)

In 2009, the American Opportunity [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md) (AOTC) was introduced, which expanded upon the benefits provided by the Hope [Credit](../c/credit.md). The AOTC increased the maximum [credit](../c/credit.md) amount to $2,500 and allowed it to be claimed for four years of post-secondary education rather than just two. Furthermore, up to 40% of the AOTC is refundable, which means that taxpayers can receive a refund even if they owe no tax.

The AOTC includes many provisions of the Hope [Credit](../c/credit.md) and offers even more substantial benefits. However, it maintained the anti-[fraud](../f/fraud.md) provisions and added additional criteria for eligibility, essentially building upon the framework of the original Hope [Credit](../c/credit.md).

## Comparison with Lifetime Learning Credit

In addition to the Hope [Credit](../c/credit.md) and AOTC, the [Lifetime Learning Credit](../l/lifetime_learning_credit.md) is another [tax credit](../t/tax_credit.md) aimed at helping students [offset](../o/offset.md) the costs of higher education. While the Hope [Credit](../c/credit.md) and AOTC are more focused on undergraduate students, the [Lifetime Learning Credit](../l/lifetime_learning_credit.md) is available for all years of post-secondary education, including graduate and professional degree courses.

Key differences include:
- **Amount**: The [Lifetime Learning Credit](../l/lifetime_learning_credit.md) provides up to $2,000 per [tax return](../t/tax_return.md), not per student.
- **Years of Schooling**: It can be used for an unlimited number of years, unlike the AOTC, which is limited to four years.
- **Phase-Out**: [Income](../i/income.md) phase-out ranges for the [Lifetime Learning Credit](../l/lifetime_learning_credit.md) differ from those of the AOTC.

## Impact on Higher Education

The introduction of the Hope [Credit](../c/credit.md), and its successor the AOTC, had a significant impact on higher education funding. These credits provide crucial financial relief to families, potentially making higher education more accessible. However, their long-term impact on college enrollment rates and educational outcomes has been the subject of various studies, which suggest that while they provide financial help, additional measures may be needed to address systemic issues in education affordability.

## Conclusion

The Hope [Credit](../c/credit.md) was a valuable tool for students and their families to help manage the rising costs of post-secondary education. Though it has been largely supplanted by the AOTC, the principles and structure of the Hope [Credit](../c/credit.md) laid the groundwork for current education tax benefits. Understanding its framework helps in comprehending the broader landscape of educational tax credits available to American taxpayers today.

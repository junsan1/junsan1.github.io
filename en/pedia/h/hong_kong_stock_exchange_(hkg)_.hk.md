# Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKG) .HK

The Hong Kong Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (HKEX), located in Hong Kong, is one of the largest [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) globally and an essential gateway between mainland China and international [capital](../c/capital.md). With its modern [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md), efficient regulatory framework, and strategic geographic location, HKEX plays a crucial role in the global trading ecosystem.

## History and Background

The origins of the Hong Kong Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) can be traced back to the late 19th century. The [exchange](../e/exchange.md) itself was established in 1891, but its historical roots go back even further, to informal stock trading activities among merchants. Since then, HKEX has undergone significant transformation, merging with other exchanges, adopting state-of-the-art technologies, and continually evolving its regulatory structure to meet the demands of a dynamic global financial environment.

After numerous mergers and reforms, the current iteration of HKEX was established in 2000, forming a unified stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md) for Hong Kong. The HKEX Group also encompasses other entities, including the Hong Kong [Futures](../f/futures.md) [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) and the London Metal [Exchange](../e/exchange.md), broadening its influence beyond just stock trading.

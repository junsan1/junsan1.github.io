# Hacktivism

Hacktivism is a portmanteau of "hack" and "activism" and refers to the use of computer-based techniques and technologies to promote political ends or to exert social change. This term encompasses a wide [range](../r/range.md) of activities that involve hacking for a cause. The causes can [range](../r/range.md) from promoting human rights and fighting censorship to exposing governmental and corporate misconduct. Hacktivists aim to make a political statement, featuring elements of civil disobedience or protest, through the targeted use of cyber tools and technologies.

## History of Hacktivism

The origin of hacktivism traces back to the early days of the internet and hacking communities. The term itself emerged in the 1990s, but the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) principles were evident in earlier movements and cultures that pushed for [open](../o/open.md) access to information and [transparency](../t/transparency.md). The roots can be found in the hacker culture of the 1980s, prominently in the milieu of groups like Cult of the Dead Cow or individuals like Richard Stallman. These early hackers advocated for free software, [open](../o/open.md)-source programming, and unrestricted access to information as a counter to proprietary software and monopolistic practices.

### 1980s and Early Movements

Much of the early hacktivism was characterized by the formation of hacker collectives and their campaigns directed at influencing public policies and corporate practices. One influential example is the Cult of the Dead Cow (cDc), a hacker group established in 1984. They raised awareness around issues of consumer rights, privacy, and the ethical use of hacking tools. Their noteworthy release of "Back Orifice", a software capable of remotely controlling a Microsoft Windows-based computer, was aimed at exposing the vulnerabilities of the proprietary operating system and advocating for increased [security](../s/security.md) and privacy measures.

### 1990s: Emergence of Hacktivism

As the internet began to play a more central role in society in the 1990s, hacktivist activities evolved and expanded. The term "hacktivism" was coined in 1996 by the Cult of the Dead Cow member [Omega](../o/omega.md). During this period, hacktivism saw campaigns such as the Electronic Disturbance Theater (EDT) deploying virtual sit-ins and flood net techniques to protest against institutions like the Mexican government, in support of the Zapatista movement in Chiapas. 

Another prominent collective that emerged in this decade was Hacktivismo, a [spin-off](../s/spinoff.md) of cDc that focused on promoting human rights and free speech through technology. Hacktivismo developed tools aimed at circumventing government censorship and enabling dissidents to express their views freely online.

## Types of Hacktivist Activities

Hacktivism encompasses a variety of techniques that are often chosen to maximize the impact of the message or to disrupt the operations of the target. Some common forms of hacktivist activities include:

### Website Defacement

Website defacement involves altering the content of a website, usually to display a message or manifesto from the hacktivists. This type of hacktivism is highly visible and often aims to embarrass the target and draw public attention to the hacktivist's cause. A notable instance of website defacement occurred in 1996, when the homepage of the U.S. Department of Justice was altered by an individual or group calling themselves "Prankster" to display a message against the Communications Decency Act.

### Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks

DDoS attacks occur when a target server is overwhelmed with traffic from [multiple](../m/multiple.md) sources, rendering the website or online service unavailable to its intended users. Hacktivists use DDoS attacks as a form of protest or to disrupt the operations of organizations they oppose. Groups like Anonymous have frequently employed DDoS attacks as a tool of digital disruption.

### Doxing

Doxing involves the gathering and public dissemination of private information about individuals or organizations. This tactic is often used to expose corruption, misconduct, or other activities that hacktivists believe should be brought to public attention. For example, the hacktivist collective Anonymous has released personal information about members of the Ku Klux Klan as part of its #OpKKK initiative.

### Data Breaches and Leaks

Hacktivists may infiltrate the servers or databases of an organization to access sensitive or confidential information, which they then release publicly. This method is often employed to expose wrongdoing, corporate malfeasance, or governmental surveillance. One prominent example is the 2010 leak of diplomatic cables and other classified materials by WikiLeaks, which included evidence of government corruption and war crimes.

### Information Distribution and Mirror Sites

Hacktivists often create mirror sites to distribute information or content that has been censored or restricted by governments and corporations. By mirroring websites containing banned information, they're able to bypass censorship and provide access to critical information. The collective Anonymous has frequently engaged in this type of activity, creating mirrors for sites banned by repressive regimes.

### Virtual Sit-ins

Virtual sit-ins are online protests where participants use their computers to access a target website simultaneously, attempting to overwhelm it in a manner similar to a DDoS attack but with individual volunteers. While not always effective against well-defended sites, this tactic is symbolic and aims to draw attention to the hacktivists' cause.

## Prominent Hacktivist Groups and Individuals

### Anonymous

One of the most well-known hacktivist groups is Anonymous, a decentralized collective that emerged from the online message board 4chan in the early 2000s. Anonymous is known for its distinctive Guy Fawkes masks and its involvement in numerous high-profile operations, such as Operation Payback, which targeted entities opposed to WikiLeaks, and Operation Tunisia, supporting the Tunisian revolution. The lack of formal structure makes Anonymous an amorphous entity whose activities reflect the diverse motivations of its members.

### LulzSec

LulzSec (Lulz [Security](../s/security.md)) was a hacktivist group that gained notoriety in 2011 for its hacking activities, targeting high-profile organizations such as Sony, Fox, PBS, and the U.S. Senate. LulzSec's operations often combined elements of hacktivism with a sense of playfulness or "lulz" (amusement), emphasizing the vulnerabilities of their targets. Despite its short lifespan, LulzSec left a lasting impact on public awareness of cybersecurity issues. 

### WikiLeaks

WikiLeaks, founded by Julian Assange in 2006, operates on principles aligned with hacktivism, focusing on [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and the release of classified information to the public. WikiLeaks has played a significant role in releasing documents that expose governmental and corporate misconduct. Among its most notable releases are the Afghan and Iraq war logs, U.S. diplomatic cables, and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails. Julian Assange's involvement and the impact of WikiLeaks have sparked global debates on issues of freedom of information and [whistleblower](../w/whistleblower.md) protection. More information can be found at [WikiLeaks' official website](https://wikileaks.org).

### Cult of the Dead Cow (cDc)

Cult of the Dead Cow is one of the oldest and most influential hacking groups, known for its advocacy of privacy and freedom of information. The group coined the term "hacktivism" and has historically been active in exposing software vulnerabilities and promoting internet freedom. They were instrumental in the creation of "Back Orifice," a tool that highlighted Microsoft's [security](../s/security.md) flaws. The cDc continues to be a voice for digital rights and ethical hacking. More information can be found at their [official website](https://www.cultdeadcow.com).

### The Syrian Electronic Army (SEA)

The Syrian Electronic Army is a pro-government hacktivist group that emerged during the Syrian Civil War. It has been responsible for defacing websites, launching DDoS attacks, and spreading pro-Assad propaganda. The SEA targets media organizations and political figures perceived to be opposed to the Assad regime, aiming to send a political message in support of the Syrian government. They have successfully hacked into major news outlets, including The Associated Press and Al Jazeera.

## Ethical and Legal Implications

Hacktivism occupies a contentious space in discussions about ethics and legality. While supporters argue that it's a form of protest and civil disobedience, opponents see it as illicit and potentially harmful activity.

### Ethical Debates

Ethically, hacktivism raises questions about the extent to which disruptive activities can be justified by the pursuit of social or political change. Many hacktivists draw parallels to traditional forms of protest, arguing that digital disruption is a modern extension of sitting in, demonstrating, or whistleblowing. However, critics contend that such activities can lead to [collateral](../c/collateral.md) damage, such as harming innocent individuals who rely on disrupted services or violating the privacy of targeted individuals.

### Legal Issues

Legally, hacktivism often falls foul of national and international laws. Many activities classified as hacktivism, such as DDoS attacks, unauthorized access to computer systems, and data breaches, are illegal under laws like the Computer [Fraud](../f/fraud.md) and Abuse Act (CFAA) in the United States. Consequently, hacktivists [risk](../r/risk.md) severe penalties, including imprisonment, if caught and prosecuted. The tension between hacking laws and the freedom of expression is a significant area of debate, with many calling for reforms that better distinguish between malicious cybercrime and ethically motivated hacktivism.

## Conclusion

Hacktivism represents a significant and evolving facet of both hacking culture and sociopolitical activism. As digital platforms continue to become more integral to modern communication and organization, the tactics and impact of hacktivism are likely to grow. This form of activism challenges traditional ideas about protest and civil disobedience, leveraging the power of technology to advocate for [transparency](../t/transparency.md), freedom of information, and [social justice](../s/social_justice.md). However, the ethical and legal complexities it entails ensure that hacktivism remains a controversial and fiercely debated topic.

# Hard Inquiry
A hard inquiry, also known as a hard pull or hard [credit](../c/credit.md) [check](../c/check.md), is a [credit report](../c/credit_report.md) [check](../c/check.md) that occurs when a prospective [lender](../l/lender.md) reviews a consumer's [credit report](../c/credit_report.md) to make a lending decision. Unlike soft inquiries, which may occur without a potential borrower’s explicit permission and do not affect their [credit score](../c/credit_score.md), hard inquiries have a direct impact on the [credit score](../c/credit_score.md) of the individual. When a consumer applies for new [credit](../c/credit.md), such as a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md), [credit card](../c/credit_card.md), or auto [loan](../l/loan.md), the [lender](../l/lender.md) [will](../w/will.md) perform a hard inquiry to evaluate the consumer's [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md). This evaluation helps the [lender](../l/lender.md) determine whether to approve the [loan](../l/loan.md) application and the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) to [offer](../o/offer.md).

## How Hard Inquiries Work
When a potential borrower gives a [lender](../l/lender.md) permission to [check](../c/check.md) their [credit report](../c/credit_report.md), the [lender](../l/lender.md) submits a request to one or more of the major [credit](../c/credit.md) reporting agencies: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. The agency then provides the [lender](../l/lender.md) with a detailed [credit report](../c/credit_report.md) that includes the borrower's [credit](../c/credit.md) history and [credit score](../c/credit_score.md). This type of inquiry is known as a hard inquiry because it requires explicit consent and is triggered by a [credit](../c/credit.md) application.

### Hard Inquiries and Credit Score
Hard inquiries can cause a slight drop in a borrower's [credit score](../c/credit_score.md). One hard inquiry might reduce the score by a few points, but [multiple](../m/multiple.md) hard inquiries in a short period can have a [compounding](../c/compounding.md) effect. This decrease occurs because the inquiry suggests that the borrower is seeking new [credit](../c/credit.md), which increases the potential [risk](../r/risk.md) involved. However, [credit](../c/credit.md) scoring models such as FICO and [VantageScore](../v/vantagescore.md) typically account for rate shopping, for example, when applying for auto loans or mortgages. If [multiple](../m/multiple.md) inquiries for the same type of [loan](../l/loan.md) occur within a short time frame (typically 14 to 45 days), they are often treated as a single inquiry to mitigate the impact on the [credit score](../c/credit_score.md).

## Impact on Different Scoring Models
Different [credit](../c/credit.md) scoring models [handle](../h/handle.md) hard inquiries in distinct ways, and the impact can vary. For instance:

- **[FICO Score](../f/fico_score.md)**: FICO scores, widely used by lenders, typically treat hard inquiries differently based on the type of [credit](../c/credit.md) application. [Multiple](../m/multiple.md) inquiries for auto loans or mortgages within a 14-45 day window count as one single inquiry. The exact impact on the [FICO score](../f/fico_score.md) depends on the overall [credit](../c/credit.md) profile.
- **[VantageScore](../v/vantagescore.md)**: [VantageScore](../v/vantagescore.md), another major [credit](../c/credit.md) scoring model, also considers the context of hard inquiries. Similar to FICO, it may consolidate [multiple](../m/multiple.md) inquiries related to auto or [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) lending within a short time frame, reducing the impact on the [credit score](../c/credit_score.md).

### Duration of Impact
A hard inquiry stays on a [credit report](../c/credit_report.md) for two years but only affects the [credit score](../c/credit_score.md) for the first 12 months. After this period, while the inquiry remains on the report, it no longer impacts the score.

## Situations that Trigger Hard Inquiries
Several common financial activities can lead to hard inquiries, including:

- **Applying for [Credit](../c/credit.md) Cards**: Every time a consumer applies for a new [credit card](../c/credit_card.md), the [issuer](../i/issuer.md) performs a hard inquiry.
- **[Loan](../l/loan.md) Applications**: This includes mortgages, auto loans, personal loans, and student loans. Each application results in a hard inquiry. 
- **Requesting a [Credit Limit](../c/credit_limit.md) Increase**: Consumers who ask for a higher [credit limit](../c/credit_limit.md) on an existing revolving account may trigger a hard inquiry.
- **Renting an Apartment**: Some landlords or [property management](../p/property_management.md) companies perform hard inquiries during the tenant screening process.
- **Utilities Applications**: Setting up new services such as electricity, gas, or telecommunications may sometimes involve a hard inquiry.

## Managing and Minimizing Hard Inquiries
Consumers can manage the impact of hard inquiries on their [credit score](../c/credit_score.md) by following [best practices](../b/best_practices.md) such as:

- **Limit Applications**: Only applying for [credit](../c/credit.md) when necessary can help limit the number of hard inquiries.
- **Rate Shopping Window**: When shopping for auto loans or mortgages, conduct all inquiries within a short time frame to ensure they are treated as a single inquiry by scoring models.
- **Monitor [Credit](../c/credit.md) Reports**: Regularly reviewing [credit](../c/credit.md) reports helps ensure accuracy and identify any unauthorized hard inquiries. Consumers can get free copies of their [credit](../c/credit.md) reports annually from AnnualCreditReport.com.

## Conclusion
Hard inquiries are a fundamental part of the lending process, serving as a [check](../c/check.md) on a potential borrower’s [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md). While they can have a temporary effect on the [credit score](../c/credit_score.md), understanding how they work and how to manage applications can mitigate their impact. Consumers should be mindful of the contexts that trigger hard inquiries and take strategic steps to maintain their [credit](../c/credit.md) health while pursuing new [credit](../c/credit.md) opportunities.

# Hyperledger Burrow

[Hyperledger](../h/hyperledger.md) Burrow is an [open](../o/open.md)-source [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) framework part of the [Hyperledger](../h/hyperledger.md) Project, created and hosted by The Linux Foundation. It provides a modular [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) client with a permissioned smart contract interpreter developed partly to the specification of the [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) Virtual Machine (EVM). Designed for enterprise use, Burrow allows businesses to [leverage](../l/leverage.md) the benefits of [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) technology in a secure, permissioned environment. 

## Key Features 

### Permissioned Network

[Hyperledger](../h/hyperledger.md) Burrow is specifically designed for permissioned [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) networks, providing a secure environment where access control can be finely tuned according to requirements. This is especially valuable for enterprises where sensitive data and operations need to be tightly controlled.

### Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Compatibility

One of the standout features of [Hyperledger](../h/hyperledger.md) Burrow is its native support for the [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) Virtual Machine (EVM). This allows developers to write [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md) using [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md)'s Solidity language, making it easier to integrate with existing [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md)-based solutions and reducing the [learning curve](../l/learning_curve.md) for new developers transitioning to Burrow.

### Optimized for Performance

Burrow is known for its high performance and low-latency transactions. The architecture is optimized to [handle](../h/handle.md) high [throughput](../t/throughput.md), making it suitable for applications that require fast and reliable [transaction](../t/transaction.md) processing.

### Smart Contract Support

Burrow supports the creation, deployment, and [execution](../e/execution.md) of [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md). Its smart contract interpreter is built for [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) and is alignment with the EVM specification ensures compatibility with existing [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md).

### Modular Architecture

The modular architecture of Burrow allows for flexibility and customization. Various components like consensus, EVM, and RPC can be replaced or extended to fit specific use-cases or performance requirements. 

## Technical Components

### Consensus Engine

[Hyperledger](../h/hyperledger.md) Burrow employs a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus engine called Tendermint. Tendermint is known for its robustness and ability to provide finality, minimizing the [risk](../r/risk.md) of forks and making the system more reliable.

### Application Blockchain Interface (ABCI)

The Application [Blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) Interface (ABCI) is an essential feature that separates the consensus and [networking](../n/networking.md) layers from the application layer. This separation allows developers to build and deploy various types of applications on the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) without modifying its core.

### Application Programming Interface (API)

[Hyperledger](../h/hyperledger.md) Burrow provides a rich set of APIs for interaction with the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md). These APIs support various programming languages, allowing developers to easily integrate Burrow into their existing systems and workflows.

### Node Architecture

Burrow nodes are designed to be lightweight, with an efficient communication protocol that ensures fast and secure data transfer. Nodes can be configured for different roles and tasks within the network, allowing for a flexible and scalable deployment.

## Use Cases

### Supply Chain Management

[Hyperledger](../h/hyperledger.md) Burrowâ€™s permissioned nature makes it well-suited for [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md) management solutions. Businesses can track goods through the [supply chain](../s/supply_chain.md) in a secure, verifiable manner, improving [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and reducing [fraud](../f/fraud.md).

### Financial Services

In the financial [industry](../i/industry.md), Burrow can be used to build secure, permissioned trading platforms where transactions are recorded on the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md), providing an immutable and transparent ledger that's invaluable for compliance and audit purposes.

### Healthcare

[Hyperledger](../h/hyperledger.md) Burrow can streamline healthcare operations by enabling secure sharing of patient records and streamlining clinical trial workflows. The permissioned nature ensures that sensitive information is only accessible to authorized parties.

### Legal and Compliance

Legal contracts and compliance mechanisms can be implemented as [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md) on [Hyperledger](../h/hyperledger.md) Burrow. This ensures that agreements are executed exactly as specified and provides an immutable record that can be used for audit and verification purposes.

## Governance and Community 

[Hyperledger](../h/hyperledger.md) Burrow is governed under the [Hyperledger](../h/hyperledger.md) umbrella and benefits from the collaboration and oversight provided by the Linux Foundation. This ensures that the development of Burrow adheres to stringent quality and [security](../s/security.md) protocols.

## Conclusion

[Hyperledger](../h/hyperledger.md) Burrow offers an enterprise-ready [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) solution that combines [robust](../r/robust.md) [security](../s/security.md) with high performance. Its compatibility with [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md) [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md) and modular architecture make it a versatile and powerful tool for a [range](../r/range.md) of applications spanning various industries. By using a permissioned network and leveraging BFT consensus, Burrow ensures that enterprise applications can operate efficiently and securely, adhering to regulatory and compliance requirements.

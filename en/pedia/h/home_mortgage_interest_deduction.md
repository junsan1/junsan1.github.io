# Home Mortgage Interest Deduction

## Introduction

The [Home Mortgage](../h/home_mortgage.md) [Interest](../i/interest.md) [Deduction](../d/deduction.md) (HMID) is a critical tax [provision](../p/provision.md) in the United States that allows homeowners to deduct [interest](../i/interest.md) paid on their [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) from their [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md). This [deduction](../d/deduction.md) is designed to incentivize [home](../h/home.md) ownership by reducing the overall cost of borrowing to [finance](../f/finance.md) a [home](../h/home.md). Understanding HMID can provide substantial financial benefits and is essential for homeowners looking to maximize their tax savings.

## Eligibility Criteria

To qualify for the HMID, taxpayers must meet various conditions:

1. **Eligible Properties**: Only [interest](../i/interest.md) paid on a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) for a primary residence or a second [home](../h/home.md) qualifies for the [deduction](../d/deduction.md).
2. **[Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) Loans**: The [deduction](../d/deduction.md) applies only to [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) loans that are secured by the primary or secondary residence. In most cases, these include mortgages used to buy, build, or substantially improve the residence.
3. **[Filing Status](../f/filing_status.md)**: Taxpayers must file as individuals, [married filing jointly](../m/married_filing_jointly.md), or heads of household. Estates, trusts, partnerships, and corporations typically do not qualify for the HMID.
4. **[Loan](../l/loan.md) Amount**: As of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, [interest](../i/interest.md) deductions apply to [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [debt](../d/debt.md) up to $750,000 ($375,000 for [married filing separately](../m/married_filing_separately.md)). Mortgages taken out before December 15, 2017, qualify for the previous limit of $1 million ($500,000 if [married filing separately](../m/married_filing_separately.md)).

## Calculation of Deductible Interest

To determine the amount of [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) you can deduct, taxpayers need to:

1. **Obtain [Form 1098](../f/form_1098.md)**: Lenders provide [Form 1098](../f/form_1098.md), which indicates the total amount of [interest](../i/interest.md) paid on the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) during the tax year.
2. **Determine Average [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) Balance**: This is crucial for calculating [interest](../i/interest.md) on large mortgages where specific rules apply.
3. **Use the [Home Mortgage](../h/home_mortgage.md) [Interest](../i/interest.md) Worksheet**: IRS Publication 936 provides a worksheet to help calculate the deductible [interest](../i/interest.md), considering the [loan](../l/loan.md)'s balance and when it was taken out.

## Example Calculation

Assume you took out a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) of $800,000 on your primary residence after the 2017 tax reform. Throughout the year, you paid $30,000 in [interest](../i/interest.md). Since $800,000 exceeds the $750,000 threshold, your deductible [interest](../i/interest.md) is proportionally limited. In this case:

\[ \text{Allowable [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) Balance} = \frac{750,000}{800,000} = 0.9375 \]

\[ \text{Deductible [Interest](../i/interest.md)} = 30,000 \times 0.9375 = 28,125 \]

## AMT Considerations

High-[income](../i/income.md) taxpayers may incur the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), which can limit or nullify the benefits of the HMID. The IRS AMT form and instructions should be consulted to evaluate if this applies.

## Impact of Refinancing

Refinancing your [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) can impact the HMID in several ways:

1. **New [Loan](../l/loan.md) Limitations**: If the refinancing increases the [loan](../l/loan.md) [principal](../p/principal.md), only [interest](../i/interest.md) on the original [principal](../p/principal.md) qualifies for [deduction](../d/deduction.md) under the HMID rules.
2. **Points [Deduction](../d/deduction.md)**: If you pay points to secure a new [loan](../l/loan.md), these can sometimes be deducted immediately, based on certain conditions outlined by the IRS.

## Legislative History

The HMID has undergone numerous changes:

1. **1986 Tax Reform Act**: First introduced the HMID, allowing deductions on [interest](../i/interest.md) paid for mortgages up to $1 million.
2. **2007 [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) Forgiveness [Debt](../d/debt.md) Relief Act**: Temporarily allowed taxpayers to exclude forgiven [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [debt](../d/debt.md) from [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md).
3. **Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017**: Most recent overhaul, reducing the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [interest](../i/interest.md) [deduction](../d/deduction.md) limit to $750,000 for new loans.

## Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit

[Interest](../i/interest.md) paid on [home equity](../h/home_equity.md) loans or lines of [credit](../c/credit.md) was previously deductible, but post-2017 reforms limited this to loans used for [home](../h/home.md) improvement purposes.

## Interaction with State Taxes

Several states follow federal guidelines for HMID, but differences may exist. State-specific tax codes should be checked to understand allowable deductions and calculations.

## Conclusion

The [Home Mortgage](../h/home_mortgage.md) [Interest](../i/interest.md) [Deduction](../d/deduction.md) remains a significant aspect of the U.S. tax code, [offering](../o/offering.md) substantial financial relief to qualifying homeowners. Understanding and correctly applying the HMID can lead to substantial tax savings, though changes in tax law and personal circumstances necessitate regular review and potential consultation with a tax professional.

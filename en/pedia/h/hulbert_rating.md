# Hulbert Rating

## Introduction
The Hulbert Rating is a metric used to evaluate the performance of financial newsletters, focusing on their stock and bond market recommendations. Developed by journalist Mark Hulbert, the rating provides investors with an independent and sophisticated tool to assess the accuracy and reliability of investment advice from a multitude of financial publications. The purpose of the Hulbert Rating is to sift through the noise and help investors make more informed decisions by highlighting those newsletters that have consistently provided profitable advice over time.

## History and Background
Mark Hulbert founded the Hulbert Financial Digest in 1980 to objectively track the performance of financial newsletters. Prior to this, investors had little means to independently verify the track records claimed by these newsletters. The Digest built its reputation on transparency and meticulous tracking, and it quickly became a go-to resource for investors looking to vet financial recommendations.

The Hulbert Rating has since become a respected benchmark, embodying standards of precision and accountability. Published monthly, the Hulbert Financial Digest provided a performance summary for each newsletter it covered, offering insights into their legitimacy and effectiveness.

## Methodology
The Hulbert Rating employs a rigorous and systematic methodology to assess financial newsletters. Here are the key components:

### Data Collection
Data in the Hulbert Rating is collected by analyzing specific buy and sell recommendations from newsletters. Each recommendation is meticulously tracked for performance, providing a comprehensive dataset for later analysis.

### Performance Metrics
Various performance metrics are utilized, including:

1. **Absolute Return**: Measures the total return of an investment over a specified period.
2. **Risk-Adjusted Return**: Considers the volatility of the returns, offering a more nuanced view by accounting for risk.
3. **Alpha**: Represents the excess return of an investment relative to the return of a benchmark index.
4. **Beta**: Gauges the sensitivity of an investment’s returns to market movements.

### Time Frames
The Hulbert rating assesses performance over multiple time frames—short-term (1 year), medium-term (3 years), and long-term (5+ years). This multi-dimensional approach ensures a balanced evaluation, reflecting both short-term tactical moves and long-term strategic advice.

### Consistency and Adjustments
Performance is evaluated not only on raw returns but also on consistency. Newsletters that offer steady returns over time are rated higher than those with erratic performance. Adjustments are also made for market conditions, making it possible to discern whether a publication thrives in varying economic climates.

## Key Players
Several well-known financial newsletters have been evaluated using the Hulbert Rating. Examples include:

- **Investor Advisory Service**
- **The Prudent Speculator**
- **Kiplinger’s Personal Finance**

These newsletters are assessed on an ongoing basis, ensuring that their ratings remain relevant and accurate over time.

## Applications of the Hulbert Rating
The Hulbert Rating serves multiple functions across different types of users:

### Individual Investors
Retail investors use the Hulbert Rating to make better-informed decisions regarding which newsletters to follow. By relying on an independent assessment, they can sidestep newsletters with exaggerated claims and focus on those with proven track records.

### Financial Advisors
Advisors employ the Hulbert Rating to vet external advice and recommendations. This ensures that their own advice is grounded in well-substantiated analysis, thereby enhancing their value to clients.

### Institutions
Institutional investors leverage the Hulbert Rating to benchmark the external analyses they consider. By doing so, they incorporate only the highest quality third-party research into their investment strategies.

## Impact and Criticism
### Positive Impact
The Hulbert Rating has had a considerable positive impact on the investment community by promoting transparency and accountability. Newsletters are incentivized to improve their methodologies and track records, knowing that their performance will be rigorously scrutinized. Additionally, investors benefit from a reliable tool to navigate the crowded field of financial advice.

### Criticism
Despite its merits, the Hulbert Rating has faced criticism. Critics argue that the methodology might not fully account for varying risk tolerance levels among investors. Others contend that past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results, a common caveat in financial markets.

## Current Developments
The landscape of financial newsletters and their evaluation has evolved with the advent of digital platforms and big data. The Hulbert Financial Digest has adapted by incorporating real-time data and analytics, making ratings more dynamic and responsive to market conditions. Additionally, the Digest has expanded its coverage to include newsletters focused on alternative investments and emerging markets.

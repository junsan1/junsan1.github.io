# Hulbert Rating

## Introduction
The Hulbert [Rating](../r/rating.md) is a metric used to evaluate the performance of financial newsletters, focusing on their stock and [bond market](../b/bond_market.md) recommendations. Developed by journalist Mark Hulbert, the [rating](../r/rating.md) provides investors with an independent and sophisticated tool to assess the accuracy and reliability of investment advice from a multitude of financial publications. The purpose of the Hulbert [Rating](../r/rating.md) is to sift through the [noise](../n/noise.md) and help investors make more informed decisions by highlighting those newsletters that have consistently provided profitable advice over time.

## History and Background
Mark Hulbert founded the Hulbert Financial Digest in 1980 to objectively track the performance of financial newsletters. Prior to this, investors had little means to independently verify the track records claimed by these newsletters. The Digest built its reputation on [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and meticulous tracking, and it quickly became a go-to resource for investors looking to vet financial recommendations.

The Hulbert [Rating](../r/rating.md) has since become a respected [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md), embodying standards of precision and accountability. Published monthly, the Hulbert Financial Digest provided a performance summary for each newsletter it covered, [offering](../o/offering.md) insights into their legitimacy and effectiveness.

## Methodology
The Hulbert [Rating](../r/rating.md) employs a rigorous and systematic methodology to assess financial newsletters. Here are the key components:

### Data Collection
Data in the Hulbert [Rating](../r/rating.md) is collected by analyzing specific buy and sell recommendations from newsletters. Each recommendation is meticulously tracked for performance, providing a comprehensive dataset for later analysis.

### Performance Metrics
Various [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md) are utilized, including:

1. **[Absolute Return](../a/absolute_return.md)**: Measures the [total return](../t/total_return.md) of an investment over a specified period.
2. **[Risk-Adjusted Return](../r/risk-adjusted_return.md)**: Considers the [volatility](../v/volatility.md) of the returns, [offering](../o/offering.md) a more nuanced view by [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for [risk](../r/risk.md).
3. **[Alpha](../a/alpha.md)**: Represents the [excess return](../e/excess_return.md) of an investment relative to the [return](../r/return.md) of a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) [index](../i/index_instrument.md).
4. **[Beta](../b/beta.md)**: Gauges the sensitivity of an investment’s returns to [market](../m/market.md) movements.

### Time Frames
The Hulbert [rating](../r/rating.md) assesses performance over [multiple](../m/multiple.md) time frames—short-term (1 year), medium-term (3 years), and long-term (5+ years). This multi-dimensional approach ensures a balanced evaluation, reflecting both short-term tactical moves and long-term strategic advice.

### Consistency and Adjustments
Performance is evaluated not only on raw returns but also on consistency. Newsletters that [offer](../o/offer.md) steady returns over time are rated higher than those with erratic performance. Adjustments are also made for [market](../m/market.md) conditions, making it possible to discern whether a publication thrives in varying economic climates.

# High Street Bank

A high street [bank](../b/bank.md), also known as a retail [bank](../b/bank.md), is a [bank](../b/bank.md) that provides financial services to the general public. These services typically include personal banking (current and savings accounts), mortgages, personal loans, [credit](../c/credit.md) cards, and more. High street banks have physical branches on the main streets of towns and cities, making them highly accessible to the public. In contrast to [investment banks](../i/investment_bank_(ib).md), which cater to large corporations and governments, high street banks mainly serve individual consumers and small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

## History and Evolution

The concept of high street banking dates back to medieval Italy, where [money](../m/money.md) changers would carry out their businesses at benches or "bancas" in public places. The term "high street [bank](../b/bank.md)" itself originates from the UK, where the “high street” refers to the [main street](../m/main_street.md) in town and city centers that host a wide array of shops, services, and businesses.

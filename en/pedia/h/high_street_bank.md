# High Street Bank

A high street bank, also known as a retail bank, is a bank that provides financial services to the general public. These services typically include personal banking (current and savings accounts), mortgages, personal loans, credit cards, and more. High street banks have physical branches on the main streets of towns and cities, making them highly accessible to the public. In contrast to investment banks, which cater to large corporations and governments, high street banks mainly serve individual consumers and small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

## History and Evolution

The concept of high street banking dates back to medieval Italy, where money changers would carry out their businesses at benches or "bancas" in public places. The term "high street bank" itself originates from the UK, where the “high street” refers to the main street in town and city centers that host a wide array of shops, services, and businesses. Over time, high street banks have evolved considerably:

### Early Banking

In the 17th and 18th centuries, early forms of retail banking emerged in Europe. The Bank of England, established in 1694, is one of the oldest institutions of its kind. Initially, banks were primarily engaged in accepting deposits and providing loans to governments and merchants.

### The Industrial Revolution

The Industrial Revolution (18th to 19th centuries) brought significant economic and social changes, resulting in a burgeoning middle class that required banking services. This period witnessed the establishment of many banks that aimed to cater to the financial needs of individuals and small businesses.

### The 20th Century and Beyond

The 20th century saw the globalization of markets and the proliferation of financial products and services. The advent of technology in the latter half of the century transformed banking altogether, leading to the development of ATMs, credit cards, and online banking.

### National Regulations

Individual countries have their own regulatory bodies and frameworks. For instance, in the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) oversee the operations of high street banks. In the US, banks are regulated by various agencies including the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

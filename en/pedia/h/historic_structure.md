# Historical Structures

Algorithmic trading, often referred to as algo trading, has seen significant advances since its inception. This method uses computer algorithms to automate trading processes, enabling faster and often more accurate market predictions and transactions than traditional methods. Historically, the evolution of algorithmic trading can be divided into several stages, marked by both technological advancements and regulatory changes. This deep dive into the historic structure of algorithmic trading illustrates how it has grown from rudimentary beginnings into a cornerstone of modern finance.

## Early Beginnings: Manual to Digital Transition

### Hand Signals and Chalkboards

Before the digital revolution, stock exchanges were chaotic places where brokers and traders used open outcry systems. Hand signals and verbal commands were the norms, and transactions were recorded manually. This environment was prone to human error and inefficiency. 

### Introduction of Electronic Communication Networks (ECNs)

The late 20th century saw the introduction of Electronic Communication Networks (ECNs), which allowed for the electronic matching of buy and sell orders. These systems, such as Instinet, launched in 1969, formed the foundation for modern algorithmic trading by enabling faster and more efficient trading without the need for human intermediaries.

## The 1980s and 1990s: The Rise of Program Trading

### Portfolio Insurance

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, portfolio insurance strategies, which attempted to combine stock positions with derivative hedges, became the first form of automated trading. This era is noted for its role in the 1987 Black Monday crash, where computerized trading algorithms exacerbated the market collapse.

### SEC Rule 10b-10 and Increased Regulation

In response to the 1987 crash, new regulations like SEC Rule 10b-10 were implemented to provide greater transparency in trading. These regulations laid the groundwork for more sophisticated and compliant algorithmic strategies.

### Emergence of Quantitative Models

The 1990s saw a surge in quantitative models which utilized statistical methods and speed improvements in computing power. Firms like Renaissance Technologies, founded by Jim Simons, became pioneers in using quantitative models for algorithmic trading. These models relied on historical data and complex mathematical indicators to make trading decisions.

## The 2000s: The Algorithmic Boom

### Technological Advancements

The early 2000s experienced a boom in algorithmic trading, supported by exponential growth in computational capabilities and data storage. This period also witnessed the proliferation of high-frequency trading (HFT), which executes a high number of orders at extremely fast speeds.

### Flash Trading and Dark Pools

New trading venues, such as dark pools—private exchanges for trading large amounts of securities without exposing intentions—became popular. Flash trading, a type of HFT, used milliseconds of market data to predict market movements, raising significant regulatory concerns.

### Regulatory Backlash

Incidents like the 2010 Flash Crash, where the market dropped 1,000 points in minutes due to algorithmic inefficiencies, led to increased scrutiny and regulation of HFT and algo trading. The SEC and other regulatory bodies required more stringent measures for algorithm transparency and accountability.

## 2010s to Present: Machine Learning and AI

### The Role of Machine Learning

The integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence has revolutionized algorithmic trading in the 2010s and beyond. Machine learning algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data more quickly and accurately, recognizing patterns that humans might miss. Companies like Two Sigma and Citadel have been at the forefront of incorporating AI into their trading strategies.

### Blockchain and Cryptocurrency

The rise of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies has opened new frontiers for algorithmic trading. Algorithms now not only trade traditional securities but also handle digital assets. Exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken have developed robust infrastructures for algorithmic trading in the crypto space.

### Ethical Concerns and Fairness

There has been growing concern regarding the ethical implications of algorithmic trading. Issues of market fairness, data privacy, and the potential for market manipulation by sophisticated algorithms have led to ongoing debates and legislative efforts to ensure a fair trading environment for all participants.

## Key Players and Their Contributions

# Holding Period Return (Yield)

The [Holding Period Return](../h/holding_period_return.md) (HPR), or [yield](../y/yield.md), is a critical concept in [finance](../f/finance.md) and investment, and it is especially relevant in the context of [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md). HPR measures the [total return](../t/total_return.md) that an investment generates over the entire period it is held. This [return](../r/return.md) includes [capital](../c/capital.md) gains or losses as well as any [income](../i/income.md) like dividends or [interest](../i/interest.md) that the investment generates.

## Definition and Calculation

[Holding Period Return](../h/holding_period_return.md) can be expressed mathematically through the following formula:

\[ \text{HPR} = \frac{\text{Ending Value of Investment} - \text{Beginning Value of Investment} + \text{[Income](../i/income.md) Received}}{\text{Beginning [Value](../v/value.md) of Investment}} \]

Where:
- **Ending [Value](../v/value.md) of Investment** is the [market value](../m/market_value.md) of the investment at the end of the [holding period](../h/holding_period.md).
- **Beginning [Value](../v/value.md) of Investment** is the [market value](../m/market_value.md) at the beginning.
- **[Income](../i/income.md) Received** includes dividends, [interest](../i/interest.md), or any other forms of [income](../i/income.md) received over the [holding period](../h/holding_period.md).

Alternatively, HPR can be simplified as:

\[ \text{HPR} = \frac{P_1 - P_0 + D}{P_0} \]

Where:
- \( P_1 \) is the ending price.
- \( P_0 \) is the beginning price.
- \( D \) represents dividends or [interest](../i/interest.md) [income](../i/income.md).

### Example

Suppose an [investor](../i/investor.md) purchases a stock at $100, holds it for one year, receives $5 in dividends, and sells it for $110. The HPR would be calculated as:

\[ \text{HPR} = \frac{110 - 100 + 5}{100} = 0.15 \text{ or } 15\% \]

## Importance in Algorithmic Trading

### Performance Measurement

In [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), HPR is used to measure the performance of specific [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) or strategies. Since algorithms are designed to execute trades based on pre-defined criteria, HPR provides a straightforward way to gauge their success by assessing the returns generated over a particular period.

### Strategy Optimization

Algorithmic traders often aim to optimize their strategies to maximize returns. By analyzing historical HPR data, quantitative analysts can adjust their models and parameters to improve future performance. For instance, if a particular algorithm shows a consistently high HPR, it might be fine-tuned further to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on favorable [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

### Risk Management

While high HPRs are desirable, they should be considered alongside [risk metrics](../r/risk_metrics.md). A strategy with a high HPR but also high [volatility](../v/volatility.md) might not be preferable compared to one with a slightly lower HPR but better [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted returns. Commonly used [risk metrics](../r/risk_metrics.md) include the [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md), [Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md), and [Value](../v/value.md) at [Risk](../r/risk.md) (VaR).

## Extensions and Variations

### Annualized HPR

To compare investments held over different periods, the HPR can be annualized. The annualized HPR accounts for the length of the [holding period](../h/holding_period.md) and translates the [return](../r/return.md) into an annual figure. The formula is:

\[ \text{Annualized HPR} = (1 + \text{HPR})^{\frac{1}{n}} - 1 \]

Where \( n \) is the number of years the investment was held.

### Real vs. Nominal HPR

[Nominal](../n/nominal.md) HPR does not account for [inflation](../i/inflation.md), whereas Real HPR does. Real HPR adjusts the [nominal](../n/nominal.md) [return](../r/return.md) by considering the [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rate, providing a more accurate reflection of the investment's [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md). The formula is:

\[ \text{Real HPR} ≈ \frac{1 + \text{Nominal HPR}}{1 + \text{[Inflation](../i/inflation.md) Rate}} - 1 \]

### Gross vs. Net HPR

Gross HPR includes overall returns without deducting any costs such as [transaction fees](../t/transaction_fees.md), [taxes](../t/taxes.md), or management fees. Net HPR adjusts the gross [return](../r/return.md) by subtracting these expenses. Net HPR gives a true measure of the [investor](../i/investor.md)'s actual [return](../r/return.md).

## Practical Implications

### Selecting Algorithms

Traders use HPR to assess which algorithms to deploy in live trading. [Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) [multiple](../m/multiple.md) algorithms and comparing their HPRs helps traders select the most promising strategies. 

### Identifying Holding Period

HPR can provide insights into the optimal [holding period](../h/holding_period.md) for assets. By analyzing HPR over different periods, traders can identify durations that maximize returns and minimize losses.

### Balancing Portfolios

Investment portfolios can be balanced by analyzing the HPR of different assets. [Diversification strategies](../d/diversification_strategies.md) often consider the HPR alongside other metrics for constructing portfolios that [offer](../o/offer.md) [robust](../r/robust.md) returns and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md).

## Case Study

Consider a [hedge fund](../h/hedge_fund.md) that employs several algorithmic strategies. Strategy A shows an HPR of 20% over six months, while Strategy B has an HPR of 25% over a year. Initially, Strategy B appears superior, but an annualized comparison would be necessary to make a fair assessment:

- Annualized HPR for Strategy A:
\[ \text{Annualized HPR} = (1 + 0.20)^{2} - 1 = 0.44 \text{ or } 44\% \]

- Annualized HPR for Strategy B:
\[ \text{Annualized HPR} = (1 + 0.25)^{1} - 1 = 0.25 \text{ or } 25\% \]

In this case, Strategy A shows a higher annualized [return](../r/return.md), suggesting it might be more effective in generating returns over a year.

## Software and Tools

### MATLAB

MATLAB is widely used in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) for [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) and [optimization](../o/optimization.md). The Financial Toolbox in MATLAB provides functions to calculate HPR, evaluate [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md), and simulate various [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

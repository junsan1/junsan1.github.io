# Hybrid Security

Hybrid securities represent a special class of financial instruments that encompass characteristics of both equities and debts. This form of [security](../s/security.md) offers a blend of potential for growth and [fixed income](../f/fixed_income.md), making it an intriguing option for investors looking for both regular [income](../i/income.md) and opportunities for [capital](../c/capital.md) appreciation.

### Types of Hybrid Securities

Hybrid securities can be broadly categorized into several types, based on their structure and specific features. Some common forms include:

- **Convertible Bonds**: These are bonds that can be converted into a specified number of [shares](../s/shares.md) of the issuing company, usually at the discretion of the [bondholder](../b/bondholder.md). The conversion usually occurs at certain conditions predefined at the time of issuance.
- **Convertible [Preference Shares](../p/preference_shares.md)**: These are [preference shares](../p/preference_shares.md) that holders can convert into ordinary [shares](../s/shares.md) at certain points in time under specified conditions.
- **[Capital](../c/capital.md) Notes**: These are long-term [subordinated debt](../s/subordinated_debt.md) instruments, often having features like convertibility into [equity](../e/equity.md) or step-up clauses that adjust the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) over time.
- **[Contingent Convertible](../c/contingent_convertible.md) Bonds (CoCo Bonds)**: These are a type of hybrid [security](../s/security.md) designed mainly for financial institutions. CoCo bonds convert into [equity](../e/equity.md) or get written down when certain pre-specified conditions are met, typically related to the [bank](../b/bank.md)â€™s [capital](../c/capital.md) ratios.

### Advantages of Hybrid Securities

Hybrid securities provide several benefits to different stakeholders, including issuers and investors:

- **Issuers**: For companies, issuing hybrid securities can be an effective way to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) without increasing their [debt](../d/debt.md) burden excessively. Hybrid securities often do not count as a direct [liability](../l/liability.md) on the balance sheets.
- **Investors**: Investors benefit from regular [income](../i/income.md) through coupons or dividends, as well as potential [capital](../c/capital.md) gains if the hybrid [security](../s/security.md) converts to [equity](../e/equity.md). This blend of [fixed income](../f/fixed_income.md) and opportunity for growth makes hybrids attractive, especially in a low-[interest](../i/interest.md)-rate environment.

### Risks and Considerations

Though hybrid securities [offer](../o/offer.md) [multiple](../m/multiple.md) advantages, they also come with inherent risks that require careful consideration:

- **[Credit Risk](../c/credit_risk.md)**: Since hybrid securities are often subordinated, they sit lower in the [capital structure](../c/capital_structure.md) hierarchy. This means that in case of [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md), hybrid [security](../s/security.md) holders are paid after senior [debt](../d/debt.md) holders.
- **[Market Risk](../m/market_risk.md)**: The values of hybrid securities can be more volatile due to their [equity](../e/equity.md)-like features. Fluctuations in the [stock market](../s/stock_market.md) can significantly impact their prices.
- **[Liquidity Risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md)**: Hybrid securities may not be as [liquid](../l/liquid.md) as ordinary [shares](../s/shares.md) or standard [debt](../d/debt.md) instruments. Limited [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) can pose challenges for investors looking to buy or sell in secondary markets.
- **Complexity**: The structural complexity of hybrid securities, especially features like conversion ratios, [contingency](../c/contingency.md) triggers, or step-up clauses, can make them difficult for investors to understand fully.

### Real-World Example

A prominent example of hybrid securities in action is the issuance of CoCo bonds by major financial institutions. According to Deutsche [Bank](../b/bank.md):

    "CoCo bonds are loss-absorbing instruments that convert into [equity](../e/equity.md) or are written down in the event of 'trigger events' to help banks meet regulatory [capital](../c/capital.md) requirements." [Source](https://www.db.com)

Such instruments became more popular following the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md) of 2008 as regulatory bodies like [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md) mandated stronger [capital](../c/capital.md) structures for banks.

### Conclusion

Hybrid securities [offer](../o/offer.md) a distinctive combination of [equity](../e/equity.md) and [debt](../d/debt.md) characteristics, appealing to both issuers and investors who are looking for flexible investment [options](../o/options.md). While the potential for both [income](../i/income.md) and [capital](../c/capital.md) appreciation is enticing, the intrinsic risks and complex structures mean that both parties need to conduct thorough [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md) before engaging with these financial instruments.

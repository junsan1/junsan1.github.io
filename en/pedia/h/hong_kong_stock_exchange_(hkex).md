# Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX)

The Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) is one of the largest and most significant financial markets in the world. It serves as a hub for international finance and investment, offering a platform for companies to raise capital and for investors to buy and sell securities. HKEX is not only pivotal for the Hong Kong economy but also acts as a critical gateway for global investors looking to access Chinese markets. This document explores various aspects of HKEX, including its history, market structure, listing requirements, trading mechanisms, and significance in global finance.

## History of HKEX

### Establishment and Early Years

The Hong Kong Stock Exchange traces its origins to the late 19th century. Originally established in 1891, the stock market has evolved significantly over the years. Initially, it began as an informal gathering of brokers, and it wasn't until 1914 that the first formal stock exchange, known as the Hong Kong Stockbrokers' Association, was established.

### Mergers and Reforms

Throughout the 20th century, the exchange saw numerous mergers and reforms. In 1986, four major stock exchanges in Hong Kong merged to form the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK). This consolidation aimed to streamline market operations and enhance regulatory oversight.

### Modern Era and Digital Transformations

In 2000, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange went public and became known as Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX), following the merger of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Futures Exchange, and the Hong Kong Securities Clearing Company. With advancements in technology, HKEX has since embraced digital transformations to offer more efficient and secure trading.

## Market Structure

### Main Board

The Main Board of HKEX is where established companies list their shares. It is the primary market for large firms looking to raise significant capital. Companies listed on the Main Board are subject to stringent regulatory requirements and must adhere to high standards of disclosure and corporate governance.

### Growth Enterprise Market (GEM)

The GEM serves as a platform for smaller, growth-oriented firms. It provides an avenue for startups and emerging companies to access capital markets. Listing requirements for GEM are less stringent compared to the Main Board, making it more accessible to smaller businesses.

### Bond Connect, Stock Connect, and Other Initiatives

Several innovative programs such as Bond Connect and Stock Connect have been introduced to enhance cross-border investment between Hong Kong and Mainland China. These initiatives facilitate direct market access and trading between the two regions, significantly boosting liquidity and investor participation.

## Listing Requirements

### Main Board Listing Requirements

#### Financial Criteria

Companies aspiring to list on the Main Board must meet specific financial criteria, including minimum profit thresholds and revenue benchmarks. Typically, a company must have a minimum profit of HKD 20 million in the most recent financial year and an aggregate profit of HKD 30 million over the last three years.

#### Shareholder Requirements

A minimum public float and a certain number of shareholders are also required. Specifically, companies must have at least 300-500 shareholders, depending on the market capitalization at the time of listing.

#### Financial and Operational Track Record

For GEM, the financial and operational track record requirements are more relaxed. Companies must demonstrate a positive cash flow from operating activities of at least HKD 30 million over the two preceding financial years.

#### Management Continuity

Continuity of management and ownership is also critical, with at least 24 months of continuous ownership and management in the same line of business required before listing on the GEM.

## History of HKEX

### Establishment and Early Years

The Hong Kong Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) traces its origins to the late 19th century. Originally established in 1891, the [stock market](../s/stock_market.md) has evolved significantly over the years. Initially, it began as an informal gathering of brokers, and it wasn't until 1914 that the first formal stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md), known as the Hong Kong Stockbrokers' Association, was established.

### Mergers and Reforms

Throughout the 20th century, the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) saw numerous mergers and reforms. In 1986, four major stock exchanges in Hong Kong merged to form the Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) of Hong Kong (SEHK). This [consolidation](../c/consolidation.md) aimed to streamline [market](../m/market.md) operations and enhance regulatory oversight.

### Modern Era and Digital Transformations

In 2000, the Hong Kong Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) went public and became known as Hong Kong Exchanges and [Clearing](../c/clearing.md) Limited (HKEX), following the [merger](../m/merger.md) of the Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) of Hong Kong, Hong Kong [Futures](../f/futures.md) [Exchange](../e/exchange.md), and the Hong Kong Securities [Clearing](../c/clearing.md) Company. With advancements in technology, HKEX has since embraced digital transformations to [offer](../o/offer.md) more efficient and secure trading.

### Main Board

The Main Board of HKEX is where established companies list their [shares](../s/shares.md).

### Bond Connect, Stock Connect, and Other Initiatives

Several innovative programs such as [Bond](../b/bond.md) Connect and Stock Connect have been introduced to enhance cross-border investment between Hong Kong and Mainland China.

# Health Savings Account (HSA)

A Health [Savings Account](../s/savings_account.md) (HSA) is a [tax-advantaged](../t/tax-advantaged.md) medical [savings account](../s/savings_account.md) available to taxpayers in the United States who are enrolled in a High-Deductible Health Plan (HDHP). Funds contributed to an HSA are not subject to [federal income](../f/federal_income.md) tax at the time of [deposit](../d/deposit.md). Unlike a Flexible Spending Account (FSA), which is an employer-sponsored benefit, an HSA is individually owned, although employers can also contribute to their employees' HSAs.

## Overview of Features

### Tax Advantages
One of the primary benefits of an HSA is its [tax-advantaged](../t/tax-advantaged.md) status. Contributions to an HSA are tax-deductible, meaning they reduce your [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md) for the year in which the contribution is made. The funds in the HSA can grow [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md), and withdrawals for qualified medical expenses are also [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md).

### High-Deductible Health Plan (HDHP)
To contribute to an HSA, you must be enrolled in a High-Deductible Health Plan. As of 2023, the IRS defines an HDHP as a health plan with a minimum deductible of $1,400 for individuals and $2,800 for families. The HDHP must also have a maximum [out-of-pocket limit](../o/out-of-pocket_limit.md) of $7,050 for individuals and $14,100 for families.

### Contribution Limits
The IRS sets annual contribution limits for HSAs. For 2023, the contribution limit is $3,850 for individual coverage and $7,750 for family coverage. Additionally, individuals aged 55 and older can contribute an extra $1,000 as a catch-up contribution.

### Roll-over and Portability
Unlike FSAs, HSAs are not subject to the "use it or lose it" rule. The funds in the account roll over from year to year, and you do not lose the [money](../m/money.md) if you do not spend it within a given year. Furthermore, HSAs are portable, meaning you retain ownership of the funds even if you change employers or leave the workforce.

## Eligible Expenses

The IRS has a broad list of qualified medical expenses that can be paid for with HSA funds. These include but are not limited to:

- Doctor's visits and copays
- Prescription medications
- Dental services
- Vision care
- Mental health services
- Chiropractic care

It's essential to keep [receipts](../r/receipt.md) and documentation for all HSA expenditures, as any [money](../m/money.md) spent on non-qualified medical expenses [will](../w/will.md) be subject to [income tax](../i/income_tax.md) and an additional 20% penalty if you are under the age of 65.

## Investment Opportunities

Many HSA account holders use the account as a savings and [investment vehicle](../i/investment_vehicle.md). While the specifics can vary depending on the HSA provider, most allow you to invest your funds in various [options](../o/options.md) similar to a 401(k) or IRA, such as:

- Mutual funds
- [Stocks](../s/stock.md)
- Bonds
- [Exchange](../e/exchange.md)-Traded Funds (ETFs)

[Interest](../i/interest.md) and investment [earnings](../e/earnings.md) in an HSA are [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md) as long as they remain in the account or are used for qualified medical expenses.

## HSA Providers

Several financial institutions and companies [offer](../o/offer.md) HSA management services, each with its own set of fees, investment [options](../o/options.md), and features. Some well-known providers include:

- **[HSA Bank](https://www.hsabank.com)**
- **[HealthEquity](https://www.healthequity.com)**
- **[Lively](https://www.livelyme.com)**
- **[Fidelity](https://www.fidelity.com/go/hsa-what-is-an-hsa)**
- **[Optum Bank](https://www.optumbank.com)**
  
Selecting the right HSA provider involves evaluating factors such as account fees, investment [options](../o/options.md), and [customer service](../c/customer_service.md).

## Integration with Employer Benefits

Many employers [offer](../o/offer.md) HSAs as part of their benefits package. Employers may make contributions to their employees' HSAs, either as a one-time contribution or as regular contributions throughout the year. These contributions are often tax-deductible for the employer and [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md) for the employee.

## Planning for Retirement

One of the strategic uses of an HSA is planning for retirement healthcare costs. HSAs can serve as a long-term savings vehicle, as the contributions can accumulate and grow [tax-free](../t/tax_free.md). After the age of 65, you can withdraw HSA funds for any purpose without paying the 20% penalty, although such withdrawals [will](../w/will.md) be subject to [income tax](../i/income_tax.md) if not used for qualified medical expenses.

## Limitations and Considerations

Despite the many benefits, there are also limitations and considerations to keep in mind:

- **High-Deductible Requirement**: An HSA requires a high-deductible health plan, which might not be suitable for everyone, especially those with significant or chronic medical expenses.
- **Contribution Limits**: The annual contribution limits may restrict your ability to save as much as you might want for future medical expenses.
- **Record-Keeping**: It's crucial to maintain accurate records of all HSA expenditures to avoid tax penalties for non-qualified expenses.

## Conclusion

Health Savings Accounts [offer](../o/offer.md) significant tax advantages and flexibility, making them an attractive option for individuals with high-deductible health plans. Whether used to cover current medical expenses or as a long-term investment for future healthcare needs, HSAs can be a valuable component of a comprehensive [financial plan](../f/financial_plan.md). By carefully selecting an HSA provider and understanding the rules and benefits, individuals can maximize the [value](../v/value.md) of their Health [Savings Account](../s/savings_account.md).

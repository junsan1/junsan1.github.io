# Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP)

## Introduction to HAMP

The [Home](../h/home.md) Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) was a government initiative introduced in March 2009 as part of the broader Making [Home](../h/home.md) Affordable (MHA) program. This program aimed to help homeowners who were struggling to make [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) payments by providing them with opportunities to modify their loans and avoid [foreclosure](../f/foreclosure.md). It was a response to the housing crisis which was a significant contributing [factor](../f/factor.md) to the [Great Recession](../g/great_recession.md) of 2008. The HAMP program primarily targeted homeowners at [risk](../r/risk.md) of [foreclosure](../f/foreclosure.md) and aimed to make [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) payments more affordable and sustainable over the long term.

## Purpose and Goals

The overarching goals of HAMP were:

1. To increase housing stability.
2. To prevent homeowners from facing [foreclosure](../f/foreclosure.md).
3. To stabilize the housing [market](../m/market.md) and ensure confidence in the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md).

## Eligibility Criteria

To qualify for HAMP, several criteria had to be met by the homeowners:

1. **[Loan](../l/loan.md) [Origination](../o/origination.md) Date**: The [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) had to have been originated on or before January 1, 2009.
2. **Property Status**: The property must be a one- to four-unit residential property, and occupied as a primary residence.
3. **Financial Hardship**: The homeowner must be facing a financial hardship and experiencing difficulty paying their [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md).
4. **Delinquency Status**: Homeowners had to either be [delinquent](../d/delinquent.md) or near delinquency on their [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) payments.
5. **[Debt](../d/debt.md)-to-[Income](../i/income.md) Ratio (DTI)**: Homeowners needed to have a DTI ratio (calculated as housing expenses over [gross income](../g/gross_income.md)) above 31%.

## Modification Process

The [loan modification](../l/loan_modification.md) process under HAMP involved several steps:

1. **Initial Consultation**: Homeowners had to contact their [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) servicer to express [interest](../i/interest.md) in HAMP.
2. **Application Submission**: Homeowners needed to submit a detailed application, including financial information, hardship affidavit, tax returns, and proof of [income](../i/income.md).
3. **Trial Period Plan (TPP)**: If preliminary evaluations suggested eligibility, the homeowner entered a trial period typically lasting three months. During this time, they had to make reduced [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) payments.
4. **Final Modification**: Upon successful completion of the TPP, the modification became permanent. The terms could include reduced [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, extended [loan](../l/loan.md) terms, or even [principal](../p/principal.md) [forbearance](../f/forbearance.md).

## Financial Mechanism

HAMP operated through incentives:

1. **Incentives to Servicers**: [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) servicers were given financial incentives by the Treasury Department for successfully modifying mortgages.
2. **Incentives to Investors**: In cases where [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) loans were securitized, incentives were also provided to investors for obtaining modification agreements.
3. **Borrower Incentives**: Homeowners could receive incentives in the form of [principal](../p/principal.md) reduction or forgiveness if they kept current on their modified mortgages.

## Outcome and Impact

The HAMP program helped millions of homeowners by modifying their [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) loans. It was credited with reducing monthly payments by about $530 on average, making homeownership more sustainable for many families. However, its effectiveness was also subject to debate, with some critics arguing that the scale of the problem was too large for HAMP to address fully.

## Participating Institutions

Major banks and [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) servicers participated in the HAMP program. Some of the prominent institutions include:

- **JPMorgan Chase**: <https://www.jpmorganchase.com>
- **[Bank](../b/bank.md) of America**: <https://www.bankofamerica.com>
- **Wells Fargo**: <https://www.wellsfargo.com>
- **CitiMortgage**: <https://www.citi.com>
- **Ocwen Financial [Corporation](../c/corporation.md)**: <https://www.ocwen.com>

## Criticisms and Challenges

Despite its success in helping many homeowners, HAMP faced several criticisms:

1. **Slow Implementation**: Initial rollout was slow, and many homeowners faced long delays in getting their loans modified.
2. **Complex Documentation**: The application process was complex, requiring significant documentation that many homeowners found difficult to provide.
3. **Limited [Scope](../s/scope.md)**: Critics argued that the program's [scope](../s/scope.md) was insufficient given the magnitude of the housing crisis.
4. **Permanent Modifications**: Many homeowners who entered the trial period did not receive permanent modifications, leading to frustration and further [financial distress](../f/financial_distress.md).

## Program Termination

On December 31, 2016, the HAMP program officially ended. It ceased accepting new applications, though existing modifications and agreements continued to be honored. Its termination marked the end of one of the most significant government interventions in the housing [market](../m/market.md) in response to the [Great Recession](../g/great_recession.md).

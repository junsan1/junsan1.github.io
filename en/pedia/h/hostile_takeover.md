# Hostile Takeover

A hostile [takeover](../t/takeover.md) is a type of [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) in which the target company is unwilling to be bought or is resisting the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md). This form of [takeover](../t/takeover.md) can be highly aggressive and involves various tactics to overcome the opposition from the target company's management and board of directors. It often leads to significant upheavals, both within the target company and in the [market](../m/market.md). Hostile takeovers are a clear demonstration of the aggressive strategies that can occur within [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md) and can have profound implications for the companies involved.

## Mechanisms of Hostile Takeover

### Tender Offer

A [tender offer](../t/tender_offer.md) involves the acquiring company making a direct appeal to the shareholders of the target company to sell their [shares](../s/shares.md) at a [premium](../p/premium.md) price. This [offer](../o/offer.md) usually comes with a set deadline, enticing shareholders with an urgent and financially attractive proposition while bypassing management's consent.

### Proxy Fight

In a [proxy fight](../p/proxy_fight.md), the acquiring company attempts to persuade the shareholders to use their [proxy](../p/proxy.md) votes to install new management that is more amenable to the [takeover](../t/takeover.md). This involves conducting a campaign to replace the [incumbent](../i/incumbent.md) board of directors with a slate of directors proposed by the acquiring company.

### Open Market Purchase

An [open market](../o/open_market.md) purchase involves the acquiring company buying [shares](../s/shares.md) of the target company directly from the [market](../m/market.md) anonymously. This can be a gradual process where the acquiring [firm](../f/firm.md) accumulates a significant stake in the target company without its knowledge, eventually gaining enough [shares](../s/shares.md) to exert significant influence or force a [takeover](../t/takeover.md).

## Defense Mechanisms by the Target Company

### Poison Pill

A [poison pill](../p/poison_pill.md) strategy is designed to make the target company less attractive to the potential acquirer. It can involve issuing new [shares](../s/shares.md) to existing shareholders, making the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) prohibitively expensive, or allowing shareholders to buy more [shares](../s/shares.md) at a [discount](../d/discount.md) if one [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) buys a large chunk, thereby diluting the [value](../v/value.md) of [shares](../s/shares.md) purchased by the acquirer.

### White Knight

A [white knight](../w/white_knight.md) defense strategy involves the target company seeking a more friendly or acceptable company to acquire them instead of the hostile bidder. The [white knight](../w/white_knight.md) is usually a company that the target company deems more beneficial for its future.

### Golden Parachute

Golden parachutes are agreements that [offer](../o/offer.md) [lucrative](../l/lucrative.md) benefits to top executives if the company is taken over and they are terminated as a result. This increases the cost of the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md), providing a disincentive to pursue the hostile [takeover](../t/takeover.md).

### Staggered Board

A staggered board means that only a portion of the board of directors is up for election each year. This makes it more difficult for the hostile bidder to [gain](../g/gain.md) control of the board quickly and alter its anti-[takeover](../t/takeover.md) strategies.

## Legal and Regulatory Framework

Hostile takeovers are bound by several legal and regulatory frameworks designed to protect the interests of the shareholders and ensure fair play. In many jurisdictions, these frameworks require full [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) of an acquirer's intentions and equitable treatment of shareholders.

### Williams Act

The [Williams Act](../w/williams_act.md) is part of U.S. federal law that seeks to provide fair and full [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) concerning acquisitions. The act requires any entity purchasing more than 5% of a company's [shares](../s/shares.md) to file several disclosures with the Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC). It also requires timely [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) of intentions and sources of [financing](../f/financing.md) for the [takeover](../t/takeover.md) [bid](../b/bid.md).

### Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act

This U.S. act requires companies considering large mergers or acquisitions to file pre-[merger](../m/merger.md) notifications to the Federal [Trade](../t/trade.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (FTC) and the Department of Justice. The goal is to identify and prevent [antitrust](../a/antitrust.md) issues that could arise from the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md).

## Famous Hostile Takeovers

### RJR Nabisco

The 1988 [takeover](../t/takeover.md) of RJR Nabisco stands as one of the most famous and dramatic hostile takeovers in corporate history. It was initiated by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. (KKR), which eventually won the bidding war with an [offer](../o/offer.md) of $25 billion. The event was chronicled in the book "Barbarians at the Gate," highlighting the massive debts and high stakes involved.

### AOL and Time Warner

While initially not hostile, the 2000 [takeover](../t/takeover.md) of Time Warner by AOL became hostile in nature as key stakeholders in Time Warner were resistant to the [takeover](../t/takeover.md). The [merger](../m/merger.md) is often cited as one of the worst in history, decimating [shareholder value](../s/shareholder_value.md) and resulting in substantial financial losses.

## Ethical Considerations

Hostile takeovers raise significant ethical considerations. They can dramatically affect employees, result in substantial redundancies, and lead to unsettling changes in [corporate culture](../c/corporate_culture.md). Additionally, while shareholders might benefit from [premium](../p/premium.md) offers, the long-term health and strategy of the target company can be jeopardized. 

### Impact on Employees

Employees of the target company often face [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) and instability during hostile takeovers. Job [security](../s/security.md) becomes a significant concern, and the aggressive nature of the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) can lead to high [turnover](../t/turnover.md) and loss of morale.

### Impact on Shareholders

Shareholders can benefit from [tender](../t/tender.md) offers that provide a [premium](../p/premium.md) over the [market price](../m/market_price.md). However, they must also consider the long-term impact on the [value](../v/value.md) of their investment, particularly if the [takeover](../t/takeover.md) leads to unsustainable levels of [debt](../d/debt.md) or poor strategic fits.

## Financial and Strategic Implications

Hostile takeovers can be financially intricate and strategically complex. They can involve significant [leverage](../l/leverage.md), where the acquiring company takes on substantial [debt](../d/debt.md) to [finance](../f/finance.md) the purchase. The success of the [takeover](../t/takeover.md) relies heavily on the strategic integration of the target company and the realization of synergistic benefits.

### Leveraged Buyouts (LBO)

Frequently, hostile takeovers are carried out through leveraged buyouts (LBOs), which involve acquiring a company using a significant amount of borrowed [money](../m/money.md). This method allows the acquiring company to make a large purchase without committing a lot of [capital](../c/capital.md) upfront. However, it also introduces substantial [financial risk](../f/financial_risk.md), particularly if the expected synergies and cost savings do not materialize.

### Post-Takeover Integration

Successful post-[takeover](../t/takeover.md) integration is critical but can be challenging. It involves aligning corporate cultures, merging processes and systems, and consolidating operations to achieve the anticipated efficiencies and strategic benefits. Poor integration can negate the gains from the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) and lead to [financial distress](../f/financial_distress.md).

## Case Studies

### Kraft Foods and Cadbury

In 2009, Kraft Foods launched a [hostile bid](../h/hostile_bid.md) for Cadbury, a British confectionery company. Despite strong resistance from Cadbury's management and widespread opposition in the UK, Kraft eventually succeeded with an [offer](../o/offer.md) of approximately $19 billion. The [takeover](../t/takeover.md) led to considerable scrutiny over Kraft's intentions and commitments, particularly regarding the preservation of Cadbury's heritage and jobs in the UK.

### Sanofi-Aventis and Genzyme

In 2010, French pharmaceutical company Sanofi-Aventis made a [hostile bid](../h/hostile_bid.md) to acquire American biotechnology [firm](../f/firm.md) Genzyme. Despite initial resistance from Genzyme, Sanofi persisted, eventually reaching a deal valued at $20.1 billion. The [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) was motivated by Sanofi's strategic goal to strengthen its position in the biotechnology sector.

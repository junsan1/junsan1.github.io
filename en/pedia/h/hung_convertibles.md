# Hung Convertibles

Hung convertibles, a term widely recognized within the [finance](../f/finance.md) and trading sectors, refer to convertible securities, often convertible bonds, that have not been fully sold or marketed by the underwriters. These securities remain with the [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) [firm](../f/firm.md) after the public [offering](../o/offering.md), indicating that the [demand](../d/demand.md) among investors was insufficient to fully absorb the issuance. This typically signals a lack of confidence or [interest](../i/interest.md) in the [underlying security](../u/underlying_security.md), the issuing entity, or the overall [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

## Basics of Convertible Securities

Convertible securities are a hybrid [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) that combines elements of both [debt](../d/debt.md) and [equity](../e/equity.md). Common forms include convertible bonds and convertible preferred [shares](../s/shares.md). These securities provide investors with the option, but not the obligation, to convert the [security](../s/security.md) into a predetermined number of [shares](../s/shares.md) of the issuing company’s [common stock](../c/common_stock.md). 

Convertible bonds, for instance, usually [offer](../o/offer.md) lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates compared to regular bonds due to the conversion feature, which provides the potential for investors to benefit from an increase in the stock price of the issuing company. The appeal lies in the combination of fixed-[income](../i/income.md) characteristics along with the potential for [equity](../e/equity.md)-like returns if the company's stock performs well.

## Process of Issuing Convertible Securities

When a company decides to [issue](../i/issue.md) convertible securities, it typically hires an [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) [firm](../f/firm.md) or a [syndicate](../s/syndicate.md) of firms to manage the [offering](../o/offering.md). The underwriters are tasked with pricing the [security](../s/security.md), [marketing](../m/marketing.md) it to potential investors, and ultimately selling the securities. 

### Underwriting and Potential Risks

The [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) process involves several steps:
1. **[Due Diligence](../d/due_diligence.md)**: The [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) team evaluates the issuing company’s [financial health](../f/financial_health.md), [business](../b/business.md) model, and growth prospects.
2. **Pricing**: Based on their evaluation, the underwriters determine a fair price and conversion terms for the convertible securities.
3. **[Marketing](../m/marketing.md)**: The securities are marketed to potential institutional and individual investors.
4. **[Sale](../s/sale.md)**: The securities are sold, usually during a public [offering](../o/offering.md) or a [private placement](../p/private_placement.md).

However, if there is insufficient [demand](../d/demand.md), not all the securities may be sold. The unsold portions, known as hung convertibles, represent the [risk](../r/risk.md) that the underwriters have taken in guaranteeing the [sale](../s/sale.md).

## Factors Leading to Hung Convertibles

There are several factors that can result in hung convertibles:

### Market Conditions

The broader [market](../m/market.md) environment has a significant impact. During periods of high [volatility](../v/volatility.md) or economic [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md), investors may be less willing to take on the added [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with convertible securities. This was notably seen during the financial crises, where [market](../m/market.md) participants sought safer, more stable investments.

### Company-Specific Issues

If the issuing company is facing particular challenges, such as declining [earnings](../e/earnings.md), high [debt](../d/debt.md) levels, or significant competitive pressures, investors may be wary of purchasing its convertible securities. For instance, if a company operating in a declining [industry](../i/industry.md) tries to [issue](../i/issue.md) convertibles, it might struggle to find buyers.

### Security-Specific Terms

The terms of the convertible [security](../s/security.md) itself can also influence [demand](../d/demand.md). Complex conversion terms, unfavorable [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, or unattractive conversion ratios can deter investors. If the features of the [security](../s/security.md) do not align well with [investor](../i/investor.md) expectations or [market](../m/market.md) standards, the [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) [firm](../f/firm.md) might have difficulty in selling the entire [issue](../i/issue.md).

## Consequences of Hung Convertibles

The existence of hung convertibles can have various implications:

### For the Issuing Company

A hung convertible [issue](../i/issue.md) can be detrimental to the issuing company's financial goals. It may limit the [capital](../c/capital.md) raised, impacting the company's ability to [finance](../f/finance.md) growth initiatives, pay down [debt](../d/debt.md), or pursue strategic objectives. This, in turn, can negatively affect the company's stock price and [investor](../i/investor.md) sentiment.

### For Underwriters

Hung convertibles pose a [financial risk](../f/financial_risk.md) to underwriters since they have to [hold](../h/hold.md) the unsold securities on their books. This ties up [capital](../c/capital.md) and can lead to potential losses if the [value](../v/value.md) of the convertible securities declines post-issuance. Furthermore, it can harm the [underwriter](../u/underwriter.md)’s reputation, affecting future [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) [business](../b/business.md).

## Case Studies

### Example 1: Tesla Convertible Bonds 2019

In March 2019, Tesla issued $1.84 billion in convertible bonds as part of its fundraising efforts. The [offering](../o/offering.md) was fully underwritten and did not result in hung convertibles, underscoring the strong [investor](../i/investor.md) [demand](../d/demand.md) for Tesla's securities at the time. This success was driven by Tesla's promising outlook and innovative [business](../b/business.md) model, reflective of how positive company-specific and [market](../m/market.md) factors can facilitate complete placement of convertible securities.

### Example 2: Hertz Global Holdings 2020

Contrast this with Hertz Global [Holdings](../h/holdings.md)' attempt to [issue](../i/issue.md) convertible securities in 2020 amid [financial distress](../f/financial_distress.md) and a looming [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md). The [market](../m/market.md) conditions and company-specific problems led to weak [investor](../i/investor.md) [interest](../i/interest.md), resulting in underwriters being left with unsold securities. This example highlights the higher likelihood of ending up with hung convertibles when [investor](../i/investor.md) confidence is low.

## Management of Hung Convertibles

### Strategies for Underwriters

To manage and mitigate the impacts of hung convertibles, underwriters may employ several strategies:
- **[Secondary Market](../s/secondary_market.md) Sales**: Attempting to sell the unsold securities in the [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md), albeit typically at a [discount](../d/discount.md).
- **Hedging**: Using [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) or other hedging mechanisms to [offset](../o/offset.md) potential losses.
- **Holding and Reselling**: Holding onto the convertibles until [market](../m/market.md) conditions improve, then reselling them at a more favorable time.

### Corporate Communication

Issuing companies must maintain transparent communication with investors and the [market](../m/market.md), explaining the rationale behind the [capital](../c/capital.md) raise and outlining how the proceeds [will](../w/will.md) drive future growth. Effective communication can sometimes alleviate [investor](../i/investor.md) concerns and improve the success rate of convertible [security](../s/security.md) offerings.

## Conclusion

Hung convertibles spotlight the inherent risks and complexities in the issuance of convertible securities. Understanding the dynamics of [investor](../i/investor.md) sentiment, [market](../m/market.md) conditions, company-specific factors, and [security](../s/security.md) terms is crucial for underwriters and issuing companies alike. Managing these factors effectively can facilitate successful convertible offerings and mitigate the [risk](../r/risk.md) of unsold securities burdening underwriters.

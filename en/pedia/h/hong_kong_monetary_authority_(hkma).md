# Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)

## Overview
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is the central banking institution of Hong Kong. Established in 1993 through the [merger](../m/merger.md) of the Office of the [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Fund](../f/fund.md) and the Office of the Commissioner of Banking, the HKMA plays a crucial role in maintaining monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong, as well as safeguarding the integrity of the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md). The HKMA operates with the mission of promoting Hong Kong as a leading international financial center.

## Key Functions
The HKMA encompasses several core functions that ensure monetary stability and effective functioning of the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md):

### 1. Currency Stability
HKMA's primary mandate involves maintaining [currency](../c/currency.md) stability. Under the linked [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) system, the Hong Kong Dollar (HKD) is pegged to the US Dollar (USD). The HKMA keeps the HKD [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) stable around 7.80 HKD to 1 USD by adjusting the Aggregate Balance, which is the balance of the banking system in the [Interbank market](../i/interbank_market.md). 

### 2. Banking Supervision
The HKMA supervises and monitors banks operating in Hong Kong to ensure their stability, soundness, and compliance with international banking standards. It follows rigorous prudential regulatory frameworks and conducts regular reviews and audits of banks' [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices.

### 3. Financial Infrastructure
HKMA is responsible for the development and enhancement of Hong Kong’s financial [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md). This includes [payment](../p/payment.md) systems, settlements systems, and [debt](../d/debt.md) issuance mechanisms that are essential for smooth financial transactions within the [market](../m/market.md).

### 4. Investment Management
The HKMA invests the [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Fund](../f/fund.md), which is the primary [reserve fund](../r/reserve_fund.md) backing the HKD, in various financial instruments to ensure its growth and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md). Investment strategies involve a diversified portfolio within managed [risk](../r/risk.md) parameters to maximize returns safely.

### 5. Market Development
The HKMA actively promotes the development of Hong Kong’s [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). It engages in international collaboration and ensures that regulatory standards align with global practices to reinforce Hong Kong as a premier financial center.

## Governance Structure
The HKMA operates under a clear governance structure that includes the following entities:

### Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC)
The EFAC advises the Financial Secretary on matters related to the [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Fund](../f/fund.md) and the stability of Hong Kong’s monetary system. 

### The Monetary Authority
The head of the HKMA is the Monetary Authority. The Monetary Authority is appointed by the Financial Secretary and oversees the operations and administrative functions of the HKMA.

### Other Committees
Several specialized committees operate under the HKMA, providing expert advice on various policy and operational issues within the Authority’s mandate.

## Monetary Policy
The HKMA's [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) framework is built around the management of the Linked [Exchange Rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) system. Through the Aggregate Balance, the HKMA effectively influences domestic [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, aligning them closely with US Federal Reserve's rates due to the USD peg. 

The [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) adjustment mechanism, known as the “[Discount](../d/discount.md) Window,” allows banks to borrow funds from the HKMA at a [discount rate](../d/discount_rate.md), providing a monetary tool to manage [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) in the banking system.

## Banking Policies and Regulations
The HKMA follows international banking standards, such as the [Basel Accords](../b/basel_accords.md), to develop and enforce policies focusing on [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), [capital](../c/capital.md) adequacy, and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md). Regulations encompass:

### Basel III Implementation
HKMA has fully implemented [Basel III](../b/basel_iii.md) standards to ensure that banks maintain adequate [capital](../c/capital.md) buffers, manage [leverage](../l/leverage.md), and are suitably [liquid](../l/liquid.md) to mitigate risks.

### Anti-Money Laundering (AML) 
HKMA enforces stringent AML regulations, ensuring banks implement [robust](../r/robust.md) mechanisms for preventing [money laundering](../m/money_laundering.md) and combating the [financing](../f/financing.md) of terrorism.

### Consumer Protection
The HKMA develops frameworks to protect consumer interests, focusing on [transparency](../t/transparency.md), fair treatment, and [recourse](../r/recourse.md) mechanisms in the banking sector.

## Financial Stability Surveillance
The HKMA regularly monitors [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md), stress tests banks, and assesses potential financial risks to maintain financial stability. It publishes various reports and analyses:

### Annual and Quarterly Reports
These publications provide insights into Hong Kong’s economic and financial conditions, [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) implementation, and banking [sector performance](../s/sector_performance.md).

### Financial Stability Report
The Financial Stability Report evaluates systemic risks and the resilience of the [financial system](../f/financial_system.md), providing a thorough analysis of macroeconomic and sectoral vulnerabilities.

## Financial Infrastructure Development
Key initiatives include:

### Faster Payment System (FPS)
Launched to facilitate real-time [payment](../p/payment.md) and transfer services, the FPS supports cross-[bank](../b/bank.md) and electronic payments efficiently and securely.

### Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU)
The CMU provides a safe and efficient platform for the issuance, [clearing](../c/clearing.md), and settlement of [debt](../d/debt.md) securities in Hong Kong.

### Digital Currency Research
HKMA actively explores Central [Bank](../b/bank.md) Digital Currencies (CBDC) and has collaborated with other central banks, such as the People’s [Bank](../b/bank.md) of China, on the development of digital Yuan.

## Market Development Efforts
The HKMA promotes Hong Kong’s status as an international financial hub by:

### RMB Internationalization
HKMA has taken various steps to develop Hong Kong as an [offshore](../o/offshore.md) Renminbi (RMB) center, supporting RMB-denominated [trade](../t/trade.md) settlement and investment.

### Green Finance
The HKMA encourages the development of green [finance](../f/finance.md), including the issuance of [green bonds](../g/green_bonds.md) and the implementation of green investment principles to foster sustainable financial practices.

## International Collaboration

### Bank for International Settlements (BIS)

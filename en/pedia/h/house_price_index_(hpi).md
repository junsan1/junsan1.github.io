# House Price Index (HPI)

The House Price [Index](../i/index.md) (HPI) is a crucial [economic indicator](../e/economic_indicator.md) that provides insights into the housing [market](../m/market.md)'s performance by measuring the changes in single-family [home](../h/home.md) prices over time. It is used by a [range](../r/range.md) of stakeholders, including [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) professionals, policymakers, investors, and economists, to assess the health of the housing [market](../m/market.md), manage investments, and formulate housing-related policies. This detailed overview [will](../w/will.md) cover the definition, importance, calculation, and applications of the HPI, as well as notable companies and tools related to it.

## Definition

The House Price [Index](../i/index.md) (HPI) is a broad measure of the movement of single-family house prices. It is computed using data on repeat sales of houses that have undergone at least two transactions. By examining repeat sales, the HPI effectively tracks increases or decreases in house prices over specific periods, providing a [robust](../r/robust.md) gauge of the housing [market](../m/market.md)'s trends.

Various organizations, including the Federal Housing [Finance](../f/finance.md) Agency (FHFA) in the United States, the Office for National [Statistics](../s/statistics.md) (ONS) in the United Kingdom, and other national statistical agencies, produce their versions of the HPI.

## Importance of HPI

### Economic Indicator
The HPI is a key [economic indicator](../e/economic_indicator.md) that reflects the health of the housing [market](../m/market.md), a significant component of the overall [economy](../e/economy.md). A rising HPI suggests strong [demand](../d/demand.md) for housing, which may signal [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md), while a falling HPI might indicate economic troubles or a cooling housing [market](../m/market.md).

### Policy Formulation
Governments and central banks use the HPI to shape economic policy. For example, a rapidly rising HPI may prompt authorities to consider measures to prevent housing [bubbles](../b/bubble.md), such as tightening lending standards or adjusting [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

### Investment Decisions
[Real estate](../r/real_estate.md) investors use the HPI to gauge the profitability and [risk](../r/risk.md) of housing investments. A [robust](../r/robust.md) HPI might indicate a good time to invest in [real estate](../r/real_estate.md), whereas a declining HPI may suggest caution.

### Mortgage Industry
Lenders and financial institutions use the HPI to assess risks associated with [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) lending. An increasing HPI can decrease the likelihood of [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) defaults, impacting lending strategies and [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.

## Calculation

### Methodologies

#### FHFA HPI
The Federal Housing [Finance](../f/finance.md) Agency (FHFA) computes the HPI using a [weighted](../w/weighted.md) repeat sales (WRS) methodology. This approach involves analyzing the prices of homes that have been sold [multiple](../m/multiple.md) times, allowing for the isolation of price changes over specific periods while controlling for property-specific characteristics.

FHFA collects data from Fannie Mae and [Freddie Mac](../f/freddie_mac.md), covering conventional, conforming loans. This dataset allows the HPI to provide a comprehensive view of the U.S. housing [market](../m/market.md).

#### Case-Shiller HPI
Another prominent HPI, the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller [Home](../h/home.md) Price Indices, uses a similar repeat-sales method. It includes a broader dataset from various sources, including public records and [loan](../l/loan.md) data, and offers detailed regional and metropolitan area indices.

### Index Formats
HPIs are generally presented in various formats:
- **Monthly, Quarterly, and Annual Indices**: These indices provide short-term and long-term perspectives on house price trends.
- **Seasonally Adjusted Indices**: Adjustments account for seasonal fluctuations, [offering](../o/offering.md) a clearer view of [underlying](../u/underlying.md) trends.
- **Non-Seasonally Adjusted Indices**: These provide raw data without adjustments for seasonal effects.

## Applications

### Real Estate Market Analysis
Professionals in the [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) [industry](../i/industry.md) use the HPI for [market](../m/market.md) analysis, helping them understand price trends, compare regional markets, and make informed decisions about buying, selling, and developing properties.

### Risk Management
Financial institutions and insurers utilize the HPI to manage risks. By analyzing HPI trends, they can forecast potential defaults and losses, adjust [credit](../c/credit.md) requirements, and plan for [market](../m/market.md) contingencies.

### Economic Research
Economists and researchers use the HPI to study macroeconomic conditions and housing [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md). Insights gained from HPI analysis contribute to broader economic studies and policy reviews.

### Public Awareness
The HPI serves as a tool for educating the public about housing [market](../m/market.md) conditions. Media outlets and [industry](../i/industry.md) reports often cite HPI figures to inform people about [market](../m/market.md) trends, helping consumers make better-informed housing decisions.

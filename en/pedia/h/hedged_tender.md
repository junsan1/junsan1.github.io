# Hedged Tender

In the world of [finance](../f/finance.md) and trading, a "Hedged [Tender](../t/tender.md)" is a sophisticated strategy used by traders and investors to manage [risk](../r/risk.md) and potentially enhance returns during [tender](../t/tender.md) offers. A [tender offer](../t/tender_offer.md) is a [bid](../b/bid.md) to purchase some or all of shareholders' [shares](../s/shares.md) in a [corporation](../c/corporation.md). The “hedged” in hedged [tender](../t/tender.md) refers to the protective measures taken to reduce or mitigate [risk](../r/risk.md).

## Objectives and Mechanics

The core objective of a hedged [tender](../t/tender.md) strategy is to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) the [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with owning a [security](../s/security.md) that is subject to a [tender offer](../t/tender_offer.md). This involves offsetting potential losses through other financial instruments.

### Key Components:

1. **[Tender Offer](../t/tender_offer.md)**:
    - A [tender offer](../t/tender_offer.md) is an [offer](../o/offer.md) to purchase [shares](../s/shares.md) from shareholders, usually at a [premium](../p/premium.md) over the [market price](../m/market_price.md), for a specified time.
    - It can be hostile (without board approval) or friendly (with board approval).
    - Examples include mergers, acquisitions, and buybacks.

2. **Hedging**:
    - Hedging involves taking an opposite position in a related [security](../s/security.md) to mitigate [risk](../r/risk.md).
    - Common hedges include [options](../o/options.md) and [futures](../f/futures.md).

### Steps in a Hedged Tender:

1. **Evaluating the [Offer](../o/offer.md)**:
    - Assess the attractiveness of the [tender offer](../t/tender_offer.md).
    - Analyze the [premium](../p/premium.md) offered over the current [market price](../m/market_price.md).

2. **Building a [Hedge](../h/hedge.md)**:
    - Once deciding to participate, build a protective [hedge](../h/hedge.md).
    - Example: Use [options](../o/options.md) such as buying puts to protect against [downside risk](../d/downside_risk.md).

3. **Tendering [Shares](../s/shares.md)**:
    - Submit the [shares](../s/shares.md) to the [tender offer](../t/tender_offer.md).
    - Simultaneously maintain the [hedge](../h/hedge.md).

4. **Adjusting the [Hedge](../h/hedge.md)**:
    - Modify the [hedge](../h/hedge.md) as needed based on [market](../m/market.md) movement or changes in the [offer](../o/offer.md).

## Examples and Case Studies

### Case Study 1: XYZ Corporation
XYZ [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) announces a [tender offer](../t/tender_offer.md) at a 20% [premium](../p/premium.md) above its current trading price. An [investor](../i/investor.md) with 1,000 [shares](../s/shares.md) of XYZ decides to use a hedged [tender](../t/tender.md) strategy.

1. **Buying Puts**: 
     - They purchase 10 [put option](../p/put.md) contracts (equivalent to 1,000 [shares](../s/shares.md)) with a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) close to the current trading price to protect against a possible decline in stock [value](../v/value.md).
    
2. **Tendering [Shares](../s/shares.md)**:
    - The [investor](../i/investor.md) submits their 1,000 [shares](../s/shares.md) to the [tender offer](../t/tender_offer.md).

3. **Outcome**:
    - If the [tender offer](../t/tender_offer.md) is successful, the [shares](../s/shares.md) are sold at the [premium](../p/premium.md), and the puts expire worthless.
    - If not, the puts [will](../w/will.md) limit the loss on the unsold [shares](../s/shares.md).

### Case Study 2: ABC Inc.
ABC Inc. faces a hostile [tender offer](../t/tender_offer.md). The stock is highly volatile. An [institutional investor](../i/institutional_investor.md) with significant [holdings](../h/holdings.md) in ABC decides to use a different hedging approach:

1. **Selling Call [Options](../o/options.md)**:
    - They sell call [options](../o/options.md) at a [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) higher than the [tender offer](../t/tender_offer.md) price, generating [premium](../p/premium.md) [income](../i/income.md) to [offset](../o/offset.md) potential declines.

2. **Tendering a Portion**:
    - The institution tenders part of its [holdings](../h/holdings.md), keeping the rest hedged with the sold calls.

3. **Outcome**:
    - If the [offer](../o/offer.md) succeeds partially, the institute gains from the [premium](../p/premium.md) and the [shares](../s/shares.md) sold.
    - If the [offer](../o/offer.md) fails, the [premium](../p/premium.md) from sold calls acts as a cushion against price drop.

## Role of Derivatives in Hedged Tenders

[Derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), particularly [options](../o/options.md), play a crucial role in hedged tenders. They provide flexibility and [leverage](../l/leverage.md).

### Common Derivative Instruments:

1. **[Options](../o/options.md)**:
    - **Puts**: Right to sell at a specific price.
    - **Calls**: Obligated to sell at a specific price.

2. **[Futures](../f/futures.md)**:
    - Contracts to buy/sell at a future date at an agreed price.

### Example:

An [investor](../i/investor.md) anticipates a [tender offer](../t/tender_offer.md) but is unsure of the outcome. They use a combination of call and [put options](../p/put_options.md) ([straddle](../s/straddle.md) strategy) to [hedge](../h/hedge.md). They buy both a call and a put at the same [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) and expiration. This ensures protection regardless of the [tender offer](../t/tender_offer.md) result.

## Benefits and Risks

### Benefits:

1. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**:
    - Limits potential losses.
    - Provides [insurance](../i/insurance.md) against adverse [market](../m/market.md) movements.

2. **Potential for Enhanced Returns**:
    - When used correctly, may enhance profitability.

### Risks:

1. **Cost of Hedging**:
    - [Derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) may reduce net gains due to associated costs (premiums, [transaction fees](../t/transaction_fees.md)).

2. **Complexity**:
    - Requires understanding of both the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) stock and the [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) [market](../m/market.md).

3. **[Market Risk](../m/market_risk.md)**:
    - Despite hedging, some risks may remain unmitigated.

## Real-World Applications

### Hedge Funds
[Hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds often employ hedged [tender](../t/tender.md) strategies as part of their broader [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md). Their use of sophisticated models and [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) allows them to participate in [tender](../t/tender.md) offers while managing [risk](../r/risk.md) efficiently.

### Corporate Buybacks
Corporations conducting buybacks may use hedged tenders to manage the impact on their stock price, ensuring that [share repurchase](../s/share_repurchase.md) activities do not unduly affect [market](../m/market.md) stability.

## Conclusion

Hedged [tender](../t/tender.md) strategies are a vital tool in the landscape of modern trading and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md). By leveraging [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) and other financial instruments, traders and investors can navigate the complexities of [tender](../t/tender.md) offers more effectively. However, mastering such strategies requires a deep understanding of both the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) securities and the associated hedging tools. Used judiciously, hedged tenders can turn potentially volatile situations into opportunities for [profit](../p/profit.md) and [risk](../r/risk.md) mitigation.

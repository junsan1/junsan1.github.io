# Homemade Leverage

Homemade [leverage](../l/leverage.md) is a [finance](../f/finance.md) concept that refers to the ability of individual investors to modify the [leverage](../l/leverage.md) of their own portfolio independently of the [leverage](../l/leverage.md) chosen by the [firm](../f/firm.md) in which they have invested. The term is rooted in the Modigliani-Miller theorem, which posits that in a perfect [market](../m/market.md), the [value](../v/value.md) of a [firm](../f/firm.md) is unaffected by its [capital structure](../c/capital_structure.md). Therefore, individual investors can replicate the effects of corporate [leverage](../l/leverage.md) through personal borrowing or lending.

## Introduction

In traditional [finance](../f/finance.md), [leverage](../l/leverage.md) is often discussed in the context of companies that decide to [finance](../f/finance.md) their activities using a mix of [debt](../d/debt.md) and [equity](../e/equity.md). When a company issues [debt](../d/debt.md), it increases its [leverage](../l/leverage.md), hoping to amplify its returns on [equity](../e/equity.md) through the use of borrowed funds. However, not all investors may agree with the [leverage](../l/leverage.md) choices made by a company, leading to a misalignment of investment goals. Homemade [leverage](../l/leverage.md) allows these investors to adjust their [leverage](../l/leverage.md) independently of corporate decisions.

## Modigliani-Miller Theorem

The foundation for the concept of homemade [leverage](../l/leverage.md) can be traced back to the Modigliani-Miller theorem, formulated by Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller in 1958. One of the key propositions of the theorem states that in a world without [taxes](../t/taxes.md), [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) costs, and [asymmetric information](../a/asymmetric_information.md), the [value](../v/value.md) of a [firm](../f/firm.md) is unaffected by its [capital structure](../c/capital_structure.md). In other words, the way a [firm](../f/firm.md) finances itself—whether through [debt](../d/debt.md) or [equity](../e/equity.md)—does not impact its overall [value](../v/value.md).

This theorem has profound implications, especially for the concept of homemade [leverage](../l/leverage.md). If the [value](../v/value.md) of a company is indeed indifferent to its [capital structure](../c/capital_structure.md) in a perfect [market](../m/market.md), individual investors can replicate the same [leverage](../l/leverage.md) by borrowing on their own account. Consequently, this nullifies the need for firms to adjust their financial [leverage](../l/leverage.md) to suit individual [investor](../i/investor.md) preferences, as those investors can achieve their desired [leverage](../l/leverage.md) by themselves.

## How Homemade Leverage Works

### Borrowing and Lending

To apply homemade [leverage](../l/leverage.md), an [investor](../i/investor.md) can either borrow [money](../m/money.md) to increase their exposure to an investment or lend [money](../m/money.md) to decrease it.

1. **Increasing Exposure Through Borrowing**: Suppose an [investor](../i/investor.md) has $100,000 worth of [equity](../e/equity.md) but wants to increase their [leverage](../l/leverage.md). They can borrow an additional $50,000 at a certain [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) and invest the entire $150,000. This increases their exposure to the investment and amplifies potential returns, though it also increases [risk](../r/risk.md).

2. **Decreasing Exposure Through Lending**: Conversely, if an [investor](../i/investor.md) holds $100,000 in a leveraged [firm](../f/firm.md) but desires less exposure to [risk](../r/risk.md), they can lend a portion of their [holdings](../h/holdings.md) at a given [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md). For instance, lending $30,000 would adjust their effective investment to $70,000, reducing their exposure to the risky [asset](../a/asset.md).

### Portfolio Adjustment

Investors can use homemade [leverage](../l/leverage.md) to match their [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) and investment goals. This is particularly useful in markets where firms have varying levels of [debt](../d/debt.md) in their [capital](../c/capital.md) structures. By adjusting their personal [leverage](../l/leverage.md), investors can create a customized portfolio that reflects their [risk](../r/risk.md) appetite.

## Practical Applications

### Leveraged ETFs

[Exchange](../e/exchange.md)-Traded Funds (ETFs) often provide leveraged [options](../o/options.md) to investors. However, these financial products come with management fees and may not align perfectly with an individual's [investment horizon](../i/investment_horizon.md) or [risk](../r/risk.md) preference. Homemade [leverage](../l/leverage.md) allows investors to avoid these fees and have more control over their investment strategies.

### Real Estate Investment

Investors in [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) often use mortgages to increase [leverage](../l/leverage.md). However, individuals may find it advantageous to customize their [leverage](../l/leverage.md) using personal loans or lines of [credit](../c/credit.md), especially if [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) rates or terms are unfavorable. Homemade [leverage](../l/leverage.md) facilitates more flexible [financing](../f/financing.md) [options](../o/options.md).

### Stock Market Investments

1. **[Margin](../m/margin.md) Buying**: Investors can use [margin](../m/margin.md) accounts to borrow against their brokerage accounts to purchase more [stocks](../s/stock.md). This kind of [leverage](../l/leverage.md) amplifies both gains and losses and can be a form of homemade [leverage](../l/leverage.md).

2. **[Options](../o/options.md) and [Derivatives](../d/derivatives.md)**: Using [options](../o/options.md) and other [derivative](../d/derivative.md) instruments, investors can achieve leveraged positions. For example, purchasing call [options](../o/options.md) allows investors to control a larger number of [shares](../s/shares.md) with a relatively small investment, thus increasing [leverage](../l/leverage.md).

## Benefits and Risks

### Benefits

1. **Customization**: Homemade [leverage](../l/leverage.md) allows investors to tailor their [risk](../r/risk.md) and [return](../r/return.md) profiles to match their personal financial goals.
2. **Cost Savings**: By managing [leverage](../l/leverage.md) independently, investors can potentially save on management fees that come with leveraged investment products.
3. **Flexibility**: Investors can adjust their [leverage](../l/leverage.md) rapidly in response to [market](../m/market.md) conditions or changes in their personal financial situations.

### Risks

1. **[Interest](../i/interest.md) Costs**: Borrowing to increase [leverage](../l/leverage.md) comes with [interest](../i/interest.md) costs, which can erode returns, especially in a rising [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) environment.
2. **Amplified Losses**: While [leverage](../l/leverage.md) can amplify gains, it also magnifies losses. In volatile markets, this can result in significant [financial risk](../f/financial_risk.md).
3. **[Margin](../m/margin.md) Calls**: For those using [margin](../m/margin.md) accounts, sudden [market](../m/market.md) downturns can lead to [margin](../m/margin.md) calls, requiring investors to [deposit](../d/deposit.md) additional funds or sell off assets, potentially at a loss.

## Comparison with Corporate Leverage

In a corporate context, [leverage](../l/leverage.md) decisions are typically made at the executive level, taking into account the [firm](../f/firm.md)'s overall strategy, [industry](../i/industry.md) conditions, and [market](../m/market.md) environment. These decisions have widespread implications for all shareholders. 

### Pros of Corporate Leverage

1. **Tax Shields**: [Interest](../i/interest.md) payments on corporate [debt](../d/debt.md) are often tax-deductible, providing firms with a significant tax advantage.
2. **Professional Management**: Corporate [leverage](../l/leverage.md) decisions are made by professional managers, potentially leading to better-informed and systematic approaches to [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Cons of Corporate Leverage

1. **[Agency Costs](../a/agency_costs.md)**: The interests of managers and shareholders may not always align, leading to potential conflicts of [interest](../i/interest.md).
2. **Fixed Decisions**: Individual investors have little to no influence over the [leverage](../l/leverage.md) decisions made by a company, potentially leading to misaligned [risk](../r/risk.md) preferences.

## Real-World Examples

Several prominent investors have used homemade [leverage](../l/leverage.md) to their advantage. 

### George Soros

[George Soros](../g/george_soros.md), through his Quantum [Fund](../f/fund.md), is known for using significant [leverage](../l/leverage.md) to achieve high returns. By borrowing substantial amounts to [fund](../f/fund.md) his investments, Soros effectively used homemade [leverage](../l/leverage.md) on an institutional scale.

### Warren Buffett

Warren Buffett, through [Berkshire Hathaway](../b/berkshire_hathaway.md), has used homemade [leverage](../l/leverage.md) in a more subtle manner. By [investing](../i/investing.md) in [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies and using the '[float](../f/float.md)'—premiums collected from policyholders but not yet paid out—Buffett effectively invested borrowed [money](../m/money.md), creating leveraged returns.

## Regulatory Considerations

[Leverage](../l/leverage.md), whether corporate or homemade, is subject to regulatory scrutiny to protect investors and maintain [market](../m/market.md) stability.

### Margin Requirements

Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC) and Financial [Industry](../i/industry.md) Regulatory Authority (FINRA) regulations in the United States set minimum [margin](../m/margin.md) requirements to limit the amount borrowed against securities. 

1. **[Initial Margin](../i/initial_margin.md)**: The minimum amount of [equity](../e/equity.md) an [investor](../i/investor.md) must contribute when [buying on margin](../b/buying_on_margin.md), typically set at 50%.
2. **[Maintenance Margin](../m/maintenance_margin.md)**: The minimum [equity](../e/equity.md) an [investor](../i/investor.md) must maintain in their [margin account](../m/margin_account.md), usually around 25%.

### Disclosure Requirements

Investors and firms must disclose their leveraged positions to ensure [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and protect [market](../m/market.md) integrity. For institutional investors, this includes regular reporting to regulatory bodies, while individual investors must comply with their brokerage's [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) requirements.

## Conclusion

Homemade [leverage](../l/leverage.md) provides individual investors with a powerful tool to tailor their investment portfolios to better meet their personal financial goals and [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md). Rooted in the Modigliani-Miller theorem, it offers a way to circumvent the limitations imposed by corporate [leverage](../l/leverage.md) decisions. However, homemade [leverage](../l/leverage.md) comes with significant risks, particularly in volatile markets, and requires careful management and regulatory compliance. By understanding and employing homemade [leverage](../l/leverage.md) wisely, investors can potentially enhance their returns and achieve a more suitable [risk](../r/risk.md)-[return](../r/return.md) profile.

# Hedge Fund Manager

A [hedge](../h/hedge.md) [fund manager](../f/fund_manager.md) is a financial professional responsible for managing a [hedge fund](../h/hedge_fund.md), which is a pooled [investment vehicle](../i/investment_vehicle.md) that employs different strategies to earn active returns for its investors. These strategies can involve leveraging, short-selling, [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), and [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) trading to maximize returns and [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against [risk](../r/risk.md). [Hedge fund](../h/hedge_fund.md) managers are not only responsible for making investment decisions but also for managing the overall strategy, [risk](../r/risk.md), operations, and often the [marketing](../m/marketing.md) and [investor relations](../i/investor_relations.md) associated with the [fund](../f/fund.md).

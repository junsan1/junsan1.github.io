# Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP)

The Harmonized [Index](../i/index.md) of Consumer Prices (HICP) is a specially designed measure of consumer price [inflation](../i/inflation.md) that is comparable across EU Member States. Developed and maintained by Eurostat, it allows economists, policymakers, and financial analysts to measure and compare the rate of [inflation](../i/inflation.md) among EU countries while providing a consistent [basis](../b/basis.md) for [inflation](../i/inflation.md) targeting and economic policy formulation.

## Definition and Purpose

HICP measures the changes over time in the prices of [consumer goods](../c/consumer_goods.md) and services acquired, used, or paid for by households. It is designed to provide a harmonized measure of [inflation](../i/inflation.md) helping to create stable economic policies and is crucial in the assessment of [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) conditions. In the [European Union](../e/european_union_(eu).md) context, HICP became essential for the European Central [Bank](../b/bank.md) (ECB) in determining price stability and guiding [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md).

## Calculation Methodology

### Scope and Coverage

The HICP takes into account a broad spectrum of goods and services, categorized as:
- Food and non-alcoholic beverages
- Alcoholic beverages, tobacco, and narcotics
- Clothing and footwear
- Housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuels
- Furnishings, household equipment, and routine household maintenance
- Health
- Transport
- Communication
- Recreation and culture
- Education
- Restaurants and hotels
- Miscellaneous goods and services

### Weighting Scheme

HICP is constructed using a Laspeyres-type [index](../i/index.md), which uses weights derived from the Household [Budget](../b/budget.md) Surveys reflecting consumption patterns of the target population. These weights are periodically updated to ensure they reflect the most current and relevant spending behaviors. Concretely, each category's price change is [weighted](../w/weighted.md) by its importance in the total consumption expenditure of households.

### Data Collection

Data for HICP is collected through diverse channels:
- Retailers and service providers
- Online price monitoring
- Consumer reports and surveys
This data collection is executed uniformly across all EU Member States to ensure coherence.

### Treatment of Seasonal Items and Imputation

Seasonal items, such as certain foodstuffs and clothing products, are treated with specific methodologies to account for regular price fluctuations. Missing prices can be imputed using prices of similar items or applying historical averages during unavailable periods.

## Importance and Uses

### Policy Formulation

The most prominent application of the HICP is in the [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) formulation of the European Central [Bank](../b/bank.md) (ECB). The ECB targets an [inflation](../i/inflation.md) rate “below, but close to 2%” over the medium term, using HICP as the official measure. Ensuring price stability helps to foster sustainable [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) and employment.

### Economic Assessment and Comparison

HICP facilitates meaningful cross-country economic comparisons within the EU. By harmonizing the measure of consumer [inflation](../i/inflation.md), it allows for assessing economic performance and coordinating fiscal policies among member states. 

### Financial Markets

Traders, investors, and financial analysts monitor HICP as an [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of [underlying](../u/underlying.md) price pressures in the [economy](../e/economy.md). Changes in the HICP could signal shifts in [monetary policy](../m/monetary_policy.md) stance by the ECB, influencing [bond](../b/bond.md) markets, [equity](../e/equity.md) valuations, and [currency](../c/currency.md) movements.

## Differences with National CPI

While HICP and National Consumer Price Indices (CPI) may seem similar, they have distinct differences:
- **Geographical Coverage**: National CPIs often include indices for various subregions, while HICP is aggregated at the country level for EU comparability.
- **Population Coverage**: HICP considers all expenditure within the country's economic territory by resident and non-resident households, whereas national CPIs might exclude some groups.
- **Weighting and [Scope](../s/scope.md)**: The weight structures are periodically harmonized across EU to maintain comparative consistency.

## Harmonization Efforts and Evolution

HICP has evolved significantly since its inception. Initially launched in 1997, it has undergone numerous methodological refinements and expansions:
- **Integration of Owner-Occupied Housing**: Efforts to integrate this sector are ongoing, recognizing the substantial role housing costs play in [household expenses](../h/household_expenses.md).
- **Environmental and Quality Adjustments**: Adjustments are increasingly made to correct for changes in the quality of goods and services as well as factoring in environmentally sustainable consumption behaviors.

## Data Accessibility and Transparency

Eurostat ensures that HICP data is readily accessible to the public, promoting [transparency](../t/transparency.md). The data, methodologies, and explanations are thoroughly documented and frequently updated on Eurostat’s official website: [Eurostat HICP Data](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/hicp).

## Conclusion

The Harmonized [Index](../i/index.md) of Consumer Prices (HICP) is a vital statistical [indicator](../i/indicator.md) that supports economic policymaking, inter-country comparisons, and financial [market](../m/market.md) analysis within the [European Union](../e/european_union_(eu).md). By providing a consistent and harmonized measure of consumer price [inflation](../i/inflation.md), it enables more effective and coordinated economic strategies, hence supporting the stability and growth of the broader European [economy](../e/economy.md).

# Historical Cost

Historical cost is an [accounting](../a/accounting.md) principle that measures the [value](../v/value.md) of an [asset](../a/asset.md) based on its original purchase cost. This principle contrasts with other [valuation](../v/valuation.md) methods, such as current [market value](../m/market_value.md) or [replacement cost](../r/replacement_cost.md), and is a fundamental concept in traditional [financial accounting](../f/financial_accounting.md) and reporting. The historical cost method provides a reliable and objective means of reporting assets, as it records the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) cost of an [asset](../a/asset.md) at the time of purchase and does not account for changes in the [market value](../m/market_value.md) over time.

## Definition and Concept
The historical cost principle is used to assign a monetary [value](../v/value.md) to assets recorded in the [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) of a company. Under this principle, the [value](../v/value.md) of an [asset](../a/asset.md) is based on its original purchase price, plus any costs incurred to bring the [asset](../a/asset.md) to its current condition and location for use. This method of [asset valuation](../a/asset_valuation.md) is praised for its simplicity and objectivity, as it relies on verifiable [transaction](../t/transaction.md) documentation such as [receipts](../r/receipt.md), contracts, and invoices.

### Advantages of Historical Cost
1. **Objectivity**: Historical cost is based on actual transactions that can be verified, providing a factual and unbiased record. This objectivity reinforces [trust](../t/trust.md) and reliability in financial reporting.
2. **Simplicity**: By recording assets at their purchase price, historical [cost accounting](../c/cost_accounting.md) avoids the complexities involved in determining current [market](../m/market.md) values, which can be subjective and fluctuate over time.
3. **Consistency**: Historical cost provides a stable [basis](../b/basis.md) for valuing assets, allowing for consistent financial reporting over time. This consistency aids in comparability between different reporting periods and with other companies using the same method.

### Disadvantages of Historical Cost
1. **Relevance**: Critics argue that historical cost may not reflect the current [value](../v/value.md) of an [asset](../a/asset.md), particularly in times of [inflation](../i/inflation.md) or [market](../m/market.md) [volatility](../v/volatility.md). This can lead to outdated or misleading information in the [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md).
2. **Lack of [Fair Value](../f/fair_value.md)**: Historical cost does not account for changes in the [market value](../m/market_value.md) of assets, which may not represent their [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) in the current economic environment.
3. **Impaired Comparability**: When comparing [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) of companies that use different [valuation](../v/valuation.md) methods, historical cost may lead to inconsistencies and impair comparability.

## Application in Accounting
The historical cost principle is widely used in [financial accounting](../f/financial_accounting.md) for reporting tangible and intangible assets. The application of this principle involves recording assets on the [balance sheet](../b/balance_sheet.md) at their initial purchase price. Over time, [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) or amortization is applied to these assets to reflect their usage and expected decline in [value](../v/value.md).

### Tangible Assets
For [tangible assets](../t/tangible_asset.md) such as property, plant, and equipment, historical cost includes the purchase price, transportation costs, installation fees, and any other expenses directly attributable to bringing the [asset](../a/asset.md) into working condition for its intended use. [Depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) is then systematically allocated over the [asset](../a/asset.md)’s [useful life](../u/useful_life.md).

### Intangible Assets
Historical cost is also applied to intangible assets, such as patents, trademarks, and [goodwill](../g/goodwill.md). The initial cost includes the purchase price and any legal or registration fees. Amortization of intangible assets is performed over their estimated [useful life](../u/useful_life.md) unless they are considered to have an indefinite lifespan, in which case they are subject to [impairment](../i/impairment.md) testing.

## Comparison with Fair Value Accounting
[Fair value](../f/fair_value.md) [accounting](../a/accounting.md) is an alternative approach to historical cost that measures assets and liabilities at their current [market value](../m/market_value.md). This method aims to provide a more accurate and dynamic representation of a company's financial position by reflecting current [market](../m/market.md) conditions. The main differences between historical cost and [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) [accounting](../a/accounting.md) are:

1. **[Valuation](../v/valuation.md) [Basis](../b/basis.md)**: Historical cost is based on the original purchase price, whereas [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) is based on the current [market price](../m/market_price.md) of an [asset](../a/asset.md) or [liability](../l/liability.md).
2. **Measurement Frequency**: Historical cost remains constant (except for [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) or amortization), while [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) is updated periodically to reflect [market](../m/market.md) changes.
3. **Impact on [Financial Statements](../f/financial_statements.md)**: [Fair value](../f/fair_value.md) [accounting](../a/accounting.md) can lead to more volatile [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) due to [market](../m/market.md) fluctuations, whereas historical cost provides more stable and consistent values.

### Advantages of Fair Value Accounting
1. **Relevance**: [Fair value](../f/fair_value.md) provides timely and relevant information that better reflects an [asset](../a/asset.md)’s current worth.
2. **[Market](../m/market.md) Sensitivity**: It captures the impact of [market](../m/market.md) changes and [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md), providing a more accurate picture of a company's [financial health](../f/financial_health.md).
3. **Enhanced Comparability**: [Fair value](../f/fair_value.md) facilitates more meaningful comparisons between companies and across different time periods.

### Disadvantages of Fair Value Accounting
1. **Subjectivity**: Determining the [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) of assets can involve significant [judgment](../j/judgment.md) and estimation, leading to potential biases and inconsistencies.
2. **[Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: [Financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md) based on [fair value](../f/fair_value.md) can be more volatile, reflecting short-term [market](../m/market.md) fluctuations and potentially impacting perceived stability.
3. **Measurement Challenges**: Inactive markets or non-marketable assets can pose difficulties in reliably determining [fair value](../f/fair_value.md).

## Regulatory Perspective
Historical [cost accounting](../c/cost_accounting.md) is mandated by several [accounting](../a/accounting.md) standards and regulatory bodies, including the Generally Accepted [Accounting Principles](../a/accounting_principles.md) (GAAP) in the United States and the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). These frameworks specify guidelines for measuring and reporting historical cost, ensuring uniformity and comparability in [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md).

### GAAP
Under GAAP, the historical cost principle is a fundamental concept for [asset valuation](../a/asset_valuation.md). Companies are required to record assets at their historical cost and apply systematic [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) or amortization based on the [asset](../a/asset.md)’s [useful life](../u/useful_life.md).

### IFRS
While IFRS allows for more flexibility in the choice of [valuation](../v/valuation.md) methods, historical cost remains a widely accepted practice. IFRS provides guidelines for initial recognition and subsequent measurement of assets, encouraging consistency and [transparency](../t/transparency.md) in financial reporting.

## Real-World Examples
### Case Study: Coca-Cola
The Coca-Cola Company (https://www.coca-colacompany.com) provides an example of a company that uses historical [cost accounting](../c/cost_accounting.md) for its financial reporting. Coca-Cola records its tangible and intangible assets at their original purchase price and applies systematic [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) and amortization over their estimated useful lives. This approach provides a stable and consistent [basis](../b/basis.md) for valuing the company’s extensive portfolio of assets.

### Case Study: ExxonMobil
ExxonMobil (https://corporate.exxonmobil.com) is another example of a company that employs the historical cost principle. ExxonMobil reports its property, plant, and equipment at historical cost, subject to [depreciation](../d/depreciation.md) over their useful lives. This method ensures reliable and verifiable financial information, reflecting the company’s long-term investment in its operating assets.

## Conclusion
Historical cost is a foundational principle in [financial accounting](../f/financial_accounting.md) that provides an objective, verifiable, and consistent [basis](../b/basis.md) for [asset valuation](../a/asset_valuation.md). While it may not always reflect current [market](../m/market.md) conditions, it ensures the integrity and reliability of [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md). Despite the challenges and limitations, historical cost remains a widely accepted and utilized method for reporting the [value](../v/value.md) of assets in many industries and sectors. Understanding its applications, advantages, and drawbacks is essential for professionals and stakeholders in the field of [accounting](../a/accounting.md) and [finance](../f/finance.md).

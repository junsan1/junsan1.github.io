# Home Warranty

## Introduction

A [home](../h/home.md) [warranty](../w/warranty.md) is a service contract that covers the repair or replacement of important [home](../h/home.md) system components and appliances that [fail](../f/fail.md) due to normal wear and tear. These warranties are often used by homeowners to protect themselves from the high costs associated with major [home](../h/home.md) repairs. Commonly covered systems include electrical, plumbing, heating, and cooling, while covered appliances often include refrigerators, ovens, dishwashers, and washing machines.

## How Home Warranties Work

### Purchasing a Home Warranty

Homeowners typically purchase warranties through [home](../h/home.md) [warranty](../w/warranty.md) companies, which [offer](../o/offer.md) various plans and coverage [options](../o/options.md). The process involves:
- Selecting a Plan: Customers choose from basic to comprehensive plans, depending on their needs and [budget](../b/budget.md).
- Paying a [Premium](../p/premium.md): Homeowners pay an annual or monthly [premium](../p/premium.md) for the coverage.
- Service Calls: When a covered item needs repair or replacement, the homeowner files a claim, and a service technician is dispatched to assess the problem.

### Coverage and Exclusions

While [home](../h/home.md) warranties cover a wide [range](../r/range.md) of items, it's essential to understand that each contract has specific inclusions and exclusions. Typical exclusions might include:
- Pre-existing conditions
- Damage from natural disasters
- Failures due to improper maintenance
- Cosmetic defects

## Benefits of Home Warranties

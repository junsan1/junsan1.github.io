# Head Fake

In trading, particularly in the context of stock and cryptocurrency markets, a "head fake" refers to a situation where the price of a trading instrument makes a move in one direction, convincing traders that it [will](../w/will.md) continue moving in that direction, and then reverses course significantly. This phenomenon can trap traders on the wrong side of the [market](../m/market.md), leading to potential losses. Head fakes are often used in algorithms, [market manipulation](../m/market_manipulation.md) tactics, or might occur naturally in highly volatile markets.

### The Anatomy of a Head Fake

A head fake typically involves the following sequence of events:

1. **Initial Movement**: The price or [index](../i/index_instrument.md) breaks out of a trading [range](../r/range.md) or moves through a significant level, such as support or resistance.
2. **Convincing [Expansion](../e/expansion.md)**: The price extends its move, which can attract further buying or selling due to traders implementing [breakout](../b/breakout.md) strategies.
3. **[Reversal](../r/reversal.md)**: After attracting enough participation, the price reverses direction sharply, often leading to [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md) being triggered and traders being caught off guard.

### Types of Head Fakes

1. **Bullish Head Fake**: This occurs when the price initially breaks out upward from a [consolidation](../c/consolidation.md) [range](../r/range.md), leading traders to believe that a new bullish [trend](../t/trend.md) has started. Shortly after, the price reverses and begins to move downward.

2. **Bearish Head Fake**: This happens when the price breaks downward, convincing traders of a bearish continuation. However, the price then abruptly shifts direction and begins to rise.

### Causes of Head Fakes

#### **Market Manipulation**

[Market](../m/market.md) makers or large institutions sometimes use head fakes to manipulate prices. By inducing a [false breakout](../f/false_breakout.md), these entities can create [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) for their large orders without significantly altering the [market price](../m/market_price.md).

#### **News Events**

Unanticipated news can cause sudden sentiment changes, leading to rapid movements that may prove to be head fakes. For instance, an [earnings announcement](../e/earnings_announcement.md), economic data release, or geopolitical event might initially appear bullish or bearish, only for the [market](../m/market.md) to reassess and move in the opposite direction.

#### **Algorithmic Trading**

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) strategies, including high-frequency trading (HFT), can exacerbate head fakes. Algorithms might detect [breakout](../b/breakout.md) patterns and act on them swiftly, causing an initial price surge that quickly reverses when the algorithms exit their positions.

### Identifying Head Fakes

Identifying head fakes in real-time is challenging. However, several techniques can help traders reduce the [risk](../r/risk.md) of being caught in one:

#### **Volume Analysis**

Looking at [volume](../v/volume.md) can provide clues about the validity of a price move. Genuine breakouts are typically accompanied by high trading [volume](../v/volume.md), whereas head fakes might exhibit a [volume](../v/volume.md) spike that quickly dissipates.

#### **Confirmation Indicators**

Using [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) like the Moving Average Convergence [Divergence](../d/divergence.md) (MACD), [Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (RSI), or Simple Moving Averages (SMA) for confirmation can help mitigate head fake risks. For example, if a bullish [breakout](../b/breakout.md) occurs but is not confirmed by the MACD, the [breakout](../b/breakout.md) might be a head fake.

#### **Support and Resistance Zones**

Being aware of longer-term [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels can provide important context. False breakouts often occur near significant historical levels, making those areas potential head fake zones.

### Example of a Head Fake Scenario

Imagine a situation in which Company XYZâ€™s stock is trading within a [range](../r/range.md) of $50 to $60. Traders are closely watching the $60 resistance level for a [breakout](../b/breakout.md). One day, the stock price moves swiftly and breaks through $60, reaching $62. Seeing this move, [breakout](../b/breakout.md) traders might rush to buy the stock expecting further gains. However, the price fails to sustain the rise and quickly drops back below $60, catching many traders in a losing position. This pattern reflects a classic bullish head fake.

### Impact and Management

The impact of head fakes can be significant, leading to financial losses and shaken confidence. Effective management strategies include:

1. **[Stop-Loss Orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md)**: Employing tight [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md) just below (or above) the [breakout](../b/breakout.md) level can limit the damage if a head fake occurs.
2. **Reduced Position Sizes**: Reducing position size when trading breakouts can help manage [risk](../r/risk.md).
3. **Wait for Confirmation**: Patiently waiting for price confirmation after the [breakout](../b/breakout.md) can reduce the likelihood of entering a head fake.

### Case Studies

#### **Flash Crash of 2010**

On May 6, 2010, the U.S. stock markets experienced a sudden and severe crash, followed by a rapid recovery within minutes. This event, known as the Flash Crash, featured numerous head fakes in individual [stocks](../s/stock.md) and indices. [High-frequency trading algorithms](../h/high-frequency_trading_algorithms.md) exacerbated the [volatility](../v/volatility.md), creating rapid price movements that trapped traders on both sides.

#### **Cryptocurrency Market**

The highly volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets makes them particularly susceptible to head fakes. [Bitcoin](../b/bitcoin.md), [Ethereum](../e/ethereum_.md), and other major cryptocurrencies have frequently shown patterns where prices break important [psychological levels](../p/psychological_levels_in_trading.md) only to reverse sharply. Continuous monitoring of volumes and sentiment is crucial in these markets to avoid head fakes.

### Conclusion

The concept of a head fake is an important aspect of trading to understand. Recognizing the signs and employing strategies to manage potential head fake risks can markedly improve trading outcomes. While impossible to avoid entirely, with vigilant analysis, traders can reduce their susceptibility to these misleading [market](../m/market.md) moves.

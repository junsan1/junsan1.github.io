# Hypothesis Testing

Hypothesis testing is a statistical method that allows traders to make inferences or draw conclusions about a population based on data collected from a sample. This method is particularly crucial in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) (also known as algo-trading), where decisions based on large datasets and statistical models can lead to significant financial gains or losses. Hypothesis testing helps to validate strategies, quantify risks, and enhance the robustness of [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md). 

### Understanding Hypothesis Testing

At its core, hypothesis testing involves the following steps:
1. **Formulating Hypotheses**: This involves stating two opposing hypotheses – the [null hypothesis](../n/null_hypothesis.md) (\(H_0\)) and the alternative hypothesis (\(H_1\)).
2. **Selecting a Significance Level**: Often denoted by [alpha](../a/alpha.md) (\(\[alpha](../a/alpha.md)\)), this is the probability of rejecting the [null hypothesis](../n/null_hypothesis.md) when it is actually true. Common choices for \(\[alpha](../a/alpha.md)\) are 0.05, 0.01, and 0.10.
3. **Determining the Test Statistic**: This involves choosing a statistic that [will](../w/will.md) allow the [trader](../t/trader.md) to test the hypotheses.
4. **Calculating the Test Statistic**: Using sample data to calculate the test statistic.
5. **Making a Decision**: Comparing the calculated statistic to a critical [value](../v/value.md) to decide whether to reject or [fail](../f/fail.md) to reject the [null hypothesis](../n/null_hypothesis.md).

### Types of Hypothesis Tests

Several types of hypothesis tests are applicable in the context of algo-trading, each suited for different scenarios:
1. **[Z-test](../z/z-test_in_trading.md)**: Used when the sample size is large (n > 30) and the population variance is known.
2. **[T-test](../t/t-test.md)**: Used when the sample size is small (n < 30) and the population variance is unknown.
3. **[Chi-Square Test](../c/chi-square_test.md)**: Used for testing relationships between categorical variables.
4. **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**: Used to compare means across three or more samples.

### Formulating Hypotheses

In [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), hypotheses often revolve around the effectiveness of a [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) or the presence of a [market](../m/market.md) [anomaly](../a/anomaly.md). An example might be:
- **[Null Hypothesis](../n/null_hypothesis.md) (\(H_0\))**: The new trading algorithm does not provide a higher [return](../r/return.md) than the existing one.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (\(H_1\))**: The new trading algorithm provides a higher [return](../r/return.md) than the existing one.

Creating hypotheses like these enables traders to perform experiments that systematically validate new strategies or models.

### Significance Level in Trading

The significance level (\(\[alpha](../a/alpha.md)\)) is a pivotal component of hypothesis testing. In trading, common levels are:
- **0.05 (5%)**: Provides a balanced approach between Type I (false positive) and Type II (false negative) errors.
- **0.01 (1%)**: Used for more conservative testing, leading to fewer false positives.
- **0.10 (10%)**: Used when traders want to be more lenient in their testing.

The choice of \(\[alpha](../a/alpha.md)\) depends on the [trader](../t/trader.md)’s [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) and the context in which the hypothesis test is conducted.

### Selecting the Test Statistic

The test statistic selected depends on the data type, sample size, and whether population variance is known. In algo-trading, common choices include:
- **[Z-score](../z/z-score.md)**: Suitable for large sample sizes with known variances.
- **T-score**: Ideal for small sample sizes with unknown variances.
- **Chi-square statistic**: Used for categorical data.
- **F-statistic**: Used in ANOVA for comparing variances across [multiple](../m/multiple.md) groups.

### Execution in Algo-Trading

In practice, hypothesis testing in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) involves several steps:

#### Data Collection and Preprocessing
Gathering financial data is the first step. This can be done through APIs provided by financial service providers such as:
- [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/)
- [QuantConnect](https://www.quantconnect.com/)

Data preprocessing includes cleaning data, dealing with missing values, and normalizing numerical data.

#### Formulating and Testing Hypotheses
With data in hand, traders formulate their hypotheses and select an appropriate test. For example:
- Testing if a moving average crossover strategy performs better than a buy-and-[hold](../h/hold.md) strategy:
  - **[Null Hypothesis](../n/null_hypothesis.md)**: The moving average crossover strategy does not [yield](../y/yield.md) a higher [average return](../a/average_return.md).
  - **Alternative Hypothesis**: The moving average crossover strategy yields a higher [average return](../a/average_return.md).

The [t-test](../t/t-test.md) might be chosen due to small sample sizes or unknown variances.

#### Computing the Test Statistic
Using statistical software or programming languages like Python and R:
- **Python Example**:
  ```python
  from scipy [import](../i/import.md) stats
  returns_ma = [...]  # returns from moving average strategy
  returns_bh = [...]  # returns from buy-and-[hold](../h/hold.md) strategy
  t_statistic, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(returns_ma, returns_bh)
  ```

- **R Example**:
  ```r
  returns_ma <- c(...)  # returns from moving average strategy
  returns_bh <- c(...)  # returns from buy-and-[hold](../h/hold.md) strategy
  t.test(returns_ma, returns_bh)
  ```

#### Making Decisions
Based on the p-[value](../v/value.md) obtained from the test statistic:
- If \(p \le \[alpha](../a/alpha.md)\), reject the [null hypothesis](../n/null_hypothesis.md).
- If \(p > \[alpha](../a/alpha.md)\), [fail](../f/fail.md) to reject the [null hypothesis](../n/null_hypothesis.md).

### Applications in Trading

Hypothesis testing fares extremely well in [multiple](../m/multiple.md) trading scenarios, including but not limited to:

#### Strategy Development
Traders use hypothesis testing to compare various [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). For example, to verify if one strategy performs better in a [bull market](../b/bull_market.md) while another excels in a [bear market](../b/bear_market.md).

#### Market Anomalies Detection
Hypothesis testing can verify the existence of [market anomalies](../m/market_anomalies.md) like the [January effect](../j/january_effect.md) or the [weekend effect](../w/weekend_effect.md).

#### Model Validation
Before implementing a trading model, hypothesis testing ensures its robustness and validity based on historical data.

### Conclusion

Hypothesis testing is a vital component of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), addressing the empirical rigor needed to validate [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) and models. Whether testing a new strategy or validating an existing one, hypothesis testing ensures that traders make informed, data-driven decisions that align with their [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) and investment goals.

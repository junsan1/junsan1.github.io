# Hedging Portfolio Risk

## Introduction
Hedging portfolio risk is a critical strategy in [portfolio management](../p/portfolio_management.md) to reduce the exposure to adverse market conditions and minimize potential losses. In financial markets where [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) and volatility are commonplace, effective hedging can be the difference between preserving capital and suffering irreparable losses. This documentation delves into the concept of hedging portfolio risk, examining the various strategies, tools, and principles used to manage and mitigate these exposures.

## What is Hedging?
Hedging is an investment strategy used to offset potential losses in one asset by taking an opposite position in a related asset. The premise of hedging is to protect investors from market risks and price fluctuations. Although it can limit the potential gains, it is primarily used to provide a safety net against adverse price movements.

## Types of Risks
### Market Risk
Market risk, or [systematic risk](../s/systematic_risk.md), is the risk of losses due to changes in market conditions such as fluctuations in prices, interest rates, and currency exchange rates.

### Credit Risk
Credit risk, or default risk, refers to the risk that an issuer of a debt instrument will be unable to meet their contractual obligations.

### Liquidity Risk
[Liquidity risk](../l/liquidity_risk.md) is the risk that an asset cannot be sold quickly enough in the market to prevent a loss or meet an obligation.

### Operational Risk
Operational risk arises from failures in internal processes, people, or systems, or from external events.

## Hedging Instruments
### Derivatives
[Derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) such as options, futures, and swaps are the most commonly used instruments in hedging.

#### Options
Options provide the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an asset at a predetermined price and date.

#### Futures
[Futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) involve agreeing to buy or sell an asset at a set date in the future at a specified price.

#### Swaps
Swaps involve exchanging cash flows or other financial instruments between two parties to manage risk.

### Short Selling
[Short selling](../s/short_selling.md) involves selling a borrowed asset with the expectation that its price will decline, enabling it to be bought back at a lower price.

### Diversification
Diversification involves spreading investments across various assets to reduce exposure to any single asset or risk.

## Popular Hedging Strategies
### Portfolio Hedging with Index Options
This strategy involves purchasing [index options](../i/index_options.md) to protect against downturns in the market. For instance, buying a put option on an equity index can offset losses in a stock portfolio.

### Fixed-Income Hedging
Fixed-income portfolios might use [interest rate futures](../i/interest_rate_futures.md) or swaps to hedge against interest rate risk. For example, entering into an interest rate swap where the portfolio receives a fixed rate and pays a floating rate can protect against rising rates.

### Currency Hedging
Investors with international holdings might engage in [currency hedging](../c/currency_hedging.md) using forex futures or options to protect against currency fluctuations.

### Commodity Hedging
Commodity producers and consumers often use [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) to hedge against price changes in physical commodities, such as oil, gold, and agricultural products.

## Implementation and Tools
### Algorithmic Trading
[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) systems can automate [hedging strategies](../h/hedging_strategies.md) by executing predefined rules and formulas, thereby providing precision and speed in managing portfolio risks.

### Risk Management Software
[Software tools](../s/software_tools_for_trading.md) like [Bloomberg](../b/bloomberg.md) Terminal, [FactSet](../f/factset.md), and MSCI Barra provide analytics and frameworks for assessing and managing risk.

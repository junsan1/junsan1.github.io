# Harmonized Sales Tax (HST)

The Harmonized [Sales Tax](../s/sales_tax.md) (HST) is a consumption tax in Canada that combines the federal Goods and Services Tax (GST) with the provincial [sales tax](../s/sales_tax.md) (PST). It is a single, blended tax that simplifies the tax system by merging these two separate [taxes](../t/taxes.md) into one comprehensive tax. The HST applies to almost all goods and services in participating provinces. This is particularly beneficial for businesses as it streamlines the [sales tax](../s/sales_tax.md) collection process and reduces compliance costs.

## Background of HST

Before the implementation of HST, consumers and businesses in Canada had to deal with both the GST and PST. Each provincial government had its own [sales tax](../s/sales_tax.md), which varied in terms of the rate and the regulations. This created a complex and often cumbersome [taxation](../t/taxation.md) system, leading to inefficiencies and a higher administrative burden for businesses that operated in [multiple](../m/multiple.md) provinces.

The HST was first implemented in 1997 in the provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. The goal was to create a more efficient and streamlined [sales tax](../s/sales_tax.md) system that would benefit both consumers and businesses. Over the years, other provinces have also adopted the HST, including Ontario and Prince Edward Island. The combined [tax rate](../t/tax_rate.md) varies by province and is set by the province in collaboration with the federal government.

## Calculation of HST

The HST rate is comprised of two components: the federal portion (the GST) and the provincial portion. As of the most recent data, the GST is set at 5% across Canada, while the provincial portion varies by province. For example, in Ontario, the HST rate is 13%, which includes a 5% federal portion and an 8% provincial portion.

Here is a breakdown of the HST rates by province:

- Newfoundland and Labrador: 15%
- New Brunswick: 15%
- Nova Scotia: 15%
- Ontario: 13%
- Prince Edward Island: 15%

To calculate the HST on a product or service, one simply multiplies the total cost by the HST rate applicable in the province where the [transaction](../t/transaction.md) is taking place. For example, if a product costs $100 in Ontario, the HST would be $13 (13% of $100), making the total cost $113.

## Implementation and Compliance

Businesses that operate in HST-participating provinces are required to register and collect HST on behalf of the government. They also benefit from the Input [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md) (ITC) system, which allows them to reclaim the HST paid on [business](../b/business.md)-related expenses. This reduces the overall tax burden on businesses and promotes investment and [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md).

Businesses must file regular HST returns, usually quarterly or annually, depending on their [revenue](../r/revenue.md). This involves reporting the amount of HST collected from customers and the amount of HST paid on [business](../b/business.md) expenses. The difference between the two amounts is either remitted to the government or refunded to the [business](../b/business.md).

Non-compliance with the HST regulations can result in penalties and [interest](../i/interest.md) charges. Therefore, it's imperative for businesses to maintain accurate records and submit timely HST returns to avoid any legal issues.

## Differences Between GST, PST, and HST

While the HST simplifies the tax system in participating provinces, itâ€™s important to understand the distinctions between the GST, PST, and HST.

- **GST (Goods and Services Tax):** A federal tax that applies to most goods and services in Canada. The current rate is 5%.
- **PST (Provincial [Sales Tax](../s/sales_tax.md)):** A tax levied by individual provinces that do not participate in the HST system. The rates and regulations vary by province.
- **HST (Harmonized [Sales Tax](../s/sales_tax.md)):** A combined tax that includes both the GST and the provincial portion of the [sales tax](../s/sales_tax.md).

Some provinces, such as British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, do not participate in the HST system and continue to use the GST/PST system. Businesses operating in these provinces are required to comply with both the GST and the applicable PST regulations.

## Impact on Consumers

The implementation of the HST has had both positive and negative impacts on consumers. On the positive side, the HST has simplified the tax system, making it easier for consumers to understand the total cost of goods and services. There's no need to calculate two separate [taxes](../t/taxes.md), as the HST is a single, inclusive tax.

However, the HST can also lead to higher overall tax rates in some provinces. For example, in Ontario, consumers who were previously paying only the GST now have to pay the combined HST rate of 13%. This has led to higher costs for certain goods and services, which can be a concern for consumers on a tight [budget](../b/budget.md).

## Economic Implications

The introduction of the HST has had significant economic implications. One of the primary benefits is the reduction in the tax compliance burden for businesses. By streamlining the tax system, the HST reduces the administrative costs associated with collecting and remitting [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [taxes](../t/taxes.md). This is particularly beneficial for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that may not have the resources to manage complex tax compliance requirements.

The HST also promotes investment and [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) by allowing businesses to claim Input Tax Credits (ITCs) for the HST paid on [business](../b/business.md)-related expenses. This reduces the overall tax burden on businesses and frees up [capital](../c/capital.md) for investment in new projects and [expansion](../e/expansion.md).

From a government perspective, the HST provides a more stable and predictable source of [revenue](../r/revenue.md). By combining the GST and PST into a single tax, the government can more easily forecast and manage its [revenue](../r/revenue.md) streams. This is particularly important for funding public services and [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) projects.

## Criticisms and Controversies

The implementation of the HST has not been without its criticisms and controversies. One of the primary criticisms is the impact on low-[income](../i/income.md) consumers. The HST can lead to higher overall tax rates in some provinces, which disproportionately affects low-[income](../i/income.md) individuals and families. To mitigate this impact, some provinces have introduced HST rebates or credits for low-[income](../i/income.md) households.

There has also been political opposition to the HST in some provinces. For example, in British Columbia, the introduction of the HST in 2010 led to widespread public protests and a successful public referendum to repeal the tax. As a result, British Columbia reverted to the separate GST/PST system in 2013.

## Future Outlook

The future of the HST in Canada is likely to be shaped by ongoing economic and political factors. Some provinces may consider adopting the HST if it proves to be a more efficient and effective tax system. However, political opposition and concerns about the impact on consumers [will](../w/will.md) continue to be significant considerations.

In the long term, the HST has the potential to promote [economic growth](../e/economic_growth.md) and investment by reducing the tax compliance burden on businesses and providing a stable source of government [revenue](../r/revenue.md). However, careful consideration and balanced policies [will](../w/will.md) be essential to ensure that the benefits of the HST are realized without disproportionately impacting low-[income](../i/income.md) consumers and creating political unrest.

# Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR)

The Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) is a daily [reference rate](../r/reference_rate.md), published by the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB), for interbank lending in the Hong Kong [market](../m/market.md). This rate is crucial for several financial operations, including [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) (algotrading), as it serves as a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for a variety of financial products and contracts. HIBOR is comparable to other global [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) rates such as LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) and EURIBOR ([Euro](../e/euro.md) Interbank Offered Rate), but it is special to the Hong Kong region and is quoted in Hong Kong dollars (HKD). This comprehensive overview dives into HIBOR's characteristics, its calculation, significance in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), and implications for [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md).

## Calculation of HIBOR

HIBOR is calculated based on the interbank [interest](../i/interest.md) rates offered by a panel of banks in Hong Kong. The process involves:

1. **Submission**: Each day, between 11:00 AM and noon, a designated panel of banks submits their offered rates for various maturities, ranging from overnight to one year.
2. **Exclusion of Outliers**: To ensure the rate is not skewed by outliers, the highest and lowest quartiles of the submitted rates are excluded.
3. **Averaging**: The remaining rates are averaged to determine the HIBOR for each corresponding [maturity](../m/maturity.md).

The rates are published by the HKAB around noon each [business](../b/business.md) day.

## Panel of Banks

The panel is composed of both local and international banks operating in Hong Kong. As of the last update, the panel includes major banks such as HSBC, Standard Chartered, and [Bank](../b/bank.md) of China (Hong Kong). The participation of these diverse institutions ensures a [robust](../r/robust.md) and reliable measure of the interbank funding costs.

## Historical Context

The HIBOR was introduced in 1983, during a period of significant financial [expansion](../e/expansion.md) in Hong Kong. It has since become a critical [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of the cost of borrowing in the Hong Kong financial [market](../m/market.md). The historical data on HIBOR is archived and can be accessed via the HKAB's official website: [Hong Kong Association of Banks - HIBOR](https://www.hkab.org.hk).

## Significance in Financial Markets

### Benchmark for Loans and Mortgages

HIBOR is widely used as a [reference rate](../r/reference_rate.md) for Hong Kong dollar-denominated loans and mortgages. When banks lend to consumers or businesses, the [interest](../i/interest.md) rates on these loans are often set as a spread over the HIBOR, reflecting both the cost of interbank lending and the [credit risk](../c/credit_risk.md) of the borrower.

### Derivatives and Financial Products

HIBOR also serves as the [basis](../b/basis.md) for a variety of [derivative](../d/derivative.md) instruments, including [interest rate swaps](../i/interest_rate_swaps.md) and [forward rate](../f/forward_rate.md) agreements. These [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) allow traders and institutions to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) risks associated with fluctuating [interest](../i/interest.md) rates or to speculate on future changes in rates.

### Yield Curves and Bond Pricing

For government and corporate bonds issued in Hong Kong dollars, HIBOR is instrumental in constructing the [yield curve](../y/yard.md), which represents the relationship between [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and maturities. This [yield curve](../y/yard.md) is essential for pricing bonds and other fixed-[income](../i/income.md) securities.

### International Comparisons

HIBOR is often compared to other global [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) rates like LIBOR and EURIBOR to gauge relative funding costs between different [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). This comparison is particularly significant for multinational corporations and financial institutions engaging in cross-border transactions.

## Impact on Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), or algotrading, leverages advanced [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md) and high-speed computing to execute trades. The implications of HIBOR for algotrading can be seen across several domains:

### Trading Strategies

Algorithmic traders often incorporate [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) data, including HIBOR, into their [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). For example, mean-reversion strategies might exploit short-term deviations from typical HIBOR levels, while [momentum](../m/momentum.md) strategies could [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on trends in the rate over time.

### Arbitrage Opportunities

[Arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md) algorithms look for price discrepancies between correlated financial instruments. Differences between HIBOR and other [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) rates like LIBOR can create [arbitrage opportunities](../a/arbitrage_opportunities.md). By executing trades that exploit these discrepancies, traders can potentially lock in [risk](../r/risk.md)-free profits.

### Risk Management

Algotraders use HIBOR as a [factor](../f/factor.md) in [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) algorithms. Changes in the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) environment can impact the [value](../v/value.md) of their portfolios, making it crucial to adjust positions dynamically in response to HIBOR fluctuations.

### Liquidity Provision

Some algorithmic traders act as [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) providers in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). They use HIBOR to price their bids and offers accurately, ensuring that they can buy low and sell high while maintaining tight [spreads](../s/spreads.md). This activity contributes to overall [market efficiency](../m/market_efficiency.md) and stability.

### Backtesting and Optimization

Algotraders rely on historical HIBOR data for [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) their strategies. By testing strategies against past fluctuations in HIBOR, traders can refine their algorithms to perform better under different [market](../m/market.md) conditions. Historical data also aids in the [optimization](../o/optimization.md) of parameter settings for [trading models](../t/trading_models.md).

## Regulatory Environment

### Supervision by the HKMA

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) oversees the integrity of the financial [market](../m/market.md), including the conduct of banks on the HIBOR panel. This supervision ensures that the rate remains an accurate reflection of the interbank lending [market](../m/market.md) and mitigates potential manipulations.

### Compliance Requirements

Financial institutions using HIBOR-linked products must comply with regulatory requirements related to [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and fair dealing. This includes proper [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) of how HIBOR is utilized in [loan](../l/loan.md) agreements and [derivative](../d/derivative.md) contracts.

### Impact of Global Reforms

Global reforms aimed at improving the reliability of [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) rates, such as the transition from LIBOR to SOFR (Secured Overnight [Financing](../f/financing.md) Rate) in the United States, also influence HIBOR. The HKMA and HKAB continuously assess HIBOR's methodology to align with international [best practices](../b/best_practices.md).

## Future Prospects

### Evolution of Benchmark Rates

As [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) evolve, so does the methodology for calculating [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) rates. For HIBOR, ongoing enhancements aim to ensure its robustness and accuracy. These evolutions include potential shifts to [transaction](../t/transaction.md)-based rates that better reflect real [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

### Technological Integration

Advancements in technology, such as [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) and [artificial intelligence](../a/artificial_intelligence_in_trading.md), are likely to influence the future of HIBOR. For example, [distributed ledger technology](../d/distributed_ledger_technology.md) could enhance the [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and [security](../s/security.md) of the rate-setting process, while AI could provide more sophisticated models for predicting HIBOR movements.

### Increased Use in Financial Engineering

[Financial engineering](../f/financial_engineering.md) techniques that involve constructing complex financial instruments might increasingly utilize HIBOR. By embedding HIBOR into the pricing models of exotic [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) or structured products, financial engineers can create more customized, hedgeable instruments.

### Greater Globalization

As Hong Kongâ€™s financial [market](../m/market.md) continues to integrate with global markets, HIBOR's influence may extend internationally. This [globalization](../g/globalization.md) could lead to more cross-border transactions involving HIBOR-linked products, necessitating an even closer alignment with other international [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) rates.

## Conclusion

The Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) plays a pivotal role in the financial [market](../m/market.md) of Hong Kong. From serving as a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for loans and [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) to shaping strategic and tactical decisions in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), HIBOR's significance is substantial. For algorithmic traders, keen awareness and sophisticated handling of HIBOR data can markedly enhance both profitability and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md). As [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) continue to evolve and integrate globally, HIBOR's role is expected to expand, underpinned by continual methodological improvements and technological advancements.

# Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP)

The [Home](../h/home.md) Affordable [Refinance](../r/refinance.md) Program (HARP) was a federal government initiative launched in March 2009 to help homeowners who were [underwater](../u/underwater.md) or near-[underwater](../u/underwater.md) on their mortgages [refinance](../r/refinance.md) their loans. The program was designed to provide financial stability to homeowners struggling to make their [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) payments due to falling [home](../h/home.md) prices, which left many owing more on their mortgages than their homes were worth.

## Background and Purpose

In the wake of the 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md), the US housing [market](../m/market.md) faced an unprecedented collapse, resulting in millions of homeowners finding themselves with mortgages that exceeded the [value](../v/value.md) of their homes. This phenomenon is known as being "[underwater](../u/underwater.md)" or "[upside](../u/upside.md)-down" on a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md). Being [underwater](../u/underwater.md) limits homeowners' [options](../o/options.md) to [refinance](../r/refinance.md) their mortgages at lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, as traditional refinancing requires a certain [loan](../l/loan.md)-to-[value](../v/value.md) ratio (LTV).

To address this, the Federal Housing [Finance](../f/finance.md) Agency (FHFA) in conjunction with the US Treasury Department and government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) Fannie Mae and [Freddie Mac](../f/freddie_mac.md) developed HARP. The main goal was to enable responsible homeowners to secure more affordable and sustainable mortgages despite having little to no [equity](../e/equity.md) in their homes.

## Eligibility Criteria

Homeowners needed to meet specific criteria to qualify for HARP:

1. **[Loan](../l/loan.md) [Origination](../o/origination.md) Date:** The [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) must have been originated on or before May 31, 2009.
2. **Ownership:** The [loan](../l/loan.md) must be owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae or [Freddie Mac](../f/freddie_mac.md).
3. **[Payment](../p/payment.md) History:** Homeowners must have a good [payment](../p/payment.md) history, with no late payments in the last six months and no more than one late [payment](../p/payment.md) in the last 12 months.
4. **[Loan](../l/loan.md)-to-[Value](../v/value.md) Ratio (LTV):** Initially, HARP was designed for homeowners with LTV ratios greater than 80%, though later revisions removed maximum LTV limits.
5. **Benefit from [Refinance](../r/refinance.md):** Homeowners must demonstrate that the [refinance](../r/refinance.md) would provide an identifiable benefit, such as a reduction in the monthly [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [payment](../p/payment.md), a more stable [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) product, or removal of [mortgage insurance](../m/mortgage_insurance.md).

## Program Evolution

HARP went through [multiple](../m/multiple.md) revisions to expand its reach and effectiveness:

- **HARP 1.0:** Initially launched in 2009 with stricter LTV requirements and less flexibility.
- **HARP 2.0:** Introduced in December 2011, this version removed the 125% LTV cap, allowed for more lenient [underwriting standards](../u/underwriting_standards.md), and made the program more accessible to a greater number of homeowners.
- **HARP 3.0:** Although discussed and proposed, HARP 3.0 was never officially implemented. It aimed to further expand eligibility, including loans not owned by Fannie Mae or [Freddie Mac](../f/freddie_mac.md).

## Impact and Outcome

HARP provided significant assistance to millions of homeowners. According to the FHFA, HARP helped over 3.4 million homeowners [refinance](../r/refinance.md) their mortgages. The program was particularly beneficial in stabilizing the housing [market](../m/market.md), reducing the [risk](../r/risk.md) of foreclosures, and allowing homeowners to obtain lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, resulting in substantial savings on [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) payments.

## Expiration and Succession

HARP was initially set to expire on December 31, 2013, but due to its success and ongoing need, it was extended several times, ultimately expiring on December 31, 2018. Post-HARP, the FHFA introduced new streamlined [refinance](../r/refinance.md) programs aimed at continuing to provide refinancing [options](../o/options.md) for high LTV borrowers:

- **High LTV [Refinance](../r/refinance.md) Option (Fannie Mae)**
- **Enhanced Relief [Refinance](../r/refinance.md) ([Freddie Mac](../f/freddie_mac.md))**

## Technical and Practical Aspects

### Mortgage Refinancing Mechanics

Refinancing a [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) involves taking out a new [loan](../l/loan.md) to pay off an existing one. This can be achieved through a [rate-and-term refinance](../r/rate-and-term_refinance.md) or [cash-out refinance](../c/cash-out_refinance.md). HARP focused on rate-and-term refinancing, enabling homeowners to take advantage of lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates or move to more favorable [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) terms.

**[Rate-and-term refinance](../r/rate-and-term_refinance.md):** Changes the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md), [loan](../l/loan.md) term, or both, without altering the [loan](../l/loan.md) balance.
**[Cash-out refinance](../c/cash-out_refinance.md):** Allows homeowners to take out a new [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) for more than they owe on their existing [loan](../l/loan.md), pocketing the difference as cash.

### Interest Rate Reduction

One of the key benefits of HARP was the ability to secure a lower [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md), which directly reduced monthly [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) payments. Even a small reduction in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates could lead to substantial savings over the life of the [loan](../l/loan.md).

### Mortgage Insurance

For homeowners whose original loans had private [mortgage insurance](../m/mortgage_insurance.md) (PMI), HARP accommodations allowed them to carry over the existing PMI to the new [loan](../l/loan.md) without incurring additional costs or complications.

## Case Studies and Real-World Examples

### Case Study 1: Middle-Income Homeowner

Mr. and Mrs. Johnson purchased their [home](../h/home.md) in 2007 with a 30-year [fixed-rate mortgage](../f/fixed-rate_mortgage.md) at a 6.5% [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md). By 2010, their house [value](../v/value.md) had decreased, leaving them with a 110% LTV. Despite owning a well-maintained [home](../h/home.md) and making timely payments, they were unable to [refinance](../r/refinance.md) through traditional means. With HARP 2.0, they secured a 4% [fixed-rate mortgage](../f/fixed-rate_mortgage.md), reducing their monthly payments by $300.

### Case Study 2: Coastal Region Homeowner

Ms. Smith owned a property in a coastal region affected by falling property values. Her LTV was 145%, preventing her from obtaining refinancing. HARP enabled her to [refinance](../r/refinance.md) her [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) from an ARM (adjustable-rate [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)) with a high [risk](../r/risk.md) of rising payments to a low [fixed-rate mortgage](../f/fixed-rate_mortgage.md), providing long-term financial stability and avoiding potential future [payment](../p/payment.md) spikes.

## Conclusion

The [Home](../h/home.md) Affordable [Refinance](../r/refinance.md) Program (HARP) was an essential tool in the government's arsenal to combat the fallout from the 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md). By enabling millions of homeowners to [refinance](../r/refinance.md) their [underwater](../u/underwater.md) mortgages, it provided critical relief, helping to stabilize the housing [market](../m/market.md), reduce the [risk](../r/risk.md) of [foreclosure](../f/foreclosure.md), and [offer](../o/offer.md) financial stability to countless families. Although the program has ended, its legacy continues to influence current refinancing [options](../o/options.md) through the programs that succeeded it.

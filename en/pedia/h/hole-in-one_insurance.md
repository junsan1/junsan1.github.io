# Hole-In-One Insurance

**Hole-in-one [insurance](../i/insurance.md)**, also known as **ace [insurance](../i/insurance.md)**, is a type of indemnification for golf tournament organizers or sponsors that covers the cost of a prize offered to any participant who hits a hole-in-one. This coverage provides financial protection against the potentially substantial [payout](../p/payout.md) or reward that would be due to a player achieving this difficult feat. This type of [insurance](../i/insurance.md) is a part of the larger field of event [insurance](../i/insurance.md), which covers various risks associated with organizing and hosting events.

## How Hole-In-One Insurance Works

### Eligibility and Policy Issuance

To purchase hole-in-one [insurance](../i/insurance.md), an interested party (usually the event organizer or sponsor) must provide details about the event, including:

1. **The number of participants**: The more participants, the higher the [risk](../r/risk.md) the insurer is taking on.
2. **The length and difficulty of the hole**: Shorter holes and less challenging courses increase the likelihood of a hole-in-one, thus affecting the [premium](../p/premium.md).
3. **The prize [value](../v/value.md)**: Higher prize values require higher premiums to cover potential payouts.

Upon receiving this information, insurers [will](../w/will.md) assess the [risk](../r/risk.md) and calculate the [premium](../p/premium.md). Policies are issued for the specific event and typically cover only pre-designated holes.

### Setting Conditions

For the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) to remain valid, certain conditions must be met during the tournament:

1. **Minimum Distance**: The hole must usually be at least 150 yards in length, although this may vary by insurer.
2. **Witnesses**: Often, a witness, sometimes a professional observer appointed by the insurer, must be present to verify the hole-in-one.
3. **Certification of Winner**: Precise documentation, including signed scorecards and witness statements, usually needs to be submitted to the insurer post-event.

### Claim Process

If a hole-in-one occurs, the event organizer or sponsor must notify the insurer promptly. This notification typically includes:

1. **Claim form**: Detailed information about the event and the hole-in-one occurrence.
2. **Witness statements**: Verifying the achievement.
3. **Scorecards**: Signed by the player and witnesses.

Once the insurer reviews and verifies the claim, the specified prize [value](../v/value.md) is paid out.

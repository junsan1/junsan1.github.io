# Hedging with Futures

Hedging with [futures](../f/futures.md) is a fundamental [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) strategy employed by both individual investors and large institutions to mitigate the [risk](../r/risk.md) of adverse price movements in an [asset](../a/asset.md). This practice involves taking an offsetting position in [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) to protect against potential losses in an existing position. Below, we delve into the details of this strategy, including its mechanics, types, and real-world applications.

## 1. Introduction to Hedging with Futures

[Futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) are standardized agreements to buy or sell an [asset](../a/asset.md) at a predetermined price on a specified future date. These contracts are traded on exchanges, and each contract specifies the quality and quantity of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). Traders and investors use [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) not only for [speculation](../s/speculation.md) but also for hedging purposes.

Hedging aims to reduce the [risk](../r/risk.md) of price movements in an [asset](../a/asset.md) by taking an opposite position in a related [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md). For instance, if an [investor](../i/investor.md) holds a stock and fears that its price might decline, they might sell [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md). Conversely, if they expect to need to purchase an [asset](../a/asset.md) in the future and fear that its price might rise, they can buy [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md).

### Example Scenarios

- **[Equity](../e/equity.md) Hedging**: An [investor](../i/investor.md) holding a portfolio of [stocks](../s/stock.md) might sell stock [index futures](../i/index_futures.md) to protect against a potential decline in stock prices.
- **[Commodity Hedging](../c/commodity_hedging.md)**: A farmer growing wheat may sell wheat [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) to lock in a selling price for their crop, thereby protecting against a fall in wheat prices.
- **[Currency Hedging](../c/currency_hedging.md)**: A [corporation](../c/corporation.md) with future receivables in foreign [currency](../c/currency.md) might buy [currency](../c/currency.md) [futures](../f/futures.md) to lock in the current [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md), safeguarding against [currency](../c/currency.md) fluctuation.

## 2. Types of Hedging Strategies Using Futures

### 2.1. Long Hedge

A [long hedge](../l/long_hedge.md) is a strategy used to protect against an anticipated increase in the price of an [asset](../a/asset.md). It involves buying [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md). This is commonly used by consumers or processors of commodities who expect to purchase the [asset](../a/asset.md) in the future.

#### Example:
A baking company that uses wheat might buy wheat [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against the possibility of rising wheat prices. By doing so, they can lock in a price for wheat now and secure themselves against any future price increases.

### 2.2. Short Hedge

A short [hedge](../h/hedge.md) is employed to protect against a decline in the price of an [asset](../a/asset.md). It involves selling [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md). This strategy is typically used by producers of commodities or owners of assets who fear a drop in prices.

#### Example:
A [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md) producer might sell [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md) [futures](../f/futures.md) to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against the [risk](../r/risk.md) of falling [crude oil](../c/crude_oil.md) prices. By selling [futures](../f/futures.md), the producer can lock in a price today, ensuring they receive a known price in the future regardless of [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

## 3. Hedge Ratios and Basis Risk

### 3.1. Hedge Ratio
The [hedge ratio](../h/hedge_ratio.md) is the proportion of the position that is hedged using [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md). It is calculated to optimize the [hedge](../h/hedge.md), minimizing [risk](../r/risk.md).

\[ \text{Hedge Ratio} = \frac{\text{Value of [Futures Contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md)}}{\text{[Value](../v/value.md) of [Asset](../a/asset.md)}}\]

A [hedge ratio](../h/hedge_ratio.md) of 1.0 indicates a perfect [hedge](../h/hedge.md), where the entire [value](../v/value.md) of the [asset](../a/asset.md) is mirrored by the [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md).

### 3.2. Basis Risk
[Basis risk](../b/basis_risk.md) arises because the [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md) might not perfectly align with the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md). The [basis](../b/basis.md) is the difference between the [spot price](../s/spot_price.md) of the [asset](../a/asset.md) and the [futures](../f/futures.md) price. [Basis risk](../b/basis_risk.md) is the [risk](../r/risk.md) that this difference, or [basis](../b/basis.md), [will](../w/will.md) not remain constant.

\[ \text{Basis} = \text{[Spot Price](../s/spot_price.md)} - \text{[Futures](../f/futures.md) Price}\]

Changing [basis](../b/basis.md) can affect the effectiveness of a [hedge](../h/hedge.md). For example, if the [basis](../b/basis.md) strengthens (i.e., becomes more positive or less negative), a short hedger’s position improves. Conversely, a weakening [basis](../b/basis.md) worsens the position.

## 4. Margin and Mark-to-Market

### 4.1. Margin
When entering into a [futures contract](../f/futures_contract.md), parties are required to post an [initial margin](../i/initial_margin.md)—a form of [security](../s/security.md) [deposit](../d/deposit.md). Additionally, there is a [maintenance margin](../m/maintenance_margin.md) requirement. If the [value](../v/value.md) of the [margin account](../m/margin_account.md) falls below the [maintenance margin](../m/maintenance_margin.md), a [margin call](../m/margin_call.md) is issued, demanding funds to restore [margin](../m/margin.md) levels.

### 4.2. Mark-to-Market
[Futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) are marked-to-[market](../m/market.md) daily, meaning gains and losses are settled at the end of each trading day. This ensures each party fulfills their financial [obligations](../o/obligation.md) on a daily [basis](../b/basis.md). The process of marking-to-[market](../m/market.md) can cause daily fluctuations in the [margin account](../m/margin_account.md), leading to [margin](../m/margin.md) calls.

## 5. Industry Applications and Real-World Examples

### 5.1. Agricultural Products
Farmers often use [futures contracts](../f/futures_contracts.md) to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against price [volatility](../v/volatility.md). For example, a corn farmer might sell corn [futures](../f/futures.md) to lock in prices before harvesting. This ensures they can cover costs and achieve a predictable [revenue](../r/revenue.md).

### 5.2. Energy Sector
Energy companies frequently use [futures](../f/futures.md) to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against fluctuating prices of oil, natural gas, and electricity. For instance, a natural gas [utility](../u/utility.md) company may buy natural gas [futures](../f/futures.md) to secure a known price for future delivery, ensuring they can provide stable pricing for consumers.

### 5.3. Financial Institutions
Banks and other financial institutions use [futures](../f/futures.md) to manage [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) and [currency](../c/currency.md) [risk](../r/risk.md). A [bank](../b/bank.md) worried about rising [interest](../i/interest.md) rates might use [interest rate futures](../i/interest_rate_futures.md) to [hedge](../h/hedge.md). Additionally, if a [bank](../b/bank.md) has international exposure, it may use [currency](../c/currency.md) [futures](../f/futures.md) to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) movements.

#### Example Company
- **CME Group**: A global markets company providing [futures](../f/futures.md) and [options on futures](../o/options_on_futures.md) trading in a broad array of [asset](../a/asset.md) classes, including agriculture, energy, metals, and financials. [Website](https://www.cmegroup.com/)

### 5.4. Corporations
Multinational companies often have exposure to various risks related to [commodity](../c/commodity.md) prices, [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, or currencies. They use [futures](../f/futures.md) to stabilize operating and [financing](../f/financing.md) costs.

#### Example Company
- **Cargill**: An international provider of food, agriculture, financial, and industrial products and services, using [futures](../f/futures.md) extensively to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) [commodity](../c/commodity.md) price risks. [Website](https://www.cargill.com/)

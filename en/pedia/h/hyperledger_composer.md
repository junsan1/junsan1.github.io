# Hyperledger Composer

[Hyperledger](../h/hyperledger.md) Composer is an [open](../o/open.md)-source tool that enables [business](../b/business.md) owners, analysts, system integrators, and developers to create [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) applications and [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md) aimed at solving [business](../b/business.md) issues. Developed under the [Hyperledger](../h/hyperledger.md) project by the Linux Foundation, it is a suite of high-level tools designed for building [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) [business](../b/business.md) networks in [Hyperledger Fabric](../h/hyperledger_fabric.md). 

[Hyperledger](../h/hyperledger.md) Composer is particularly useful because it speeds up the development process and simplifies the creation of [smart contracts](../s/smart_contracts_in_trading.md), which are digital contracts that are self-executing with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. [Hyperledger](../h/hyperledger.md) Composer significantly reduces the [barriers to entry](../b/barriers_to_entry.md) for [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) application development.

## Key Features of Hyperledger Composer

1. **Modeling Language:**
   - [Hyperledger](../h/hyperledger.md) Composer uses a modeling language to define the structure of the [business](../b/business.md) network, including assets, participants, and transactions. The language is easy to understand and allows developers to describe the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) logic in a manner that closely resembles [business](../b/business.md) language.
   
2. **[Business](../b/business.md) Network Archive:**
   - Users can deploy a [business](../b/business.md) network archive (BNA), which is a package containing all the necessary files for a [business](../b/business.md) network. This includes model files (.cto), script files (.js), access control files (.acl), and query files (.qry).
   
3. **Integration with [Hyperledger Fabric](../h/hyperledger_fabric.md):**
   - [Hyperledger](../h/hyperledger.md) Composer provides a seamless integration with [Hyperledger Fabric](../h/hyperledger_fabric.md). Once developed, the [business](../b/business.md) network can be deployed on [Hyperledger Fabric](../h/hyperledger_fabric.md), allowing for the use of its [robust](../r/robust.md) consensus mechanisms and [security](../s/security.md) features.
   
4. **Testing:**
   - [Hyperledger](../h/hyperledger.md) Composer includes tools for testing [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) applications. Developers can write unit tests for the [business](../b/business.md) logic and end-to-end tests for the entire [business](../b/business.md) network.
   
5. **REST API Generation:**
   - One of the significant advantages of [Hyperledger](../h/hyperledger.md) Composer is its auto-generation of REST APIs from the defined [business](../b/business.md) network model. This allows for easy integration with existing systems and enables front-end applications to interact with the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) without needing to [handle](../h/handle.md) complex [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) transactions.

## Components of Hyperledger Composer

### Business Network Definition

A [Business](../b/business.md) Network Definition (BND) in [Hyperledger](../h/hyperledger.md) Composer is a package that defines the declarative and programmatic components of a [business](../b/business.md) network. Each BND is typically composed of [multiple](../m/multiple.md) files, including:

- **Model Files (.cto):** These define the structure of the [business](../b/business.md) network, describing assets, participants, transactions, and relationships using the Composer Modeling Language.
  
- **Script Files (.js):** These contain [transaction](../t/transaction.md) logic for the [business](../b/business.md) network and are written in JavaScript. 
  
- **Access Control Files (.acl):** These specify the rules for permissions and access control within the [business](../b/business.md) network, determining who can read or write to the ledger.
  
- **Query Files (.qry):** These define complex queries that can be executed on the [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) ledger using [Hyperledger](../h/hyperledger.md) Composer's query language.

### Composer Modeling Language

The modeling language in [Hyperledger](../h/hyperledger.md) Composer is crucial for defining the elements of the [business](../b/business.md) network. It allows users to describe:

- **Participants:** Represent individuals or organizations that interact with the [business](../b/business.md) network.
  
- **Assets:** Represent tangible or intangible items that the [business](../b/business.md) network tracks.
  
- **Transactions:** Define valid activities that can occur within the [business](../b/business.md) network, affecting assets and participants.
  
- **Events:** Notification mechanisms that can be emitted by transactions and received by participants.

### Composer Playground

The Composer Playground (https://composer-playground.mybluemix.net) is a web-based interface that allows users to model, define, and test their [business](../b/business.md) networks without needing extensive setup. It provides a user-friendly environment to create BNDs, manage identities, and simulate transactions.

### Fabric Integration

[Hyperledger](../h/hyperledger.md) Composer utilizes [Hyperledger Fabric](../h/hyperledger_fabric.md) (https://www.[hyperledger](../h/hyperledger.md).org/use/fabric) as the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) platform, which provides a modular architecture for distributed ledger solutions. The integration includes seamless deployment of BNDs on a Fabric network, leveraging Fabricâ€™s [robust](../r/robust.md) features like consensus mechanisms, channels, MSP (Membership Service Provider), and more.

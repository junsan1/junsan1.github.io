4. **Government Loans and Grants:**
    - Programs like the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Title I [Home](../h/home.md) Improvement [Loan](../l/loan.md) Program or the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Adapted Housing Grants provide financial aid for specific types of modifications.

## Hiring Contractors

Choosing the right contractor is crucial for the success of any [home](../h/home.md) modification project. Here are some steps to ensure you hire a competent and reliable contractor:

1. **Research and Recommendations:**
    - Ask friends, family, and neighbors for referrals.
    - Read online reviews and ratings on websites like Better [Business](../b/business.md) Bureau (BBB), Yelp, and Angie's List.

2. **Verify Credentials:**
    - [Check](../c/check.md) the contractor’s license and [insurance](../i/insurance.md) status to protect against [liability](../l/liability.md) for accidents or damages.
    - Ensure the contractor has experience with similar projects.

3. **Request Quotes:**
    - Get detailed written estimates from [multiple](../m/multiple.md) contractors to compare costs and services.
    - Be wary of quotes that are significantly lower than others, as this may indicate potential cut corners or hidden fees.

4. **Contractual Agreement:**
    - Ensure all details are spelled out in a written contract, including the [scope](../s/scope.md) of work, materials to be used, start and completion dates, and [payment](../p/payment.md) schedule.
    - Avoid paying large upfront sums; instead, make payments based on project milestones.

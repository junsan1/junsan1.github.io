# Horizontal Spread Strategies

## Overview

[Horizontal spread](../h/horizontal_spread.md) strategies, also known as calendar [spreads](../s/spreads.md), involve the simultaneous purchase and [sale](../s/sale.md) of two [options](../o/options.md) of the same class (calls or puts) with the same [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) but different expiration dates. These strategies are designed to [profit](../p/profit.md) from [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) and changes in [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and can be a critical component of an algorithmic [trader](../t/trader.md)'s toolkit.

## Basic Concepts

### Options

[Options](../o/options.md) are financial [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) at a specified [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) before a specified [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md). They can be broadly classified into calls and puts:
- **Calls:** Give the owner the right to buy the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).
- **Puts:** Give the owner the right to sell the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md).

### Time Decay (Theta)

One of the unique aspects of [options](../o/options.md) is [time decay](../t/time_decay.md), measured by the Greek letter [Theta](../t/theta.md). This represents the rate at which an option's price decreases as the [expiration date](../e/expiration_date.md) approaches. Horizontal [spreads](../s/spreads.md) [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on this concept by leveraging [options](../o/options.md) with different maturities.

### Volatility

[Volatility](../v/volatility.md) is another critical parameter in [options](../o/options.md) pricing. It represents the degree of variation in the price of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) over time. In horizontal [spreads](../s/spreads.md), traders often look for [volatility](../v/volatility.md) discrepancies between different expiration dates.

## Types of Horizontal Spread Strategies

### Long Calendar Spread

A [long calendar spread](../l/long_calendar_spread.md) involves buying a long-term option and selling a short-term option with the same [strike price](../s/strike_price.md). The strategy aims to benefit from the quicker [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) of the short-term option compared to the long-term option.

#### Example

- Buy 1 XYZ Dec 50 Call
- Sell 1 XYZ Oct 50 Call

**Objective:** Benefit from the faster [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) ([Theta](../t/theta.md) decay) of the October option while maintaining the December option.

### Short Calendar Spread

In a short calendar spread, a [trader](../t/trader.md) sells a long-term option and buys a short-term option, both with the same [strike price](../s/strike_price.md). This strategy is generally more advanced and is used when one expects a significant move in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price before the short-term option expires.

#### Example

- Sell 1 XYZ Dec 50 Call
- Buy 1 XYZ Oct 50 Call

**Objective:** [Gain](../g/gain.md) from the movement in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price before the October option expires.

## Factors Influencing Horizontal Spreads

### Implied Volatility

Changes in implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md) can significantly impact the profitability of horizontal [spreads](../s/spreads.md). Typically, traders look for a spike in implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md) for the short-term option while expecting the long-term option to remain stable.

### Time Decay

Horizontal [spreads](../s/spreads.md) are heavily influenced by the rate of [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) of the [options](../o/options.md) involved. In a [long calendar spread](../l/long_calendar_spread.md), for instance, the idea is to benefit from the faster decay of the near-term sold option.

### Underlying Asset Price Movement

The [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price movement can introduce [risk](../r/risk.md) to horizontal [spreads](../s/spreads.md). Although these strategies are primarily based on [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and [time decay](../t/time_decay.md), significant price movement can result in unexpected outcomes, especially in short calendar [spreads](../s/spreads.md).

## Algorithmic Implementation

Incorporating [horizontal spread](../h/horizontal_spread.md) strategies into algorithms involves a few critical steps:

### Market Scanning and Opportunities Identification

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) systems can scan [multiple](../m/multiple.md) [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets to identify potential [horizontal spread](../h/horizontal_spread.md) opportunities. This involves evaluating factors like implied [volatility](../v/volatility.md) discrepancies and [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) rates.

### Option Selection Criteria

The algorithm should be equipped to select the best [options](../o/options.md) for implementing the spread. Criteria may include:

- **[Strike Price](../s/strike_price.md):** Choose [options](../o/options.md) at or near-the-[money](../m/money.md).
- **Expiration Dates:** Define short-term and long-term based on the [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md).
- **[Volatility](../v/volatility.md) Levels:** Identify [volatility](../v/volatility.md) surfaces to pinpoint ideal entry points.

### Execution

Efficient [execution](../e/execution.md) is crucial to minimize [slippage](../s/slippage.md) and [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md). Algorithmic systems can automate the [order](../o/order.md) placement to ensure that both legs of the spread are executed at optimal prices.

### Risk Management

[Risk management](../r/risk_management.md) parameters need to be defined to protect against adverse moves in the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md)'s price or [volatility](../v/volatility.md). This can include setting stop-loss levels, [position sizing](../p/position_sizing.md), and [dynamic hedging](../d/dynamic_hedging.md).

## Advantages

### Leverage Theta Decay

One of the most significant advantages of horizontal [spreads](../s/spreads.md) is the ability to [leverage](../l/leverage.md) [time decay](../t/time_decay.md). By selling near-term [options](../o/options.md) and buying longer-term [options](../o/options.md), traders can construct positions that provide a steady [income](../i/income.md) over time.

### Minimal Initial Investment

Horizontal [spreads](../s/spreads.md) often require a minimal initial investment compared to outright buying or selling [options](../o/options.md) or other [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), making them accessible to various traders.

### Flexibility

These strategies are flexible and can cater to different [market](../m/market.md) conditions, whether a [trader](../t/trader.md) expects [volatility](../v/volatility.md) spikes or significant price movements.

## Disadvantages

### Complexity

Understanding and implementing horizontal [spreads](../s/spreads.md) can be complex, especially for novice traders. It requires a comprehensive understanding of [options](../o/options.md) pricing, [volatility](../v/volatility.md), and [time decay](../t/time_decay.md).

### Potential for Losses

Although designed to [profit](../p/profit.md) from [time decay](../t/time_decay.md), horizontal [spreads](../s/spreads.md) can still incur significant losses, particularly if the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md) experiences unexpected [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

### Execution Risks

Efficient [execution](../e/execution.md) is crucial for the profitability of horizontal [spreads](../s/spreads.md). Poor [execution](../e/execution.md) can result in unwanted [slippage](../s/slippage.md) and [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md), eroding potential gains.

## Real-World Examples

### Case Study 1: Apple Inc. (AAPL)

A [trader](../t/trader.md) implementing a [long calendar spread](../l/long_calendar_spread.md) on Apple might choose the following [options](../o/options.md):
- **Buy 1 AAPL Dec 150 Call**
- **Sell 1 AAPL Oct 150 Call**

In this case, the [trader](../t/trader.md) benefits from the [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) of the October [call option](../c/call_option.md) while maintaining the December [call option](../c/call_option.md).

### Case Study 2: Tesla Inc. (TSLA)

In a short calendar spread scenario for Tesla, a [trader](../t/trader.md) might select:
- **Sell 1 TSLA Dec 400 Put**
- **Buy 1 TSLA Oct 400 Put**

Here, the [trader](../t/trader.md) expects a significant downward movement in Tesla's stock price before the October expiration, aiming to benefit from the difference in [premium](../p/premium.md).

## Conclusion

[Horizontal spread](../h/horizontal_spread.md) strategies [offer](../o/offer.md) traders a way to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on [time decay](../t/time_decay.md) and [volatility](../v/volatility.md) discrepancies between [options](../o/options.md) with the same [strike price](../s/strike_price.md) but different expiration dates. While these strategies can be complex, they provide a flexible and potentially profitable approach for those who understand the intricacies of [options](../o/options.md) trading.

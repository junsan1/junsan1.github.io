# Joint Life with Last Survivor Annuity

A [Joint](../j/joint.md) Life with Last Survivor Annuity is a specific type of annuity contract involving two individuals, typically spouses, that ensures continuous payments until the death of both annuitants. The primary objective of this annuity is to provide financial [security](../s/security.md) for couples in their retirement years. In this detailed overview, we'll explore the structure, benefits, drawbacks, and specific considerations associated with [joint](../j/joint.md) life with last survivor annuities.

## Structure of Joint Life with Last Survivor Annuities

### Annuity Payments
[Joint](../j/joint.md) Life with Last Survivor Annuities guarantee payments that start after the annuitants enter into the agreement. These payments [will](../w/will.md) continue until the last surviving individual passes away, ensuring that the surviving spouse does not face interruption in financial support.

### Premiums and Payouts
The amount of the annuity [premium](../p/premium.md) is generally based on several factors, including the ages, life expectancies, and health conditions of both individuals. Payouts can be structured in various ways, such as level payments, increasing payments, or a combination of other features, depending on specific needs and financial goals.

### Types of Payout Options
1. **Full [Payment](../p/payment.md)**: This option continues to pay the full annuity amount until the death of the second individual.
2. **Half [Payment](../p/payment.md)**: After the first [annuitant](../a/annuitant.md) dies, the [payment](../p/payment.md) might be reduced (e.g., to half), and the reduced amount continues until the second [annuitant](../a/annuitant.md)’s death.
3. **Proportionate [Payment](../p/payment.md)**: Another structure could implement a percentage of the original [payout](../p/payout.md) after the first death (e.g., 75% of the original amount).

## Benefits of Joint Life with Last Survivor Annuities

### Lifetime Income
The primary advantage is guaranteed [income](../i/income.md) for life for both spouses. In a volatile [economy](../e/economy.md) or with the unpredictability of lifespan, this constant source of [income](../i/income.md) is highly valuable for [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md).

### Spousal Security
One spouse often survives the other, especially in the case of older adults. [Joint](../j/joint.md) Life with Last Survivor Annuities ensures that the surviving spouse continues to receive financial support without having to renegotiate or find new investment strategies during a potentially stressful time.

### Tax Benefits
Depending on the jurisdiction, annuities may [offer](../o/offer.md) tax-deferral benefits on investment growth. This means that the [earnings](../e/earnings.md) within the annuity accumulate [tax-deferred](../t/tax_deferred.md) until payments begin, which can be an advantage for retirees seeking to manage their tax liabilities.

### Predictability
Annuities provide a reliable, predictable source of [income](../i/income.md). For retirees who might be worried about [market](../m/market.md) fluctuations impacting their savings, annuities [offer](../o/offer.md) a fixed [hedge](../h/hedge.md) against these uncertainties.

## Drawbacks of Joint Life with Last Survivor Annuities

### Lower Initial Payments
Because the annuity is structured to pay out until the death of the second person, the monthly annuity payments are generally lower compared to single life annuities. The [insurance](../i/insurance.md) company [spreads](../s/spreads.md) the [payout](../p/payout.md) over two lifetimes, which requires a larger reserve of funds to ensure longevity.

### Fixed Payments and Inflation Risk
Some annuities [offer](../o/offer.md) fixed payments, which do not adjust for [inflation](../i/inflation.md). Over time, the [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) of these payments can decrease significantly, potentially affecting the retirees' [standard of living](../s/standard_of_living.md).

### Complexity and Fees
Annuities can be complex financial products with various clauses, terms, and fees that must be understood clearly before entering into an agreement. Surrender charges, administrative fees, and management fees can all affect the overall [payout](../p/payout.md) and returns from the annuity.

### Lack of Flexibility
Once an annuity contract is signed, it can be challenging to alter or terminate without incurring substantial penalties. This inflexibility means that couples must be very certain about their decision to lock away a significant portion of their savings into an annuity.

## Key Considerations

### Life Expectancy
When considering a [joint](../j/joint.md) life with last survivor annuity, it's crucial to evaluate the [life expectancy](../l/life_expectancy.md) of both spouses. This helps determine the appropriate [payout](../p/payout.md) structure and ensures that the annuity serves the intended purpose of lifelong financial [security](../s/security.md).

### Health Status
Health assessments play a significant role in the structuring of these annuities. Couples in good health might find that they get lower monthly payments due to the longer expected [payout](../p/payout.md) period, while those with significant health concerns may face higher payments but with a shorter [payout](../p/payout.md) period.

### Financial Goals
Understanding the couple’s financial goals and overall retirement strategy is paramount. Couples should evaluate how the guaranteed payments fit into their broader [financial plan](../f/financial_plan.md), considering other sources of [income](../i/income.md) and investment strategies.

### Inflation Protection
If [inflation](../i/inflation.md) is a concern, couples might consider an annuity with an [inflation](../i/inflation.md) [rider](../r/rider.md), which adjusts payments based on a specified [index](../i/index_instrument.md) or rate. While this can provide better [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) protection, it often comes with higher initial premiums and potentially lower initial payments.

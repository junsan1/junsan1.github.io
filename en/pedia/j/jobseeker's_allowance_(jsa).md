# Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA)

**Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA)** is a benefit for unemployed individuals in the United Kingdom who are actively seeking work. It provides financial support to help cover living costs while the recipient looks for employment. There are different types of JSA, each with specific eligibility criteria. This comprehensive guide [will](../w/will.md) explore the different types of JSA, eligibility requirements, the application process, and other vital aspects of the allowance.

## Types of Jobseeker's Allowance

There are two main types of Jobseeker's Allowance:

### Contribution-Based JSA
Contribution-Based JSA is available to individuals who have paid enough Class 1 National [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) (NI) contributions over the last two tax years. This form of JSA is not means-tested, meaning that it does not take into account the applicant's [income](../i/income.md) or savings. Key points about Contribution-Based JSA include:
- It is only available for up to 182 days (approximately six months).
- The amount received depends on the applicant's age.
- After 182 days, individuals may need to apply for [income](../i/income.md)-based JSA if they still require financial support.

### Income-Based JSA
[Income](../i/income.md)-Based JSA is designed for individuals who have not paid sufficient National [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) contributions or those who have used up their Contribution-Based JSA entitlement. Unlike Contribution-Based JSA, this type is means-tested, so the applicant's [household income](../h/household_income.md), savings, and [capital](../c/capital.md) are considered when determining eligibility and [payment](../p/payment.md) amounts. Key details include:
- There is no time limit for how long someone can receive [Income](../i/income.md)-Based JSA, provided they meet the eligibility criteria.
- [Payment](../p/payment.md) amounts vary based on the applicant's personal circumstances, including their age, savings, and family situation.

### New Style JSA
New Style JSA is available to individuals who have paid or been credited with sufficient National [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) contributions over the last two to three years. This form of JSA operates similarly to Contribution-Based JSA but is available under the Universal [Credit](../c/credit.md) system. Differences include:
- New Style JSA can be claimed alongside Universal [Credit](../c/credit.md), providing additional financial support.
- It does not affect an individual's potential Universal [Credit](../c/credit.md) payments.
- Eligibility and [payment](../p/payment.md) amounts are assessed independently from other household incomes and savings.

## Eligibility Criteria

To qualify for Jobseeker's Allowance, applicants must meet several eligibility requirements:

### General Eligibility
- The applicant must be aged 18 or over (there are some exceptions for individuals aged 16 or 17).
- They must be under the State Pension age.
- They should not be in full-time education.
- Applicants must reside in the United Kingdom.

### Contribution-Based JSA Eligibility
To be eligible for Contribution-Based JSA, applicants must:
- Have paid or been credited with sufficient Class 1 National [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) contributions for at least two of the last three tax years.

### Income-Based JSA Eligibility
Eligibility for [Income](../i/income.md)-Based JSA is means-tested and depends on:
- The applicant's [household income](../h/household_income.md), including any [income](../i/income.md) from a partner if they live together.
- The applicant's savings and [capital](../c/capital.md).
- The number of hours they work per week (should be fewer than 16 hours for the applicant and fewer than 24 hours for their partner).

### New Style JSA Eligibility
To qualify for New Style JSA, applicants must:
- Have paid or been credited with enough Class 1 National [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) contributions in the two to three tax years preceding their claim.

## Application Process

Applying for Jobseeker's Allowance involves several steps:

### Initial Application
Applicants can apply for JSA online through the GOV.UK website or by phone. The application process includes providing information about the applicant's employment history, education, and personal circumstances. They [will](../w/will.md) need the following documents and information:
- Personal details, including National [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) number and contact information.
- Employment history for the past six months.
- Details of any [income](../i/income.md), savings, and [capital](../c/capital.md).
- [Bank](../b/bank.md) account information for [payment](../p/payment.md) purposes.

### Jobcentre Plus Visit
After submitting the initial application, the applicant [will](../w/will.md) be required to attend an interview at their local Jobcentre Plus office. During this interview, they [will](../w/will.md) discuss their job search activities and create a "Claimant Commitment" agreement, outlining the steps they [will](../w/will.md) take to find work.

### Ongoing Requirements
To continue receiving JSA, claimants must:
- Sign on at the Jobcentre Plus every two weeks to discuss job search progress.
- Actively seek work and demonstrate efforts to find employment.
- Report any changes in circumstances that may affect their eligibility or [payment](../p/payment.md) amounts.

### Sanctions
Failing to meet the requirements of the Claimant Commitment or not actively seeking work can result in sanctions, such as reduced or stopped payments.

## Payment Amounts

The amount of Jobseeker's Allowance an individual receives depends on various factors, including their age and personal circumstances:

### Contribution-Based and New Style JSA
For both Contribution-Based and New Style JSA, the weekly [payment](../p/payment.md) amounts as of April 2023 are:
- £61.05 for individuals aged 18 to 24.
- £77.00 for individuals aged 25 and over.

### Income-Based JSA
[Income](../i/income.md)-Based JSA [payment](../p/payment.md) amounts vary based on the applicant's individual situation, including their savings, [income](../i/income.md), and family circumstances. As a guideline, the maximum weekly amounts as of April 2023 are:
- £61.05 for individuals aged 18 to 24.
- £77.00 for individuals aged 25 and over.
- £121.05 for couples where both partners meet the criteria.

## Interaction with Other Benefits

Jobseeker's Allowance can interact with other benefits in various ways:

### Universal Credit
Individuals can claim New Style JSA alongside Universal [Credit](../c/credit.md). However, the amount of JSA received may affect the Universal [Credit](../c/credit.md) [payment](../p/payment.md), as it counts as [income](../i/income.md).

### Housing Benefit
Claimants of [Income](../i/income.md)-Based JSA may also be eligible for Housing Benefit to help cover rent costs. The eligibility and amount depend on their [income](../i/income.md), savings, and housing situation.

### Child Tax Credit
[Income](../i/income.md)-Based JSA can affect [Child Tax Credit](../c/child_tax_credit.md) entitlements, as JSA payments are considered when calculating the total [household income](../h/household_income.md).

## Additional Support

Jobseeker's Allowance recipients may be entitled to additional support and resources:

### Jobcentre Plus Programs
Jobcentre Plus offers various programs to assist JSA claimants in finding employment, including job search workshops, training courses, and work experience placements.

### Hardship Payments
If a claimant's JSA payments are sanctioned, they may apply for Hardship Payments, which provide reduced financial support during the sanction period.

### Budgeting Loans
Individuals receiving [Income](../i/income.md)-Based JSA may apply for Budgeting Loans to help cover essential expenses, such as housing costs, furniture, and clothing.

### Council Tax Reduction
JSA claimants might be eligible for Council Tax Reduction, which lowers the amount of council tax they need to pay based on their [income](../i/income.md) and savings.

## Conclusion

Jobseeker's Allowance is a crucial financial support system for unemployed individuals actively seeking work in the United Kingdom. Understanding the different types of JSA, eligibility criteria, application processes, and [payment](../p/payment.md) amounts helps ensure that individuals receive the support they need while they look for employment. Additionally, being aware of how JSA interacts with other benefits and the additional support available can provide comprehensive assistance during periods of [unemployment](../u/unemployment.md).

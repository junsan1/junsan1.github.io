## Founding of Tiger Management

In 1980, Julian Robertson founded Tiger Management [Corporation](../c/corporation.md) with $8 million in initial [capital](../c/capital.md). The [firm](../f/firm.md) quickly made a name for itself through a combination of [robust](../r/robust.md) research, aggressive [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), and astute [market](../m/market.md) predictions. Robertson's investment philosophy was centered around the principle of "[long/short equity](../l/long_short_equity.md)," a strategy that involves taking long positions in [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) [stocks](../s/stock.md) while shorting [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md) ones. This approach allowed Tiger Management to [outperform](../o/outperform.md) the [market](../m/market.md) consistently, often yielding annual returns exceeding 30%.

## Investment Philosophy

Robertson's investment philosophy is a blend of rigorous research, [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md), and a keen understanding of macroeconomic trends. He places significant emphasis on the quality of management teams, believing that strong [leadership](../l/leadership.md) is a critical [factor](../f/factor.md) in a company's success. Robertson's approach also involves extensive use of [leverage](../l/leverage.md) to amplify returns, a strategy that requires precise timing and deep [market](../m/market.md) understanding.

## The Tiger Cubs

One of Julian Robertson's most enduring legacies is the cadre of investment managers who started their careers under his mentorship at Tiger Management and later went on to establish their own successful [hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds. These "Tiger Cubs" include notable figures such as Stephen Mandel of Lone Pine [Capital](../c/capital.md), Lee Ainslie of Maverick [Capital](../c/capital.md), and Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors. Collectively, the Tiger Cubs manage billions of dollars in assets, and their success is a testament to the effectiveness of Robertson's mentorship and investment strategies.

### Stephen Mandel

Stephen Mandel founded Lone Pine [Capital](../c/capital.md) in 1997 after leaving Tiger Management.

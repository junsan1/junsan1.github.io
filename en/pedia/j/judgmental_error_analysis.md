# Judgmental Error Analysis

Introduction
------------------
[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), or algo-trading, refers to the use of computer algorithms to automate decision making in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). These algorithms make trading decisions, place orders, and manage them after the [trade](../t/trade.md) is executed. The key advantages of algo-trading include increased speed, accuracy, and reduced costs. However, despite the advantages, [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) can be potentially flawed due to judgmental errors made during [algorithm design](../a/algorithm_design.md) and deployment. Judgmental error analysis is a critical field of study in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) that helps identify, quantify, and mitigate these errors to improve [trading performance](../t/trading_performance.md).

Types of Judgmental Errors
------------------------------
1. **[Overfitting](../o/overfitting.md) and Underfitting**: [Overfitting](../o/overfitting.md) occurs when an algorithm is too closely tailored to historical data, causing it to perform poorly on new data. Underfitting, on the other hand, happens when the model is too simple and cannot capture the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) patterns in the data. Both these errors result in poor predictive performance.

2. **Data Snooping Bias**: This results from excessive use of historical data for model formulation, leading to results that seem significant but are actually not. It often stems from repeated iterations over the same dataset.

3. **[Survivorship Bias](../s/survivorship_bias.md)**: This error arises when only existing assets, those that have "survived," are used for [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md), ignoring those that have failed or been delisted, leading to biased results.

4. **[Look-ahead Bias](../l/look-ahead_bias.md)**: This occurs when future data is inadvertently used to train the model, resulting in an unrealistically optimistic performance during [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md).

5. **Sample Selection Bias**: This arises when the sample data used for model training is not representative of the broader [market](../m/market.md) or data set.

Mitigation Strategies for Judgmental Errors
-----------------------------------------------
1. **Cross-Validation**: To reduce [overfitting](../o/overfitting.md) and underfitting, cross-validation techniques like k-fold validation can be employed. These methods provide a more [robust](../r/robust.md) estimate of a model’s performance on unseen data.

2. **[Out-of-Sample Testing](../o/out-of-sample_testing.md)**: This involves separating a portion of the data as an out-of-sample test set to evaluate the model’s performance on data it hasn’t seen before.

3. **Randomization**: To mitigate data snooping bias, techniques such as data randomization and permutation tests can be useful. They help ensure the robustness of the findings.

4. **Inclusion of Delisted Assets**: To address [survivorship bias](../s/survivorship_bias.md), include data for all assets, including those that have been delisted, when [backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

5. **Time-Matching Data**: Ensure all training data is chronologically consistent, and avoid using any future data points to eliminate [look-ahead bias](../l/look-ahead_bias.md).

Case Studies of Judgmental Error in Algo-Trading
---------------------------------------------------
1. **Long-Term [Capital](../c/capital.md) Management (LTCM)**: This [hedge fund](../h/hedge_fund.md) employed complex [mathematical models](../m/mathematical_models_in_trading.md) for trading. Despite initial success, LTCM collapsed in 1998 due to excessive reliance on overfitted models and inadequate [stress testing](../s/stress_testing_in_trading.md) under extreme [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

2. **Knight [Capital](../c/capital.md) Group**: In 2012, Knight [Capital](../c/capital.md) lost hundreds of millions of dollars within minutes due to a software error stemming from inadequate testing and validation of their trading algorithm.

3. **Flash Crash 2010**: This event saw the Dow Jones plummet nearly 1,000 points within minutes. Analysis revealed that [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) strategies interacting unexpectedly caused this crash, underscoring the importance of [robust](../r/robust.md) error analysis.

Conclusion
--------------
In [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), judgmental errors can significantly impact performance and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md). Continuous error analysis, coupled with [robust](../r/robust.md) testing and validation methods, is crucial for the development of reliable and profitable [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md). Employing [best practices](../b/best_practices.md) such as cross-validation, [out-of-sample testing](../o/out-of-sample_testing.md), and appropriate data usage can mitigate these errors, leading to more accurate and [robust](../r/robust.md) [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

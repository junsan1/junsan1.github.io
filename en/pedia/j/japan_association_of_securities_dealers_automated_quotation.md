# Japan Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation

The Japan Association of Securities Dealers Automated [Quotation](../q/quotation.md), commonly known as JASDAQ, is a prominent securities trading [market](../m/market.md) based in Japan. It operates similarly to the United States' [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md) and serves as a key platform for listing and trading [stocks](../s/stock.md) of emerging and mid-sized companies. JASDAQ plays a significant role in the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) of Japan, [offering](../o/offering.md) a regulated and transparent [exchange](../e/exchange.md) for securities trading.

## History and Evolution

### Origins and Establishment

The origins of JASDAQ can be traced back to the over-the-counter (OTC) [market](../m/market.md) established by the Japan Securities Dealers Association (JSDA) in April 1976. Initially, it was an informal [market](../m/market.md) where transactions were conducted directly between securities dealers and institutional investors without a central marketplace. The need for a more structured and efficient trading system led to the creation of JASDAQ in 1991. This transition marked the formalization of the [market](../m/market.md), bringing increased [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and regulatory oversight.

### Integration with Osaka Securities Exchange

In 2010, JASDAQ underwent a significant transformation when it merged with the Osaka Securities [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (OSE). This integration aimed to streamline operations and enhance the [market](../m/market.md)'s competitiveness. The [merger](../m/merger.md) brought together the technological [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) and regulatory frameworks of both exchanges, resulting in a more [robust](../r/robust.md) and versatile [trading platform](../t/trading_platform.md).

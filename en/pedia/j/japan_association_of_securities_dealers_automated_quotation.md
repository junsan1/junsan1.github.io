# Japan Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation

The Japan Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation, commonly known as JASDAQ, is a prominent securities trading market based in Japan. It operates similarly to the United States' NASDAQ and serves as a key platform for listing and trading stocks of emerging and mid-sized companies. JASDAQ plays a significant role in the financial markets of Japan, offering a regulated and transparent exchange for securities trading.

## History and Evolution

### Origins and Establishment

The origins of JASDAQ can be traced back to the over-the-counter (OTC) market established by the Japan Securities Dealers Association (JSDA) in April 1976. Initially, it was an informal market where transactions were conducted directly between securities dealers and institutional investors without a central marketplace. The need for a more structured and efficient trading system led to the creation of JASDAQ in 1991. This transition marked the formalization of the market, bringing increased transparency and regulatory oversight.

### Integration with Osaka Securities Exchange

In 2010, JASDAQ underwent a significant transformation when it merged with the Osaka Securities Exchange (OSE). This integration aimed to streamline operations and enhance the market's competitiveness. The merger brought together the technological infrastructure and regulatory frameworks of both exchanges, resulting in a more robust and versatile trading platform.

## Market Structure and Trading Mechanisms

Key regulatory bodies include the Japan Securities Dealers Association (JSDA) and the Financial Services Agency (FSA).

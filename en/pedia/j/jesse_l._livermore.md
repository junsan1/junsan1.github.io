# Jesse L. Livermore

Jesse Lauriston Livermore, often referred to as the "Great Bear of [Wall Street](../w/wall_street.md)," was an American stock [trader](../t/trader.md) renowned for his trading acumen, particularly his successful short-selling during times of [market](../m/market.md) turmoil. Livermore was born on July 26, 1877, and through his career, he became one of the most famous stock traders in history due to his larger-than-life personality and the dramatic wins and losses he experienced in the [market](../m/market.md).

## Early Life and Career

Livermore was born in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, and started trading at the young age of 14. His early exposure to the world of [finance](../f/finance.md) came as a teenager working as a chalkboard boy at a brokerage [firm](../f/firm.md). This role required him to update stock prices on the board, providing him with the opportunity to observe [market](../m/market.md) movements closely and learn the basics of trading.

At the age of 15, Livermore began trading on his own account, initially in "bucket shops"—unregulated trading houses where bets were placed on stock prices. Despite their dubious legality, these environments provided him with an excellent training ground for honing his [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

## Major Trading Strategies

### Tape Reading

Livermore was a pioneer in the field of [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md), particularly in the practice of [tape reading](../t/tape_reading.md)—a method of analyzing the price and [volume](../v/volume.md) data from ticker tapes to predict future [market](../m/market.md) movements. He meticulously observed patterns and trends in stock prices and volumes, enabling him to make informed trading decisions.

### Speculative Shorting

One of Livermore's most famous [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) was his practice of [short selling](../s/short_selling.md) during [market](../m/market.md) downturns. He successfully predicted and profited from several major [market](../m/market.md) crashes, including the Panic of 1907 and the [Wall Street](../w/wall_street.md) Crash of 1929. His ability to foresee and [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on [market](../m/market.md) declines earned him a reputation as the "Great Bear of [Wall Street](../w/wall_street.md)."

### Pyramiding

Livermore employed a strategy known as pyramiding, where he would add to his positions as they moved in his favor. By incrementally increasing his stakes, he was able to maximize profits during favorable trends while managing [risk](../r/risk.md) through [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md).

### Timing the Market

Livermore's approach to [market timing](../m/market_timing.md) was based on a keen understanding of [market](../m/market.md) psychology and cyclical trends. He believed that markets moved in predictable cycles and that understanding these cycles was key to successful [speculation](../s/speculation.md).

## Key Trades and Market Crashes

### The Panic of 1907

One of Livermore's most notable successes came during the Panic of 1907. As the [market](../m/market.md) began to unravel, he recognized the signs of impending collapse and initiated substantial short positions. His foresight allowed him to amass significant profits, solidifying his reputation as a master [trader](../t/trader.md).

### The Cotton Trade

In 1919, Livermore made a legendary [trade](../t/trade.md) in the cotton [market](../m/market.md). He took a massive long position based on his analysis of [market](../m/market.md) conditions and [supply](../s/supply.md)-[demand](../d/demand.md) dynamics. The [market](../m/market.md) moved in his favor, resulting in substantial profits. This [trade](../t/trade.md) was so significant that it drew the attention of President Woodrow Wilson, who intervened to stabilize prices.

### The Wall Street Crash of 1929

Perhaps the most famous of Livermore's trades was his short position during the [Wall Street](../w/wall_street.md) Crash of 1929. Leading up to the crash, he observed overvaluation in the [market](../m/market.md) and increasing economic instability. He took substantial short positions, and when the [market](../m/market.md) finally collapsed, he reaped colossal gains. This [trade](../t/trade.md) reportedly earned him around $100 million, an astronomical sum at the time.

## Personal Life and Legacy

### Financial Ups and Downs

Despite his remarkable successes, Livermore's trading career was marked by several dramatic financial reversals. He experienced numerous bankruptcies and periods of [financial distress](../f/financial_distress.md), often as a result of over-[leverage](../l/leverage.md) and [market](../m/market.md) miscalculations. His personal life was also tumultuous, with [multiple](../m/multiple.md) marriages and family tragedies.

### Influence on Modern Trading

Jesse Livermore's impact on the field of trading and [speculation](../s/speculation.md) is profound. His trading philosophies and methods have influenced generations of traders. Key principles from his strategies, such as [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), [market timing](../m/market_timing.md), and [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md), are still widely studied and applied today.

### Publications

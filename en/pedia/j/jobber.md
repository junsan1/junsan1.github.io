# Jobber

Jobbing, or "[scalping](../s/scalping.md)" as it is often called in the financial trading world, is a rapid-fire trading style that involves taking advantage of small price discrepancies within very short time frames. The practitioners of this art are known as jobbers. Jobbers are mainly focused on capturing small profits that can accumulate into significant returns over time through a high [volume](../v/volume.md) of trades. While jobbing is commonly associated with stock markets, it is also prevalent in other [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) such as commodities, Forex, and [options](../o/options.md).

## Definition and Role

Jobbers operate under a unique set of rules and exhibit behaviors that differentiate them from other types of traders. They look for highly [liquid](../l/liquid.md) markets, quick [execution](../e/execution.md) times, and low [spreads](../s/spreads.md). This trading style is characterized by a large number of trades executed in a single day, with each [trade](../t/trade.md) aiming for small price changes. A jobberâ€™s goal is to take advantage of the [bid-ask spread](../b/bid-ask_spread.md) or to [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on short-term [market](../m/market.md) inefficiencies.

### Characteristics of Jobbers

1. **High Frequency**: Jobbers might execute hundreds or even thousands of trades in a single day.
2. **Small Price Movements**: They aim to [profit](../p/profit.md) from minor price fluctuations, often a few cents per share or points in case of indices.
3. **Short Holding Periods**: Positions are held for very brief periods, sometimes just seconds or minutes.
4. **[Technical Analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md)**: They rely heavily on [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) and charts to time their trades.
5. **[Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)**: A jobber ensures that there is sufficient [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) to enter and exit trades rapidly without large price impacts.

## Tools and Techniques

To excel in jobbing, traders employ a variety of tools and techniques designed to maximize speed and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md):

### Advanced Trading Platforms

Jobbers require [robust](../r/robust.md), high-speed trading platforms that allow for rapid [order](../o/order.md) [execution](../e/execution.md) and provide real-time data. These platforms often feature:
- **Level II [Market](../m/market.md) Data**: Provides insight into the [market depth](../m/market_depth.md) and the [order book](../o/order_book.md).
- **Hot Keys**: Enables quick [order](../o/order.md) placements and cancellations.
- **Customizable Interfaces**: Tailored dashboards and tools for quick analysis.

### Algorithms and Automation

Many jobbers utilize [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) to [handle](../h/handle.md) the speed and [volume](../v/volume.md) of trades. These algorithms scan the [market](../m/market.md) for predefined triggers and execute trades at electronic speeds. Features include:
- **Latency Monitoring**: Ensuring trades are executed with minimal delay.
- **[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md)**: Evaluating the performance of [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md) using historical data.
- **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Integrated tools for managing exposure and [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md).

### Technical Indicators

Jobbers often rely on a suite of [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicator.md) to guide their trades. Some commonly used indicators include:
- **Moving Averages**: Helps in identifying trending markets or mean-reversion opportunities.
- **[Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_band.md)**: Assists in spotting [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and [overbought](../o/overbought.md)/[oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions.
- **[Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (RSI)**: Measures the speed and change of price movements.

### Market Research

Even though [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md) plays a minimal role in jobbing due to its short-term nature, jobbers keep an eye on [market](../m/market.md) news, [economic indicators](../e/economic_indicators.md), and announcements that could impact [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

## Challenges

Jobbing is not without its challenges and risks. Some of the primary challenges include:

### Transaction Costs

The high-frequency nature of jobbing results in a significant number of trades, leading to substantial [transaction costs](../t/transaction_costs.md). These can erode overall profitability if not managed correctly.

### Slippage

[Slippage](../s/slippage.md) occurs when there is a difference between the expected price of a [trade](../t/trade.md) and the actual executed price. In fast-moving markets, this can be a significant [issue](../i/issue.md) for jobbers.

### Emotional Stress

The fast-paced environment and the necessity for quick decision-making can lead to significant emotional stress. Jobbers need to maintain a high level of discipline and focus.

### Market Access and Technology

Staying competitive as a jobber requires access to the latest technology and [market](../m/market.md) data feeds, which can be costly. Additionally, maintaining a low-latency [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) is crucial.

## Prominent Jobbers and Firms

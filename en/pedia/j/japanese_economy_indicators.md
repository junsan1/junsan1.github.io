## Introduction
Japan, the world's third-largest economy, has a complex and highly developed economic system.

### Importance in Japan:
Japan's GDP highlights the country's productivity, economic growth, and living standards. Given Japan's significant role in global trade, its GDP figures can influence global market trends.

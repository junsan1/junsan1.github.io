## Rating Methodology
JCR employs a meticulous and multifaceted approach to credit rating. Its methodology combines both quantitative and qualitative analyses, which are crucial in evaluating an entity’s ability to repay its debt obligations. The methodology generally encompasses:

1. **Financial Analysis**: This includes the examination of financial statements, liquidity ratios, profitability ratios, leverage, and cash flow analyses.
  
2. **Business Analysis**: Evaluation of the entity's business model, industry position, market share, competitive landscape, and management effectiveness.
  
3. **Economic Environment**: Assessment of macroeconomic conditions, interest rates, regulatory changes, and geopolitical factors that could affect the entity's financial health.
  
4. **Corporate Governance and Management**: Evaluation of the company's governance structure, ethics, and the experience and competency of its management team.

JCR’s ratings range from AAA, which represents the highest level of creditworthiness, to D, indicating default. Intermediate ratings such as AA, A, and BBB denote varying degrees of credit quality and risk.

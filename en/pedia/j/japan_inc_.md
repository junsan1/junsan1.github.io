# Japan Inc.

"Japan Inc." is a colloquialism that originated in the 1980s to describe the close relationship between Japan's [business](../b/business.md) sector, its [bureaucracy](../b/bureaucracy.md), and its political system. This term captures the collaborative and intertwined nature of corporate strategies, [government policies](../g/government_policies_in_trading.md), and economic planning that powered Japan's rapid post-WWII growth and industrial success.

## Historical Context

Post-World War II, Japan was in a state of economic devastation. However, through a combination of [government policies](../g/government_policies_in_trading.md), industrial reforms, and cultural attitudes towards work and innovation, Japan experienced what is often referred to as the "Japanese Economic Miracle." During this period, the country's GDP grew rapidly, transforming it into one of the world's largest economies.

### Keiretsu System

One of the key components of Japan Inc. is the "[Keiretsu](../k/keiretsu.md)" system. [Keiretsu](../k/keiretsu.md) refers to a set of companies with interlocking [business](../b/business.md) relationships and shareholdings. The main goal of this system is to reduce risks from financial [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) and improve the competitiveness of the companies involved by fostering mutual support and cooperation.

Two types of [Keiretsu](../k/keiretsu.md) exist:
- **Horizontal [Keiretsu](../k/keiretsu.md)**: Centred around a core [bank](../b/bank.md), which offers financial backing and acts as a stabilizing element among the group.
- **Vertical [Keiretsu](../k/keiretsu.md)**: Typically dominated by a single [parent company](../p/parent_company.md) and often involve a large manufacturer and its various suppliers and distributors.

An example of Horizontal [Keiretsu](../k/keiretsu.md) is the "Mitsubishi Group," and a quintessential Vertical [Keiretsu](../k/keiretsu.md) is "Toyota Group."

### Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)

The Ministry of International [Trade](../t/trade.md) and [Industry](../i/industry.md) (MITI) played a pivotal role in Japan's economic transformation. Established in 1949, MITI was responsible for coordinating efforts between the Japanese government and private [industry](../i/industry.md). 

Some key functions of MITI included:
- **Industrial Policy**: Guiding industries towards certain sectors deemed strategically important, [offering](../o/offering.md) subsidies, and providing [guidance](../g/guidance.md).
- **[Trade](../t/trade.md) Promotion**: Negotiating [trade](../t/trade.md) agreements and promoting exports.
- **Regulation and De-regulation**: Implementing regulations to protect nascent industries and later removing these protections as industries became competitive globally.

## Economic Practices

Japan Inc. embodies several distinct economic practices that closely tie [government policies](../g/government_policies_in_trading.md) to corporate strategies.

### Lifetime Employment

A significant feature of Japan Inc. is the practice of lifetime employment, especially prevalent in large, established corporations. Under this system, employees are hired directly after completing their education and remain with a company until retirement. This practice engenders deep corporate loyalty and enables companies to heavily invest in training and development, fostering innovation and efficient processes.

### Ringi System

The Ringi system is the traditional Japanese decision-making process involving consensus-building. All stakeholders participate in drafting, revising, and agreeing on decisions, typically documented in a "ringi-sho" (approval drafts). This ensures that decisions, once made, have broad organizational support and can be implemented effectively without resistance.

### Just-In-Time Manufacturing (Kaizen)

Industries, particularly automobile [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md), adopted the Just-in-Time (JIT) [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) system. Toyota, a pioneer in this regard, developed the Toyota Production System (TPS), which organizes [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) to reduce waste and improve [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md). 

Key principles include:
- **Right-on-Time [Inventory](../i/inventory.md)**: Reducing storage costs by receiving goods only as they are needed in the production process.
- **Continuous Improvement ([Kaizen](../k/kaizen.md))**: Constantly seeking incremental improvements in processes.

### Quality Control Circles (QCCs)

QCCs are small groups of employees who meet regularly to discuss and solve work-related problems. This practice, encouraged by management, fosters a culture of continuous improvement and employee participation in the decision-making process.

## Evolution and Challenges

While the term "Japan Inc." highlights the successes of the Japanese [economy](../e/economy.md), it also reflects certain challenges that have emerged over time.

### Economic Stagnation

Since the burst of the [asset](../a/asset.md) bubble in the early 1990s, Japan Inc. has faced prolonged economic [stagnation](../s/stagnation.md), with [deflation](../d/deflation.md), slow growth, and mounting public [debt](../d/debt.md). The close-knit relationships between businesses, banks, and the government have sometimes led to an unproductive allocation of resources.

### Aging Population

Japan's aging population is another significant challenge. With one of the world's highest [life expectancy](../l/life_expectancy.md) rates and low birth rates, the workforce is shrinking, and the burden on [social security](../s/social_security.md) systems is increasing. Companies and the government are now looking for ways to adapt to this demographic shift, including encouraging higher female workforce participation and extending the retirement age.

## Modern Adaptations

To stay competitive on the global stage, Japan Inc. has been adapting. Some of these modern adaptations include:

### Corporate Governance Reforms

Recent years have seen efforts to improve [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md). Reforms include introducing independent directors to corporate boards, increasing [transparency](../t/transparency.md), and prioritizing [shareholder value](../s/shareholder_value.md).

### Technological Innovation

Japan continues to be a global leader in robotics, [artificial intelligence](../a/artificial_intelligence_in_trading.md), and advanced [manufacturing](../m/manufacturing.md) technologies. Companies are increasingly focusing on R&D to create high-[value](../v/value.md) products and services.

### International Expansion

Japanese companies have been expanding their international presence through mergers, acquisitions, and partnerships. This international [diversification](../d/diversification.md) helps mitigate domestic [market](../m/market.md) limitations and captures growing [market](../m/market.md) opportunities abroad.

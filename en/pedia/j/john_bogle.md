# John Bogle

John Clifton Bogle, commonly known as Jack Bogle, was an influential figure in the field of [investment management](../i/investment_management.md). He was the founder and chief executive of The Vanguard Group, which is now one of the largest and most respected [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md) companies in the world. His investment philosophy, which emphasized low costs and long-term [investing](../i/investing.md) in broad-based [index](../i/index.md) funds, has left a lasting legacy.

### Early Life and Education

John Bogle was born on May 8, 1929, in Montclair, New Jersey. He attended Blair Academy, a private boarding school in New Jersey, where he excelled academically. He later enrolled at Princeton University, where he wrote a senior thesis that would lay the groundwork for his future career. The thesis, titled "The Economic Role of the [Investment Company](../i/investment_company.md)," argued that most mutual funds underperformed the broader [market](../m/market.md) due to high fees and [active management](../a/active_management.md) failures.

### Career Beginnings

After graduating from Princeton in 1951, Bogle began his career in [investment management](../i/investment_management.md) at Wellington Management Company. He quickly climbed the ranks, becoming president of the [firm](../f/firm.md) in 1967. However, a series of poor decisions led to his dismissal in 1974. This setback turned out to be a blessing in disguise, as it led Bogle to found The Vanguard Group.

### Founding of The Vanguard Group

In 1975, Bogle launched The Vanguard Group with a revolutionary idea: creating a [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md) that would simply track the [market](../m/market.md) rather than trying to beat it. This concept was rooted in his belief that over the long term, low-cost [index](../i/index.md) funds would [outperform](../o/outperform.md) actively managed funds due to lower fees and the inefficiencies inherent in trying to predict [market](../m/market.md) movements.

### The Birth of Index Funds

The first [index fund](../i/index_fund.md) offered by Vanguard was the First [Index](../i/index.md) Investment [Trust](../t/trust.md), launched in 1975. This [fund](../f/fund.md), later renamed the Vanguard 500 [Index Fund](../i/index_fund.md), aimed to track the performance of the S&P 500, a broad [index](../i/index.md) of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States. Initially, the idea was met with skepticism and even ridicule from [Wall Street](../w/wall_street.md), but over time, the benefits of low-cost [passive investing](../p/passive_investing.md) became evident.

### Bogle's Investment Philosophy

John Bogle's investment philosophy can be summarized by a few key principles:

1. **Low Costs:** High fees and expenses eat into investment returns. By keeping costs low, investors can retain more of their returns.
   
2. **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md):** Spreading investments across a wide array of assets can reduce [risk](../r/risk.md). Bogle championed broad-based [index](../i/index.md) funds for their inherent [diversification](../d/diversification.md).

3. **Long-Term Perspective:** [Market timing](../m/market_timing.md) and [short-term trading](../s/short-term_trading.md) often lead to suboptimal results. Bogle believed in holding investments for the long term.

4. **Simplicity:** Complex investment strategies often lead to confusion and poor outcomes. Bogle advocated for straightforward, easy-to-understand investment approaches.

### Impact on the Investment Industry

Bogle's ideas revolutionized the investment [industry](../i/industry.md). Today, [index](../i/index.md) funds account for a significant portion of the assets under management in mutual funds and ETFs. His focus on low costs has also led to a broader [industry](../i/industry.md) [trend](../t/trend.md) of [fee](../f/fee.md) reductions, benefiting investors worldwide.

### Books and Writings

Bogle was a prolific [writer](../w/writer.md) and speaker. Some of his most influential books include:

- **"Common Sense on Mutual Funds"** (1999): A comprehensive guide to [mutual fund](../m/mutual_fund.md) [investing](../i/investing.md), covering various aspects of [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md) and [fund](../f/fund.md) management.
  
- **"The Little Book of Common Sense [Investing](../i/investing.md)"** (2007): A concise introduction to Bogle's investment philosophy, emphasizing the importance of low-cost [index](../i/index.md) funds.

- **"Enough: True Measures of [Money](../m/money.md), [Business](../b/business.md), and Life"** (2008): A reflection on the broader implications of [wealth](../w/wealth.md) and the importance of ethical behavior in [business](../b/business.md).

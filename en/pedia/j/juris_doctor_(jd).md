The Juris Doctor (JD) is a professional degree in law, primarily found in the United States, Canada, Australia, and other common law countries. It is intended to prepare students to practice law, providing them with the foundational legal knowledge and practical skills required to pass a bar examination and engage in legal practice. The JD degree originated in the United States in the late 19th century as a way to standardize legal education and professionalize law as a career.

## Admission Requirements

Admission to a JD program typically requires:

1. **Completion of an Undergraduate Degree**: Most JD programs require applicants to hold a bachelor's degree. The specific field of study is generally not important, though some fields may offer better preparation for the rigors of law school.
2. **Law School Admission Test (LSAT) Scores**: The LSAT is a standardized test designed to assess reading comprehension, logical, and verbal reasoning proficiencies. Many law schools use it as a key part of their admissions process.
3. **Personal Statement**: Applicants must usually submit a personal statement that outlines their motivations for pursuing a legal career, their background, and any other pertinent information.
4. **Letters of Recommendation**: Typically from professors, employers, or other professionals who can vouch for the applicant's qualifications and readiness for law school.

## Accreditation and Licensing

In the United States, the American Bar Association (ABA) accredits JD programs, ensuring that they meet established standards of quality and rigor. Graduates of ABA-accredited law schools are typically eligible to sit for the bar exam in any state. 

## The JD in Practice

Upon earning a JD, graduates must pass the bar examination in the jurisdiction where they wish to practice. The bar exam tests knowledge of general legal principles and specific laws relevant to the jurisdiction. After passing the bar exam, lawyers must also meet other licensure requirements, such as passing a character and fitness assessment.

Common career paths for JD graduates include:

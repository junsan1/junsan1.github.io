# Jumbo Loan

A jumbo [loan](../l/loan.md) is a type of [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) [loan](../l/loan.md) that exceeds the limits set by the Federal Housing [Finance](../f/finance.md) Agency (FHFA). As of 2023, the conforming [loan](../l/loan.md) limit for a single-family [home](../h/home.md) is $726,200 across most of the United States, but it can be higher in areas with more expensive [real estate](../r/real_estate.md). Jumbo loans are used to [finance](../f/finance.md) luxury properties and homes in highly competitive [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) markets, and they come with unique [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) requirements and tax implications.

## Definition of a Jumbo Loan

A jumbo [loan](../l/loan.md) is a non-conforming [loan](../l/loan.md) because it doesn't conform to the FHFA's [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) limits. This type of [loan](../l/loan.md) is used when the purchase price of a [home](../h/home.md) exceeds the limits for conventional loans. Here are the primary characteristics of jumbo loans:

- **Higher [Loan](../l/loan.md) Amounts**: Jumbo loans allow for borrowing more than the conforming [loan](../l/loan.md) limits.
- **Strict [Credit](../c/credit.md) Requirements**: Due to the larger [loan](../l/loan.md) amounts and increased [risk](../r/risk.md) to the [lender](../l/lender.md), applicants typically need higher [credit](../c/credit.md) scores.
- **Diverse Usage**: Although commonly associated with luxury properties, jumbo loans can be utilized for refinancing existing mortgages or for investment properties.
- **Increased Down Payments**: Borrowers are often required to make larger down payments, sometimes as high as 20% or more.
- **More Rigorous [Income](../i/income.md) Verification**: Proof of higher [income](../i/income.md) and substantial assets are typically necessary to qualify.

## Differences Between Conforming and Jumbo Loans

The key difference between conforming loans and jumbo loans lies in the amount being borrowed and the [underwriting standards](../u/underwriting_standards.md). While conforming loans adhere to the limits and guidelines set by [Freddie Mac](../f/freddie_mac.md) and Fannie Mae, jumbo loans do not, and thus they pose a higher [risk](../r/risk.md) to lenders, requiring them to implement stricter qualification criteria.

### Conforming Loans

- Set by FHFA guidelines.
- Easier qualification process.
- Often come with lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.
- Lower [down payment](../d/down_payment.md) requirements.
- Generally subject to less stringent [income](../i/income.md) verification.

### Jumbo Loans

- Exceed FHFA limits.
- More challenging to qualify for due to stricter [credit](../c/credit.md) requirements.
- Typically higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.
- Higher [down payment](../d/down_payment.md) and [reserve requirements](../r/reserve_requirements.md).
- More detailed [income](../i/income.md) and [asset](../a/asset.md) documentation.

## Qualification Criteria for Jumbo Loans

Due to their non-conforming nature, the qualification criteria for jumbo loans are more rigorous compared to conventional loans. The following are the standard criteria set by most lenders:

### Credit Score
A higher [credit score](../c/credit_score.md) is usually required. While conforming loans may allow for [credit](../c/credit.md) scores as low as 620, jumbo loans typically require a score of at least 700, often going higher to 720 or even 740 to secure the [loan](../l/loan.md).

### Debt-To-Income Ratio (DTI)
Jumbo [loan](../l/loan.md) applicants usually need a lower [debt](../d/debt.md)-to-[income](../i/income.md) ratio, generally capped at 38% to 43%, as opposed to the higher ratios sometimes allowed for conforming loans.

### Down Payment
Lenders often require higher down payments for jumbo loans. A [down payment](../d/down_payment.md) of 20% is common, but in highly competitive markets or for borrowers with borderline qualifications, the required [down payment](../d/down_payment.md) can be significantly higher.

### Income Proof
Lenders [will](../w/will.md) require detailed [income](../i/income.md) proof to ensure that the borrower can [handle](../h/handle.md) larger monthly payments. This includes tax returns, W-2 forms, pay stubs, and other [income](../i/income.md) documentation.

### Cash Reserves
Borrowers might need to have cash reserves equivalent to several months of [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) payments. This can [range](../r/range.md) from 6 months to up to 18 months of payments, depending on the [lender](../l/lender.md)'s requirements.

### Property Appraisal
Since jumbo loans are used to [finance](../f/finance.md) high-[value](../v/value.md) properties, lenders often require [multiple](../m/multiple.md) appraisals to determine the property's [market value](../m/market_value.md) accurately.

## Benefits of Jumbo Loans

Despite the stricter requirements, there are several benefits of choosing a jumbo [loan](../l/loan.md):

- **Higher [Loan](../l/loan.md) Limits**: The primary benefit is the ability to borrow larger sums of [money](../m/money.md) for high-cost properties.
- **Potentially Competitive Rates**: With excellent [credit](../c/credit.md) and significant proof of [income](../i/income.md), some borrowers may obtain competitive [interest](../i/interest.md) rates.
- **Flexibility in Property Type**: Jumbo loans can be used for various property types, including primary residences, secondary homes, and investment properties.
- **Custom [Loan](../l/loan.md) Terms**: Borrowers can often negotiate custom [loan](../l/loan.md) terms that better fit their financial situations.
  
## Drawbacks of Jumbo Loans

While jumbo loans provide access to significant borrowing amounts, they come with certain drawbacks:

- **Higher [Interest](../i/interest.md) Rates**: Due to the higher [risk](../r/risk.md) for lenders, jumbo loans often come with higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates compared to conventional loans.
- **Larger Down Payments**: Borrowers need to have substantial funds available for a [down payment](../d/down_payment.md), which can be a barrier for some.
- **Stricter Qualification Measures**: The rigorous qualification standards mean that not all borrowers [will](../w/will.md) be eligible for jumbo loans.
- **[Market](../m/market.md) Sensitivity**: The property values for which jumbo loans are issued can be more affected by [market](../m/market.md) fluctuations.

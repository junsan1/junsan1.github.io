# Jerome Kerviel

Jerome Kerviel is a name that resonates in the financial world, particularly in the context of high-stakes trading and [financial risk management](../f/financial_risk_management.md). Born on January 11, 1977, in Pont-l'Abbé, Brittany, France, Kerviel is a former [trader](../t/trader.md) who gained notoriety for his role in one of the largest trading losses in history while working for Société Générale.

## Early Life and Education

Kerviel was born into a modest family; his mother was a hairdresser, and his father was a metalworker. He showed academic promise early on, leading him to pursue higher education in the field of [finance](../f/finance.md). He graduated from Lumière University Lyon 2 with a master's degree in [Finance](../f/finance.md) and received additional degrees in Organizational and Control Systems.

## Career at Société Générale

Jerome Kerviel joined Société Générale (SocGen) in 2000. He was initially employed in the [bank](../b/bank.md)’s compliance department, focusing on [risk control](../r/risk_control.md) procedures. In 2005, he transitioned to the [bank](../b/bank.md)’s [Delta](../d/delta.md) One [trading desk](../t/trading_desk.md) in Paris, where he was responsible for [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), hedging, and trading ETFs, [futures](../f/futures.md), and other [derivative](../d/derivative.md) products.

## The Scandal

### The Strategy

By the time the case unfolded in January 2008, Kerviel had engaged in sophisticated [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). His main trading activities involved [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md)—taking advantage of price discrepancies between different markets to make a [profit](../p/profit.md). However, he began taking larger and unauthorized positions in European [index futures](../i/index_futures.md).

### Uncovering the Losses

Kerviel's activities were discovered in January 2008, when Société Générale revealed that he had accumulated unauthorized trading positions amounting to approximately €49.9 billion—far exceeding the [bank](../b/bank.md)'s [market value](../m/market_value.md). The [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md) of these positions resulted in a staggering €4.9 billion loss for Société Générale.

### Techniques and Methods

Kerviel used several techniques to bypass Société Générale’s [risk management systems](../r/risk_management_systems.md):
- **Fictitious Transactions:** Entered fake trades to [offset](../o/offset.md) real trades and deceive [risk](../r/risk.md) controls.
- **Unauthorized Positions:** Took large positions beyond his authorized limits.
- **Backdating Trades:** Manipulated [trade](../t/trade.md) dates to balance profits and losses at favorable times.

### Risk Management Failures

The incident highlighted significant lapses in Société Générale's [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) framework. Kerviel's ability to circumvent controls was attributed to inadequate supervision and a lack of [robust](../r/robust.md) internal [checks and balances](../c/checks_and_balances.md). Several questions arose regarding:
- **Compliance Procedures:** How Kerviel managed to input fake trades undetected.
- **Supervisory Oversight:** The failure of supervisors to scrutinize trading behavior.
- **Technological Safeguards:** Inadequacies in automated systems designed to flag unusual activities.

### Legal Repercussions

In 2010, Kerviel was convicted by a French court of breach of [trust](../t/trust.md), forgery, and unauthorized use of [bank](../b/bank.md) computers. He was sentenced to five years in prison, with two years suspended, and was ordered to repay the €4.9 billion in losses. However, the impracticality of the restitution amount led to further legal revisions.

## Impact on Société Générale

The financial blow from Kerviel's activities had several lasting impacts on Société Générale, affecting its financial standing, regulatory environment, and reputation.

### Financial Consequences

The immediate financial impact was profound. Société Générale's stock price plummeted, and the loss necessitated an urgent [recapitalization](../r/recapitalization.md) plan. The [bank](../b/bank.md) raised approximately €5.5 billion through a rights [issue](../i/issue.md), diluting [shareholder value](../s/shareholder_value.md) but restoring [market](../m/market.md) confidence.

### Regulatory Changes

In response to the scandal, regulatory authorities worldwide scrutinized existing [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) practices. Changes included:
- **Stricter Controls:** Enhanced surveillance measures and stricter compliance protocols.
- **[Transparency](../t/transparency.md) Requirements:** Greater [transparency](../t/transparency.md) in reporting and [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) practices.
- **[Risk Management Frameworks](../r/risk_management_frameworks.md):** Strengthened frameworks incorporating both human oversight and automated controls.

### Reputational Damage

The scandal inflicted considerable reputational damage on Société Générale, eroding client [trust](../t/trust.md) and impacting the [bank](../b/bank.md)’s standing in the international financial community. Efforts to restore confidence involved extensive public relations campaigns and initiatives to demonstrate systemic resilience.

## Post-Conviction Life

Following his conviction, Jerome Kerviel has maintained a public profile. He has written a book, "L'Engrenage: Mémoirs d'un [Trader](../t/trader.md)," detailing his perspective on the incident and has participated in various media interviews. Kerviel has also expressed a contrarian view, alleging that the [bank](../b/bank.md) was partially complicit in his actions—a claim denied by Société Générale.

### Advocacy and Public Speaking

Kerviel has engaged in advocacy, often speaking on issues related to:
- **Financial Ethics:** Promoting ethical practices in trading.
- **Regulation and Oversight:** Calling for more [robust](../r/robust.md) oversight mechanisms.
- **[Bank](../b/bank.md) Accountability:** Criticizing institutional shortcomings that enable risky behaviors.

## Broader Implications

The Jerome Kerviel case serves as a cautionary tale in the financial world, illustrating the catastrophic potential of inadequate [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) and [internal controls](../i/internal_controls.md). The incident has prompted broader reflections on the need for:
- **Holistic [Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md):** Comprehensive strategies that encompass both technical and ethical dimensions.
- **Cultural Reforms:** A shift towards a culture of accountability and [transparency](../t/transparency.md) in financial institutions.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Ongoing enhancements in regulatory frameworks to keep pace with evolving [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md).

## Conclusion

Jerome Kerviel's story is a complex and multi-faceted narrative that continues to [hold](../h/hold.md) relevance in discussions about [financial risk](../f/financial_risk.md), ethics, and regulation. While his actions had devastating consequences, they have also catalyzed significant changes in the way financial institutions operate, underscoring the critical importance of [robust](../r/robust.md) [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) and ethical vigilance in trading environments.

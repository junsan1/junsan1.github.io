# Jitney

In the context of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) and algo trading, a "jitney" refers to an arrangement where a member of a stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md) executes trades on behalf of a non-member, who in turn has clients that are either retail or institutional investors. This concept is particularly significant in understanding the mechanisms that facilitate [trade](../t/trade.md) [execution](../e/execution.md), [liquidity provision](../l/liquidity_provision.md), and [market](../m/market.md) access for traders who may not have direct membership within an [exchange](../e/exchange.md).

## Background and Historical Context

The term "jitney" has its origins in early 20th century American slang, where it was used to reference a small coin, such as a nickel, and later to inexpensive modes of transportation. In [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), the concept evolved to describe a service where smaller brokerage firms, which are not members of the stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md), rely on member firms to execute trades on their behalf. This practice was particularly prevalent during the mid-20th century, when the barriers to becoming a member of a stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md) were significantly higher.

## Mechanism of Jitney Trading

Jitney trading involves a contractual relationship between a member [firm](../f/firm.md) and a non-member [firm](../f/firm.md). The non-member [firm](../f/firm.md) directs orders from its clients to the member [firm](../f/firm.md), which then executes these orders on the stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md). This service is distinct from other forms of [brokerage services](../b/brokerage_services.md) as it involves a formal arrangement that allows the non-member to access the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) via the memberâ€™s membership rights.

### Process Overview:

1. **[Order](../o/order.md) Initiation**: The non-member [firm](../f/firm.md) receives a trading [order](../o/order.md) from its client.
2. **[Order](../o/order.md) Passing**: The non-member [firm](../f/firm.md) forwards the [order](../o/order.md) to the member [firm](../f/firm.md).
3. **[Trade](../t/trade.md) [Execution](../e/execution.md)**: The member [firm](../f/firm.md) executes the [order](../o/order.md) on the stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md) using its membership privileges.
4. **Confirmation and Settlement**: The executed [trade](../t/trade.md) is confirmed and settled, with all records and confirmations passed back to the original client through the non-member [firm](../f/firm.md).

## Advantages of Jitney Trading

1. **[Market](../m/market.md) Access**: Jitney trading allows non-member firms to provide their clients with access to larger exchanges without needing to become full members themselves.
2. **Cost [Efficiency](../e/efficiency.md)**: For smaller firms, the costs associated with becoming a member of a stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md) can be prohibitive. Utilizing a jitney arrangement can significantly reduce these overheads.
3. **Client Retention**: It allows non-member firms to maintain a [robust](../r/robust.md) service [offering](../o/offering.md), thereby retaining their client base without the need to invest heavily in [exchange](../e/exchange.md) membership.

## Regulatory Considerations

Given the complex nature of [trade](../t/trade.md) [execution](../e/execution.md) through jitney arrangements, there are significant regulatory considerations to ensure [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and fairness in the trading process. Regulatory bodies such as the Financial [Industry](../i/industry.md) Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in the United States have established rules to govern jitney trading practices.

### Key Regulatory Aspects:

1. **[Disclosure](../d/disclosure.md)**: Clear [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) to clients about jitney arrangements and the involvement of third-party member firms in the [execution](../e/execution.md) process.
2. **Best [Execution](../e/execution.md)**: Member firms involved in jitney trading must adhere to best [execution](../e/execution.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md), ensuring that trades are executed at the most favorable terms for the client.
3. **Suitability and [Due Diligence](../d/due_diligence.md)**: Firms must maintain rigorous [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md) processes to ensure that jitney counterparts are compliant with relevant regulatory standards.

## Modern Implications and Technology Integration

With the advent of electronic trading platforms and advancements in financial technology, the traditional concept of jitney trading has evolved. Contemporary algorithms and FinTech solutions have streamlined the process, integrating sophisticated [order routing](../o/order_routing.md) and [execution algorithms](../e/execution_algorithms.md) that facilitate direct [market](../m/market.md) access (DMA) without the need for traditional jitney arrangements.

### Technological Advancements:

1. **[Algorithmic Trading](../a/accountability.md)**: Algorithms can smartly route orders to exchanges that [offer](../o/offer.md) the best prices and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), minimizing the need for intermediary member firms.
2. **Direct [Market](../m/market.md) Access (DMA)**: DMA platforms enable non-member firms to access exchanges electronically, reducing reliance on traditional jitney arrangements.
3. **[Blockchain](../b/blockchain_in_trading.md) and Distributed Ledger Technologies**: These technologies promise increased [transparency](../t/transparency.md) and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) in [trade](../t/trade.md) [execution](../e/execution.md) and settlement processes, potentially transforming traditional jitney trading frameworks.

## Conclusion

Jitney trading plays a vital role in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) by enabling smaller brokerage firms to access major stock exchanges through member firms. While the traditional mechanisms of jitney trading have evolved with technological advancements, the foundational principles remain integral to how [market](../m/market.md) access and [trade](../t/trade.md) [execution](../e/execution.md) are facilitated. Understanding jitney trading is crucial for appreciating the complexities of [market](../m/market.md) interactions and the technology driving modern [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

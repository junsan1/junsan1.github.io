# Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS) 

The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act) is a piece of U.S. legislation that was signed into law by President Barack Obama on April 5, 2012. The primary aim of the act is to encourage funding for small businesses by easing various securities regulations. The JOBS Act was meant to facilitate the growth of startups and small businesses by improving their access to capital markets. To understand its full implications, let’s delve into the core concepts, sections, and consequences of this significant legislative measure.

## Background

Before the enactment of the JOBS Act, startups and small businesses in the United States faced significant regulatory hurdles when attempting to raise capital. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) of 2002, for example, had imposed rigorous financial reporting requirements on public companies, which, while intended to protect investors from fraud, also made it expensive and complex for smaller companies to go public.

The global financial crisis of 2008 exacerbated these challenges as traditional funding sources like bank loans and venture capital dried up. Thus, there was a growing need for a legislative framework that could facilitate a more nurturing environment for emerging businesses. This is the context in which the JOBS Act was conceived and promoted.

## Key Provisions of the JOBS Act

The JOBS Act is divided into several titles, each dealing with specific aspects of facilitating capital formation for small businesses:

### Title I: Reopening American Capital Markets to Emerging Growth Companies

This title introduces the concept of an "Emerging Growth Company" (EGC), which is defined as a company with less than $1 billion in annual gross revenues during its most recently completed fiscal year. Title I aims to make it easier for EGCs to go public by:

1. **Reducing Disclosure Requirements**: EGCs are exempt from some of the more onerous disclosure requirements under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for a period of up to five years after going public.
2. **Confidential Filing**: Allows EGCs to submit confidential draft registration statements to the SEC for review before going public.
3. **Simplified Auditing**: EGCs are exempt from certain auditing requirements, including the need for an auditor to attest to the company’s internal control over financial reporting.
4. **Testing the Waters**: Permits EGCs to communicate with potential investors to gauge interest before officially filing for IPO.

### Title II: Access to Capital for Job Creators

Title II of the JOBS Act lifts the ban on general solicitation, allowing businesses to publicly advertise their investment opportunities. It does this through:

1. **Regulation D, Rule 506(c)**: Previously, Regulation D offerings were limited to private placements, which could only be marketed to accredited investors. Under Rule 506(c), issuers can now engage in general solicitation and advertising, provided that all purchasers are verified as accredited investors.

### Title III: Crowdfunding

Title III introduces the concept of crowdfunding as a method for raising capital. It allows small businesses to raise modest amounts of money from a large number of people via online platforms. Key points include:

1. **Investment Limits**: There are caps on the amount that individuals can invest in a 12-month period, which range depending on the investor's net worth or annual income.
2. **Disclosure Requirements**: Issuers must disclose certain information to the SEC, investors, and the intermediary facilitating the crowdfunding offering.
3. **Intermediaries**: Crowdfunding must be conducted through an SEC-registered intermediary, either a broker or a funding portal.

### Title IV: Small Company Capital Formation (Regulation A+)

Title IV updates Regulation A, an exemption from registration for public offerings. The updated rule, often referred to as Regulation A+, allows companies to offer and sell securities to the general public without having to meet the full SEC registration requirements. Regulation A+ outlines two tiers:

1. **Tier 1**: For offerings of up to $20 million in a 12-month period.
2. **Tier 2**: For offerings of up to $50 million in a 12-month period, with additional reporting requirements.

### Title V: Private Company Flexibility and Growth

Title V raises the threshold for mandatory SEC registration from 500 shareholders of record to 2,000 shareholders, or 500 non-accredited investors. This enables more private companies to grow and raise capital without the regulatory burdens of being a public company.

### Title VI: Capital Expansion

Title VI provides additional regulatory relief for smaller public companies, including allowing companies with less than $75 million in revenue to use streamlined SEC reporting requirements.

### Title VII: Outreach on Changes to the Law

Title VII mandates that the SEC provide education and outreach to inform businesses and their investors about the changes made by the JOBS Act.

## Impact and Reception

The reception of the JOBS Act has been mixed, with both praise and criticism from various stakeholders. Proponents argue that the act has significantly lowered the barriers to capital formation for small businesses, leading to increased entrepreneurial activity and job creation. Critics, however, express concerns over the potential for increased fraud and diminished investor protections due to reduced regulatory oversight.

### Success Stories

Several companies have successfully utilized the provisions of the JOBS Act to raise capital and scale their businesses:

1. **Elio Motors**: This startup raised nearly $17 million through Regulation A+ to develop its three-wheeled car.
2. **Goldbely**: The online food marketplace raised funds through equity crowdfunding, showcasing how startups can leverage new capital-raising avenues.

### Criticism and Concerns

While the JOBS Act has unlocked new financing mechanisms, it has also faced criticism. Some concerns include:

1. **Reduced Investor Protections**: Eased regulations could increase the risk of fraud and failure, potentially harming investors who may not have the resources to conduct thorough due diligence.
2. **Insufficient Oversight**: The flexibility provided to emerging growth companies in terms of disclosure and auditing may lead to less transparency and accountability.

## Future Prospects

Since its enactment, the JOBS Act has spurred discussions on how to balance the needs for investor protection with the necessity of fostering innovation and economic growth. Continuous adjustments and amendments may be necessary to address the evolving landscape of capital markets and technology-driven fundraising methods.

### Legislative Updates

Future legislative efforts could either expand on the current framework of the JOBS Act or introduce new measures aimed at addressing identified shortcomings. For example, there could be new rules to improve investor education, enhance fraud detection mechanisms, or streamline reporting requirements further.

In summary, the JOBS Act represents a significant shift in the regulatory landscape for small business funding in the United States. By understanding its main provisions, impact, and ongoing challenges, businesses and investors can better navigate the opportunities and risks presented by this legislation.

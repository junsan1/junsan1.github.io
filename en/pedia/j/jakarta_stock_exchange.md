# Jakarta Stock Exchange

The Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX), now known as the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) after its merger with the Surabaya Stock Exchange in 2007, represents a flourishing hub in the world of investment and trading. Situated in Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia, IDX is a pivotal institution in the Southeast Asian financial landscape. The Jakarta Stock Exchange, before its merger, played a crucial role in the development of Indonesia's financial systems and market regulations. This comprehensive analysis unfolds the historical evolution, structural framework, trading mechanisms, market indices, and overall role of the Jakarta Stock Exchange in the algotrading context.

## Historical Evolution

The Jakarta Stock Exchange traces its roots back to December 1912, when it was established by the Dutch during the colonial period. Initially, its primary operations were modest, focusing on trading stocks and bonds from Dutch companies operating in the Dutch East Indies. However, activities were halted during World War II and did not resume until 1977, driven by the Indonesian government's initiatives under President Suharto.

### Revival and Growth

Under the supervision of the Capital Market Supervisory Agency (Badan Pengawas Pasar Modal, Bapepam), the JSX was relaunched with the aim of developing the Indonesian capital market. The revival phase saw significant steps such as:

- **Introduction of Automated Trading System (ATS):** In 1995, to enhance trading efficiency and transparency, JSX transitioned from manual trading methods to the Automated Trading System, marking a revolutionary technological shift. This system supported algorithmic trading strategies, enhancing liquidity and market depth.
- **Financial Reforms and Deregulation:** The Indonesian government introduced several reforms aimed at deregulating the financial markets, encouraging foreign investment, and enhancing corporate governance standards.

### Merger and Formation of IDX

On December 1, 2007, the Jakarta Stock Exchange merged with the Surabaya Stock Exchange to form the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX). This merger aimed to unify the trading platforms and streamline operations, thus creating a more robust and competitive marketplace. The IDX continues to inherit the legacy and operations of the JSX, including its automated systems conducive to algotrading.

## Structural Framework

The structure of the Jakarta Stock Exchange, now IDX, is designed to foster a conducive environment for traders, investors, and listed companies alike. Key components of its structural framework include:

### Governing Bodies

- **Bursa Efek Indonesia (BEI):** The BEI or IDX functions as the operational body managing listing requirements, market operations, and member regulations.

### Market Segments

IDX operates several segments catering to varied investment preferences:

- **Main Board:** Hosts established corporations with substantial business operations, adhering to stringent regulatory standards.

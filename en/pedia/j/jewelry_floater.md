# Jewelry Floater

## Definition
A **Jewelry Floater** is an [insurance](../i/insurance.md) policy [rider](../r/rider.md) or [endorsement](../e/endorsement.md) that provides coverage specifically for jewelry items beyond the standard limits of a typical homeowner's [insurance](../i/insurance.md) policy. This type of coverage is designed to protect high-[value](../v/value.md) jewelry against risks such as theft, loss, damage, or mysterious disappearance.

## Key Components
1. **Coverage Amount**: The jewelry floater provides a specific amount of coverage for each insured item, often based on appraised [value](../v/value.md).

3. **Deductible**: May or may not have a deductible, depending on the terms of the policy.
4. **[Appraisal](../a/appraisal.md) Requirement**: Insurers typically require an [appraisal](../a/appraisal.md) or detailed description of the jewelry to establish its [value](../v/value.md).

## Importance
1. **Protection for High-[Value](../v/value.md) Items**: Standard homeowner's [insurance](../i/insurance.md) policies have limits on coverage for valuable items like jewelry, which may not be sufficient for high-[value](../v/value.md) pieces.
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Provides broader coverage than standard policies, often including accidental loss or mysterious disappearance.
3. **Peace of Mind**: Offers [assurance](../a/assurance.md) that valuable jewelry is protected against a wide [range](../r/range.md) of risks.

## Example Scenarios
1. **Engagement Ring**: A newly engaged couple adds a jewelry floater to their homeowner's [insurance](../i/insurance.md) to ensure the engagement ring is covered for its full appraised [value](../v/value.md).
2. **Heirloom Necklace**: An individual inherits a valuable necklace and purchases a jewelry floater to protect it against theft and damage.
3. **Frequent Travelers**: A person who frequently travels internationally insures their collection of expensive watches with a jewelry floater to protect against loss or theft while traveling.

## Process of Obtaining a Jewelry Floater
1. **[Appraisal](../a/appraisal.md)**: Obtain an [appraisal](../a/appraisal.md) from a certified jeweler to determine the current [value](../v/value.md) of the jewelry.
2. **[Insurance](../i/insurance.md) [Quote](../q/quote.md)**: Contact an [insurance](../i/insurance.md) provider to get a [quote](../q/quote.md) for the jewelry floater based on the appraised [value](../v/value.md).
3. **Policy Purchase**: Purchase the jewelry floater and provide the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) company with the [appraisal](../a/appraisal.md) and any necessary documentation.
4. **Policy Maintenance**: Keep the policy updated, including periodic reappraisals to ensure coverage amounts reflect current values.

## Challenges
1. **Cost**: Jewelry floaters can be expensive, especially for high-[value](../v/value.md) items.
2. **[Appraisal](../a/appraisal.md) Accuracy**: Ensuring accurate and up-to-date appraisals to avoid underinsuring or overinsuring items.
3. **Claims Process**: The claims process can be detailed and require substantial documentation and proof of loss.

2. **Detailed Documentation**: Keep detailed records, including photos and appraisals, of all insured jewelry items.
3. **Review Policy Terms**: Understand the terms and conditions of the jewelry floater, including any exclusions or limitations.

# Joint Entropy

### Introduction to Entropy in Trading

In the field of information theory, entropy is a measure of the [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) or randomness in a system. When applied to trading, entropy can help quantify the unpredictability of price movements or the degree of disorder in a [market](../m/market.md). Traditional entropy in trading often deals with the analysis of individual securities or the [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of returns on an investment. However, when dealing with [multiple](../m/multiple.md) variables, such as the relationship between different assets, we need to consider [joint](../j/joint.md) entropy.

### What is Joint Entropy?

[Joint](../j/joint.md) entropy extends the concept of entropy to a pair or set of [random variables](../r/random_variables.md). It quantifies the overall [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) within a system involving [multiple](../m/multiple.md) interacting variables. Mathematically, if we have two discrete [random variables](../r/random_variables.md), X and Y, the [joint](../j/joint.md) entropy H(X, Y) is defined as:

\[ H(X, Y) = - \sum_x \sum_y P(x, y) \log P(x, y) \]

where \( P(x, y) \) is the [joint](../j/joint.md) [probability distribution](../p/probability_distribution.md) of X and Y.

In the context of trading, X and Y could represent the returns of two different financial assets, such as [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, or currencies. [Joint](../j/joint.md) entropy considers the combined [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) of these assets' returns and can provide insights into their interdependencies.

### Relevance of Joint Entropy in Trading

#### Portfolio Diversification

One of the primary applications of [joint](../j/joint.md) entropy in trading is in [portfolio diversification](../p/portfolio_diversification.md). By assessing the [joint](../j/joint.md) entropy between different assets, traders and portfolio managers can better understand the level of [diversification](../d/diversification.md) within their portfolios. A portfolio with low [joint](../j/joint.md) entropy indicates that the assets are highly correlated, which could lead to higher [risk](../r/risk.md) since the assets may move together during [market](../m/market.md) events. Conversely, a portfolio with high [joint](../j/joint.md) entropy suggests a more diversified set of assets with lower overall [risk](../r/risk.md).

#### Risk Management

[Joint](../j/joint.md) entropy can also be used for [risk management](../r/risk_management.md). By evaluating the [joint](../j/joint.md) entropy of returns between various financial instruments, traders can identify potential risks associated with [asset](../a/asset.md) interdependencies. For instance, during periods of [market](../m/market.md) stress, seemingly [uncorrelated assets](../u/uncorrelated_assets.md) might exhibit increased [correlation](../c/correlation.md), thereby reducing the effectiveness of [diversification](../d/diversification.md). Understanding these [joint](../j/joint.md) entropies allows for the proactive management of such risks.

#### Algorithmic Trading Strategies

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) strategies, such as [pairs trading](../p/pairs_trading.md) or statistical [arbitrage](../a/arbitrage.md), can benefit from the use of [joint](../j/joint.md) entropy. In [pairs trading](../p/pairs_trading.md), the strategy involves trading two assets with the assumption that their price movements [will](../w/will.md) converge or move together over time. By calculating the [joint](../j/joint.md) entropy of these [asset](../a/asset.md) pairs, traders can better select pairs with stronger interdependent movements, potentially increasing the strategy's profitability.

### Calculating Joint Entropy in Trading

#### Data Collection

The first step in calculating [joint](../j/joint.md) entropy is to gather historical price data for the assets in question. This data can be obtained from various financial data providers such as [Bloomberg](../b/bloomberg.md), [Reuters](../r/reuters.md), or [Yahoo Finance](../y/yahoo_finance.md). The data should be in the form of [time series](../t/time_series.md) representing the prices or returns of the assets over a specific period.

#### Probability Distribution Estimation

The next step is to estimate the [joint](../j/joint.md) [probability distribution](../p/probability_distribution.md) of the [asset](../a/asset.md) returns. This can be achieved using various methods, such as:

- **[Histogram](../h/histogram.md) Estimation**: This involves partitioning the [range](../r/range.md) of possible returns into discrete bins and counting the occurrences within each bin to estimate the [joint probability](../j/joint_probability.md).
  
- **Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)**: This non-parametric method uses kernels to smooth the [joint](../j/joint.md) [probability distribution](../p/probability_distribution.md), providing a more continuous estimate.

#### Joint Entropy Calculation

Once the [joint](../j/joint.md) [probability distribution](../p/probability_distribution.md) is estimated, the [joint](../j/joint.md) entropy can be calculated using the formula mentioned earlier. This calculation typically involves iterating over all possible pairs of returns, computing the probabilities, and summing the resulting values.

### Example of Joint Entropy Application

#### Portfolio Diversification Example

Consider a portfolio containing two assets, A and B. The [historical returns](../h/historical_returns.md) for these assets over a period of 10 days are as follows:

| Day | [Return](../r/return.md) A | [Return](../r/return.md) B |
|-----|----------|----------|
| 1   | 0.01     | 0.02     |
| 2   | -0.02    | -0.01    |
| 3   | 0.03     | 0.04     |
| 4   | 0.01     | -0.02    |
| 5   | 0.00     | 0.01     |
| 6   | -0.03    | -0.03    |
| 7   | 0.02     | 0.03     |
| 8   | -0.01    | -0.02    |
| 9   | 0.01     | 0.02     |
| 10  | 0.03     | 0.03     |

Using these returns, we can estimate the [joint](../j/joint.md) [probability distribution](../p/probability_distribution.md) and subsequently calculate the [joint](../j/joint.md) entropy. Let us assume we opt for [histogram](../h/histogram.md) estimation and divide the returns into discrete bins. After estimating the probabilities, we can compute the [joint](../j/joint.md) entropy.

The computed [joint](../j/joint.md) entropy provides insights into the relationship between the returns of assets A and B. A high [joint](../j/joint.md) entropy would indicate that the assets' returns are not closely related, suggesting good [diversification](../d/diversification.md) within the portfolio. On the other hand, a low [joint](../j/joint.md) entropy would imply that the returns are interdependent, indicating a need for reevaluation of the portfolio composition.

### Tools and Libraries for Calculating Joint Entropy

Several programming languages and libraries can facilitate the calculation of [joint](../j/joint.md) entropy in trading:

- **Python**: Python offers a [range](../r/range.md) of libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and Pandas for numerical computations, as well as specific libraries like `sklearn` for probability estimation and entropy calculation.

- **R**: The `entropy` package in R provides functions for entropy calculation, including [joint](../j/joint.md) entropy.

- **Matlab**: Matlab's statistical toolbox includes functions for [probability distribution](../p/probability_distribution.md) estimation and entropy computation.

- **MATLAB**: Includes functions and toolboxes for numerical analysis and [probability distribution](../p/probability_distribution.md) estimation.

### Conclusion

[Joint](../j/joint.md) entropy is a powerful metric in trading, providing crucial insights into the interdependencies between different financial assets. It aids in [portfolio diversification](../p/portfolio_diversification.md), [risk management](../r/risk_management.md), and the development of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) strategies. By understanding and applying [joint](../j/joint.md) entropy, traders and portfolio managers can make more informed decisions, ultimately leading to better-performing and more [robust](../r/robust.md) [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

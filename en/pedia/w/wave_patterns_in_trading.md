# Wave Patterns

Wave patterns in trading are significant [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) tools traders use to understand [market](../m/market.md) movements and make predictions. Primarily guided by the principles of the [Elliott Wave Theory](../e/elliott_wave_theory.md), wave patterns are visual representations delineating the cyclical nature of price movements in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). In this article, we'll delve into the basics of wave patterns, their psychological foundations, types, practical applications, and the influence they wield in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md).

### 1. Introduction to Wave Theory

Developed by Ralph Nelson Elliott in the 1930s, the [Elliott Wave Theory](../e/elliott_wave_theory.md) proposes that [market](../m/market.md) prices unfold in specific patterns, often reflective of crowd behavior. Elliott posited that financial [market](../m/market.md) prices move in predictable waves, making it possible to predict future movements based on historical price data.

### 2. Core Concepts of Elliott Wave Theory

At the heart of the [Elliott Wave Theory](../e/elliott_wave_theory.md) are two basic patterns: Impulse waves and Corrective waves.

#### 2.1 Impulse Waves

Impulse waves consist of five sub-waves that move in the direction of the larger [trend](../t/trend.md). They are labeled as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

- **Wave 1**: This wave is the initial move upwards. Often accompanied by a sparsely populated consensus that the [market](../m/market.md) is moving in the right direction.

- **Wave 2**: This wave corrects the initial move and [will](../w/will.md) often see prices drop. However, prices do not drop to the starting point of Wave 1. This wave is characterized by significant skepticism about the upward move.

- **Wave 3**: Typically the longest and strongest wave, Wave 3 moves prices far and quickly in the direction of the [trend](../t/trend.md). It is often marked by increased [volume](../v/volume.md) and broader acceptance of the [trend](../t/trend.md) by [market](../m/market.md) participants.

- **Wave 4**: This wave is a [correction](../c/correction.md) of the Wave 3 move. It is usually more complex and versatile in form, and [volume](../v/volume.md) typically decreases.

- **Wave 5**: This wave represents the final move in the direction of the primary [trend](../t/trend.md). It often lacks the [momentum](../m/momentum.md) seen in Wave 3 and may result in fewer participants getting involved.

#### 2.2 Corrective Waves

Corrective waves consist of three sub-waves labeled as A, B, and C.

- **Wave A**: Often counter-[trend](../t/trend.md), Wave A appears after the five-wave impulse sequence and represents the initial [pullback](../p/pullback.md).

- **Wave B**: This wave is typically a move in the direction of the original [trend](../t/trend.md). This wave is often mistaken for the continuation of the original [trend](../t/trend.md) but lacks [momentum](../m/momentum.md).

- **Wave C**: Wave C is the final wave in the [correction](../c/correction.md) sequence, pushing prices against the primary [trend](../t/trend.md) significantly.

### 3. Sub-Wave Structures and Degrees

Each wave, whether impulse or corrective, forms smaller wave patterns within themselves, known as sub-waves. Elliott identified nine degrees of waves, providing an extensive hierarchy that enables traders to analyze [market](../m/market.md) movements on different time scales, ranging from long-term [secular](../s/secular.md) trends to short-term minute-by-minute changes.

### 4. Wave Guidelines

The [Elliott Wave Theory](../e/elliott_wave_theory.md) isn't devoid of rules. Adherence to specific guidelines ensures the integrity of wave counts:

- **Wave 2 cannot retrace more than 100% of Wave 1.**
- **Wave 3 is not the shortest among waves 1, 3, and 5.**
- **Wave 4 does not overlap Wave 1 in price territory, except in special cases (e.g., diagonal triangles).**

Correct application of these rules ensures the accuracy of wave interpretation, forming the backbone of reliable [market](../m/market.md) predictions.

### 5. Fibonacci Relationships

A critical aspect that complements [Elliott Wave Theory](../e/elliott_wave_theory.md) is Fibonacci retracements and extensions. The natural Fibonacci sequence, identified by mathematicians, relates closely to the natural patterns found in wave movements, providing predictable [retracement](../r/retracement.md) and extension levels. Common Fibonacci ratios include 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 100%.

### 6. Practical Applications in Trading

Wave patterns provide traders with insight into potential [trend](../t/trend.md) reversals and [continuation patterns](../c/continuation_patterns.md). Identifying the completion of wave cycles helps traders get positioned favorably:

- **Entry Points**: Identifying the beginning of Wave 3 or Wave C provides [lucrative](../l/lucrative.md) entry points as these waves are characteristically large and swift in movement.

- **Exit Points**: Recognizing Wave 5 or Wave B as terminal waves aids traders in locking maximum [profit](../p/profit.md) before corrective moves take place.

### 7. Wave Patterns in Algorithmic Trading

[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) leverages the computational powers of algorithms to identify and [capitalize](../c/capitalize.md) on wave patterns. By integrating [wave theory](../w/wave_theory.md) principles into algorithmic models, traders can execute trades with high precision:

- **[Backtesting](../b/backtesting.md) Algorithms**: Algorithms can backtest large historical data sets to validate the presence of wave patterns and optimize entry/exit strategies accordingly.

- **[Pattern Recognition](../p/pattern_recognition.md) Software**: Modern AI-powered software can identify wave patterns in real-time, notifying traders about potential trading opportunities as they unfold.

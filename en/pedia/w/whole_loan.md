# Whole Loan

In the realms of [finance](../f/finance.md) and trading, particularly within [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) and [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) markets, the term "Whole [Loan](../l/loan.md)" refers to a type of financial product that is sold in its entirety by the originator, usually a [lender](../l/lender.md) like a [bank](../b/bank.md) or a financial institution, to an [investor](../i/investor.md) or another [lender](../l/lender.md). Unlike securities, whole loans are not pooled together and sliced into various [tranches](../t/tranches.md); rather, they remain as individual, distinct loans. 

## Key Characteristics

### 1. **Individual Loan Unit**
A whole [loan](../l/loan.md) is a single [loan](../l/loan.md), distinct from [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)-backed securities (MBS), which are aggregations of many individual loans. Each whole [loan](../l/loan.md) retains its unique characteristics, such as its [duration](../d/duration.md), [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md), and borrower-related specifics.

### 2. **Transaction Participants**
The [transaction](../t/transaction.md) typically involves a seller (often a [bank](../b/bank.md) or direct [lender](../l/lender.md)) and a buyer (typically institutional investors like [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies, investment funds, or other financial institutions). The originator of the [loan](../l/loan.md) may decide to sell it off their books to free up [capital](../c/capital.md) or minimize [risk](../r/risk.md) exposure.

### 3. **Risk Management**
Investors purchasing whole loans assume all associated risks, including borrower [default risk](../d/default_risk.md), [interest rate risk](../i/interest_rate_risk.md), and [prepayment risk](../p/prepayment_risk.md). This can be high-[risk](../r/risk.md) but often provides higher yields compared to other fixed-[income](../i/income.md) investments.

### 4. **Customization**
Whole loans can be tailored to the specific [risk](../r/risk.md)/reward profiles that buyers are seeking. This level of customization is often not available in packaged securities that homogenize the [risk factors](../r/risk_factors_in_trading.md) through pooling.

### 5. **Due Diligence & Pricing**
When purchasing a whole [loan](../l/loan.md), extensive [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md) is required. The pricing of whole loans factors in the [credit](../c/credit.md) quality of the borrower, the [loan](../l/loan.md)-to-[value](../v/value.md) ratio (LTV), the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) environment, and other elements that assess the [risk](../r/risk.md) and potential [yield](../y/yield.md) of the individual [loan](../l/loan.md).

## Use Cases in Finance

### Whole Loan Trading
Whole [loan](../l/loan.md) trading refers to the buying and selling of these individual loans between financial institutions and investors. This [trade](../t/trade.md) allows lenders to manage their balance sheets more fluidly, offloading [risk](../r/risk.md) to parties willing to take it on.

### Whole Loans vs. Securitized Loans
Whole loans provide a more [direct investment](../d/direct_investment.md) compared to securitized loans, which are often part of larger structured products. Instead of taking a fractional [interest](../i/interest.md) in a pool, an [investor](../i/investor.md) in a whole [loan](../l/loan.md) own the entire [note](../n/note.md), thus gaining more control but also more exposure to [risk](../r/risk.md).

## Market Participants

### 1. **Banks & Financial Institutions**
Banks originating the loans often sell these assets to manage [capital](../c/capital.md) more efficiently and to comply with regulatory requirements. 

### 2. **Investment Firms & Hedge Funds**
These entities purchase whole loans to diversify their portfolios and seek higher returns. They conduct in-depth [risk](../r/risk.md) assessments to determine the viability of these investments.

### 3. **Insurance Companies**
Due to the long-term nature of their liabilities, [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies are exemplary purchasers of whole loans, especially for the fixed and predictable [income](../i/income.md) streams these loans generate.

### 4. **Secondary Market Participants**
Entities specializing in [secondary market](../s/secondary_market.md) trading of whole loans often act as intermediaries, facilitating the buying and selling process between the original [lender](../l/lender.md) and the end-[investor](../i/investor.md).

## Benefits of Whole Loans

### 1. **Higher Yields**
Investors in whole loans often achieve higher yields compared to other fixed-[income](../i/income.md) products due to the specific risks they undertake.

### 2. **Diversification**
Whole loans provide a way to diversify investment portfolios through exposure to various geographic locations, borrower profiles, and [loan](../l/loan.md) types.

### 3. **Customization**
Loans can be tailored to meet the specific needs of investors, aligning investment strategies with [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) and [return](../r/return.md) expectations.

### 4. **Control Over Terms**
Investors maintain more control over the terms, management, and servicing of the [loan](../l/loan.md), rather than sharing decision-making with other pool investors.

## Risks of Whole Loans

### 1. **Credit Risk**
There is always the [risk](../r/risk.md) that the borrower may [default](../d/default.md) on the [loan](../l/loan.md), risking the loss of [invested capital](../i/invested_capital.md).

### 2. **Interest Rate Risk**
Fluctuations in [interest](../i/interest.md) rates can affect the [value](../v/value.md) of fixed-[income](../i/income.md) assets, including whole loans.

### 3. **Prepayment Risk**
Borrowers may choose to pay off their loans early, reducing the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) on the investment as the owner of the whole [loan](../l/loan.md) may have to reinvest funds in a potentially lower [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) environment.

### 4. **Liquidity Risk**
Whole loans are generally less [liquid](../l/liquid.md) than other securities, making it harder to sell them quickly without possibly taking a [discount](../d/discount.md) on the [sale](../s/sale.md) price.

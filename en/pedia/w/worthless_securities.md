# Worthless Securities

## Definition and Introduction 

Worthless securities are financial instruments that have little to no [market value](../m/market_value.md) and are often deemed unacceptable as [collateral](../c/collateral.md). These securities may include [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, or other forms of investment that have become devalued due to various reasons. When a [security](../s/security.md) becomes worthless, it not only presents a significant loss to the holder but also reflects the failing performance of the issuing entity. 

## Common Types of Worthless Securities

1. **[Penny Stocks](../p/penny_stocks.md)**: These are low-priced [shares](../s/shares.md) of small companies, often [listed](../l/listed.md) on less regulated exchanges like the OTC (Over-the-Counter) markets. The lack of [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md), low company [valuation](../v/valuation.md), and minimal regulatory oversight make [penny stocks](../p/penny_stocks.md) highly susceptible to becoming worthless.

2. **Distressed Bonds**: Bonds issued by companies that are undergoing [financial distress](../f/financial_distress.md) can almost become worthless if the issuing company goes bankrupt or defaults on the [debt](../d/debt.md).

3. **Failed Startups Stock**: Equities of failed startups that could not generate [revenue](../r/revenue.md) or secure further investments. As the [startup](../s/startup.md) folds, its [stocks](../s/stock.md) in the hands of the shareholders become worthless.

4. **[Out-of-the-Money Options](../o/out-of-the-money_options.md)**: [Options](../o/options.md) contracts that have an [exercise price](../e/excersise_price.md) significantly above (for call [options](../o/options.md)) or below (for [put options](../p/put_options.md)) the current [market price](../m/market_price.md) of the [underlying asset](../u/underlying_asset.md), and are not likely to reach that price before expiration.

## Causes of Worthlessness 

1. **[Bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md)**: One of the most common reasons for a [security](../s/security.md) to become worthless is the [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) of the issuing company. When a company declares [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md), its assets are liquidated to pay off debts, and shareholders are often left with nothing.

2. **[Fraud](../f/fraud.md) and Scandals**: Corporate frauds or scandals can dramatically devalue a company’s securities, sometimes rendering them completely worthless. An example is the Enron scandal, which led to the company’s stock becoming essentially worthless.

3. **Economic Downturns**: Recessions or economic depressions can cause a sharp decrease in [market](../m/market.md) values across various sectors, leading many previously sound investments to become worthless.

4. **Technological Obsolescence**: Companies operating in fast-evolving technological sectors may have their valuations plummet if they [fail](../f/fail.md) to keep up with advancements, rendering their [stocks](../s/stock.md) worthless.

## Legal and Tax Implications

### US Tax Code

Under the U.S. Internal [Revenue](../r/revenue.md) Code Section 165(g)(1), taxpayers may claim a [deduction](../d/deduction.md) for a loss on worthless securities. The specifics of claiming this [deduction](../d/deduction.md) require the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) to demonstrate that the securities have become completely worthless within the tax year in question. A [security](../s/security.md) is considered worthless in this context if it has no current [market value](../m/market_value.md) and no potential for future [value](../v/value.md).

### Loss Deduction

Investors can declare worthless securities as a [capital](../c/capital.md) loss, offsetting gains from other investments, effectively reducing the [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md). However, it's crucial that the [taxpayer](../t/taxpayer.md) provides substantial evidence for the [security](../s/security.md)’s worthlessness, such as [insolvency](../i/insolvency.md) reports or [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md) notices from the company.

## Real-World Examples

1. **Enron (2001)**: Enron's collapse in 2001 serves as a classic example of how a combination of [fraud](../f/fraud.md) and poor management can render a company's securities worthless almost overnight.

2. **[Lehman Brothers](../l/lehman_brothers.md) (2008)**: During the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md), [Lehman Brothers](../l/lehman_brothers.md) filed for [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md), sending its stock plummeting from over $60 per share to mere cents.

3. **[Bear Stearns](../b/bear_stearns.md) (2008)**: Another financial giant whose stock became nearly worthless in the wake of the 2008 [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md), eventually being sold to JPMorgan Chase for a pittance compared to its former [value](../v/value.md). 

## How to Avoid Investing in Worthless Securities

1. **Thorough [Due Diligence](../d/due_diligence.md)**: Before making any investment, conduct in-depth research on the company, including its [financial statements](../f/financial_statements.md), [industry](../i/industry.md) standing, and future growth prospects.

2. **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: Spreading investments across various [asset](../a/asset.md) classes and sectors can mitigate the [risk](../r/risk.md) of any single [security](../s/security.md) becoming worthless.

3. **Attention to [Market](../m/market.md) Signals**: Be attentive to [market](../m/market.md) trends and signals, including [insider trading](../i/insider.md) activities, analyst downgrades, or any news indicative of a company's downturn.

4. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md) Tools**: Utilize [stop-loss orders](../s/stop-loss_orders.md) and [options](../o/options.md) to [hedge](../h/hedge.md) investments against severe downturns.

5. **Regulatory Filings**: Regularly review SEC filings and other mandatory disclosures for signs of [financial distress](../f/financial_distress.md), such as delayed filings or adverse auditor opinions.

## Recovery Options and Strategies

In the unfortunate event of holding worthless securities, investors can pursue the following recovery strategies:

1. **[Tax Loss Harvesting](../t/tax_loss_harvesting.md)**: Claiming the loss on worthless securities can be a beneficial strategy to reduct [taxable income](../t/taxable_income.md), as previously discussed.

2. **Settlement Claims**: In certain scenarios, like corporate [fraud](../f/fraud.md), class-action lawsuits may provide an avenue to recover a portion of the investment through legal settlements.

3. **Trading on [Bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) Markets**: Sometimes, bankrupt companies' [stocks](../s/stock.md) continue to [trade](../t/trade.md) on OTC markets. While extremely risky, there can be potential for recovery if the company reorganizes successfully.

4. **[Sale](../s/sale.md) to Loss Buyers**: Some entities specialize in buying completely devalued securities for a small [fee](../f/fee.md). This can at least afford investors an official closure of the position and potential tax benefits.

## Conclusion

Worthless securities are an unfortunate reality of [investing](../i/investing.md), but being informed about their causes, tax implications, and recovery [options](../o/options.md) can arm investors with the knowledge to navigate and mitigate such risks. Through diligent research, strategic [diversification](../d/diversification.md), and appropriate loss management, the adverse impact of worthless securities can be significantly reduced. Understanding these principles is particularly critical for those involved in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) and fintech, where the rapid [execution](../e/execution.md) and high frequency of trades require [robust](../r/robust.md) [risk management systems](../r/risk_management_systems.md).

# Weekend Effect

The Weekend Effect, also known as the Monday Effect, is a phenomenon observed in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) where stock returns on Mondays are often lower than those of the preceding Friday. It's considered an [anomaly](../a/anomaly.md) because, according to the [efficient market hypothesis](../e/efficient_market_hypothesis.md), stock prices should not show predictable patterns based on calendar days or other non-economic factors. The Weekend Effect is a subject of considerable [interest](../i/interest.md) and debate among traders, investors, and academics alike.

## Historical Context

The [anomaly](../a/anomaly.md) was first noted in the 1970s, when researchers observed that average returns on stock markets were significantly lower on Mondays compared to other days of the week. For instance, in a paper published in 1973, Kenneth French noted that returns on the New York Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (NYSE) were, on average, negative on Mondays. This contrasted sharply with the positive average returns on Fridays. Subsequent studies have consistently confirmed the existence of the Weekend Effect, not just in the U.S., but in various international markets as well.

## Possible Causes

Several theories have been proposed to explain the Weekend Effect:

### Investor Psychology

One of the most cited reasons is related to [investor](../i/investor.md) psychology. According to this theory, negative news is more likely to be released during the weekend. Due to a lack of trading on Saturday and Sunday, this information isn't immediately factored into stock prices. As a result, investors adjust their positions on Monday morning, often leading to a decline in stock prices.

### Institutional Practices

Another explanation involves institutional behavior. Large institutional investors, such as mutual funds and pension funds, may engage in [portfolio rebalancing](../p/portfolio_rebalancing.md) or [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md) activities on Fridays. This increases the [demand](../d/demand.md) for [stocks](../s/stock.md) at the end of the week, thereby driving prices higher. On Monday, the buying pressure subsides, resulting in lower prices.

### Short Selling

A different angle focuses on [short selling](../s/short_selling.md). Some research suggests that short sellers are more active on Fridays, expecting reduced trading activities over the weekend to help magnify their gains. As they close their positions by Monday morning, buying pressure is diminished, contributing further to the observed decline.

### Settlement Systems

In many markets, financial transactions are settled a few days after the [trade](../t/trade.md) date (T+2 or T+3). The weekend could disrupt this cycle, causing a temporary imbalance that may affect stock prices. For example, dividends declared over the weekend but not yet factored into stock prices could lead to Monday morning adjustments.

## Empirical Evidence

Several empirical studies have provided a [wealth](../w/wealth.md) of data supporting the existence of the Weekend Effect. One notable study by French (1980) found that from 1953-1977, the [average return](../a/average_return.md) on the S&P 500 [index](../i/index_instrument.md) was significantly negative on Mondays.

A more recent study by Lucey and Cuthbertson (2017) looked at 47 international markets over the period from 1992-2013. They found that while the magnitude of the Weekend Effect has diminished over time, it still persists in many countries, particularly in emerging markets.

## Contradictory Findings

Despite overwhelming evidence supporting the Weekend Effect, some studies have found contradictory results. For instance, a study by Barone (1990) indicated that the Weekend Effect had disappeared in the Italian [stock market](../s/stock_market.md) by the late 1980s. Similar findings have been noted in other developed markets, suggesting that increased [market efficiency](../m/market_efficiency.md) may be eroding the [anomaly](../a/anomaly.md) over time.

## Implications for Traders and Investors

### Trading Strategies

Understanding the Weekend Effect can inform [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). For example, some traders may choose to sell [stocks](../s/stock.md) on Fridays to avoid potential losses on Mondays. Conversely, others might see Monday's traditionally lower prices as a buying opportunity.

### Risk Management

Being aware of the Weekend Effect is also crucial for effective [risk management](../r/risk_management.md). Investors holding positions over the weekend might want to consider the increased [volatility](../v/volatility.md) and potential for negative returns on Monday.

### Algorithmic Trading

For those engaged in [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md), incorporating the Weekend Effect can improve model accuracy. [Predictive models](../p/predictive_models_in_trading.md) and algorithms can be tweaked to account for the [anomaly](../a/anomaly.md), potentially enhancing returns.

### Behavioral Finance

The Weekend Effect offers valuable insights for the field of [behavioral finance](../b/behavioral_finance.md). It challenges the [efficient market hypothesis](../e/efficient_market_hypothesis.md) and suggests that psychological factors play a significant role in [market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md).

## Conclusion

The Weekend Effect remains one of the more intriguing anomalies in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). While its magnitude may have diminished in some markets over time, it still provides a compelling case for the role of psychology, [market microstructure](../m/market_microstructure.md), and institutional behavior in shaping stock prices. Traders, investors, and academics continue to study this phenomenon, seeking to understand its [underlying](../u/underlying.md) causes and exploiting its potential benefits.

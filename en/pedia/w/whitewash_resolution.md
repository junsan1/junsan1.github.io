# Whitewash Resolution

A **Whitewash Resolution** is a specific type of [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) approval that is required in certain jurisdictions for a company to proceed with a [transaction](../t/transaction.md) that would otherwise trigger mandatory [offer](../o/offer.md) requirements under [takeover](../t/takeover.md) regulations. The concept is most commonly associated with [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md) and the regulatory framework surrounding mergers and acquisitions (M&A). This article explores the intricacies of Whitewash Resolutions, delving into their purpose, procedural requirements, key stakeholders, and illustrative case studies.

## Introduction

A Whitewash Resolution is typically invoked in situations where a company is looking to [issue](../i/issue.md) new [shares](../s/shares.md) or acquire [shares](../s/shares.md) without triggering a mandatory [takeover](../t/takeover.md) [offer](../o/offer.md). This is commonly seen in cases of rights issues, [debt](../d/debt.md)-to-[equity](../e/equity.md) swaps, or share purchase agreements. The resolution serves to absolve the entity from making a mandatory general [offer](../o/offer.md) to all shareholders, provided the majority of independent shareholders approve the [transaction](../t/transaction.md).

## Regulatory Background

The regulatory requirements for Whitewash Resolutions can vary by jurisdiction. Here are examples of frameworks from different regions:

- **United Kingdom:** The UK [Takeover](../t/takeover.md) Code governs the requirement for Whitewash Resolutions. Rule 9 of the Code stipulates that any individual or group acquiring 30% or more of the voting rights in a company must make a mandatory [offer](../o/offer.md) to all shareholders. However, a Whitewash Resolution can exempt the acquirer from this obligation if approved by the independent shareholders.

- **Hong Kong:** The Hong Kong Code on Takeovers and Mergers has similar provisions. Rule 26 mandates a general [offer](../o/offer.md) when a person's shareholding breaches specific thresholds. A Whitewash Waiver can be granted if independent shareholders pass a resolution to this effect.

## Purpose and Importance

Whitewash Resolutions serve several critical purposes:

1. **Facilitating [Capital](../c/capital.md) Raising:** They allow companies to raise [capital](../c/capital.md) efficiently without triggering onerous and costly mandatory offers.
2. **[Debt Restructuring](../d/debt_restructuring.md):** Enable companies to convert [debt](../d/debt.md) into [equity](../e/equity.md), often essential in financial [restructuring](../r/restructuring.md).
3. **Corporate Flexibility:** Affords companies more flexibility in managing their share [capital](../c/capital.md) and corporate structure.

## Procedural Requirements

The process of obtaining a Whitewash Resolution typically involves the following steps:

1. **Circular to Shareholders:** The company must [issue](../i/issue.md) a detailed circular to shareholders explaining the [transaction](../t/transaction.md), its implications, and the Whitewash Resolution's purpose.
2. **Independent [Financial Advisor](../f/financial_advisor.md) (IFA):** An IFA must be appointed to provide an opinion on whether the [transaction](../t/transaction.md) and the Whitewash Resolution are fair and reasonable.
3. **General Meeting:** A general meeting of shareholders is convened to vote on the resolution. Only independent shareholders, i.e., those not involved in the [transaction](../t/transaction.md), are entitled to vote.
4. **Regulatory Approval:** In some jurisdictions, regulatory approval may also be necessary following the [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) vote.

## Key Stakeholders

Several key stakeholders are involved in the process of a Whitewash Resolution:

1. **Board of Directors:** Responsible for initiating the process and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.
2. **Independent Shareholders:** Their approval is crucial for the resolution to pass.
3. **Independent [Financial Advisor](../f/financial_advisor.md):** Provides an impartial assessment of the [transaction](../t/transaction.md).
4. **Regulatory Bodies:** Oversee the process to ensure fairness and compliance with applicable laws.

## Benefits

- **Cost [Efficiency](../e/efficiency.md):** Avoids the significant costs associated with making a general [offer](../o/offer.md) to all shareholders.
- **Speed:** Facilitates quicker [execution](../e/execution.md) of transactions.
- **[Shareholder Value](../s/shareholder_value.md):** Can enhance [shareholder value](../s/shareholder_value.md) by enabling more strategic [capital allocation](../c/capital_allocation.md) and [restructuring](../r/restructuring.md).

## Risks and Challenges

- **[Shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) Opposition:** Independent shareholders may not always approve the resolution.
- **Regulatory Scrutiny:** Extensive regulatory scrutiny can complicate the process.
- **[Conflict of Interest](../c/conflict_of_interest.md):** Potential conflicts must be managed transparently.

## Case Studies

1. **Clarke v Dunraven:** A significant case in the UK where the court ruled on the necessity of Whitewash Resolutions in share transactions.
2. **Alibaba Group:** In 2019, Alibaba issued a Whitewash Resolution as part of their strategic financial [restructuring](../r/restructuring.md) plan (https://www.alibabagroup.com).

## Conclusion

Whitewash Resolutions are an indispensable tool in the [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md) toolkit, allowing companies to execute transactions that would otherwise trigger burdensome [takeover](../t/takeover.md) provisions. While they [offer](../o/offer.md) significant advantages in terms of flexibility and cost savings, they also require careful navigation of regulatory and [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) approval processes. Understanding the intricacies of Whitewash Resolutions is crucial for corporate leaders, [finance](../f/finance.md) professionals, and shareholders alike to ensure optimal outcomes in M&A and [capital](../c/capital.md)-raising activities.

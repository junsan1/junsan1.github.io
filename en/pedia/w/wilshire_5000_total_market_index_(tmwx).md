# Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index (TMWX)

The Wilshire 5000 Total [Market Index](../m/market_index.md), commonly referred to simply as the Wilshire 5000, is a [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md)-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) [index](../i/index.md) that aims to measure the performance of all U.S.-headquartered [equity](../e/equity.md) securities with readily available price data. It is named after the Wilshire Associates, the [investment management](../i/investment_management.md), consulting, and technology [firm](../f/firm.md) that created it. Established in 1974, the Wilshire 5000 is often used as a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) to represent the entirety of the U.S. [stock market](../s/stock_market.md).

## Background and Creation

The Wilshire 5000 was created by Wilshire Associates in 1974 with the objective of providing a comprehensive measure of the U.S. [equity market](../e/equity_market.md). Unlike other indices that focus on specific sectors or types of [stocks](../s/stock.md), the Wilshire 5000 includes a broader [range](../r/range.md) of equities, thereby representing a fuller picture of [market](../m/market.md) performance. Although it originally began with approximately 5,000 [stocks](../s/stock.md), the number of constituents has fluctuated, and as of 2020, it includes about 3,500-4,000 [stocks](../s/stock.md) due to [market](../m/market.md) changes such as delistings, mergers, and acquisitions.

## Methodology

### Eligibility Criteria

The Wilshire 5000 includes any publicly traded company that meets the following criteria:
- The company is headquartered in the United States.
- The stock is [listed](../l/listed.md) on a major U.S. stock [exchange](../e/exchange.md), including the NYSE, [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md), or NYSE American.
- The stock has readily available price data.

### Calculation

The Wilshire 5000 is a [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md)-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) [index](../i/index.md). This means that each stock’s influence on the [index](../i/index.md) is proportional to its [market value](../m/market_value.md). The formula for calculating the [market](../m/market.md) cap of a company is:

\[ \text{[Market](../m/market.md) Cap} = \text{Share Price} \times \text{Number of Outstanding [Shares](../s/shares.md)} \]

The [index](../i/index.md) [value](../v/value.md) is then calculated by summing up the [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md) of all included [stocks](../s/stock.md) and dividing by a divisor, which normalizes the [index](../i/index.md) [value](../v/value.md).

### Rebalancing

The [index](../i/index.md) is rebalanced monthly to account for new listings, delistings, and corporate actions such as mergers and acquisitions. This ensures that the [index](../i/index.md) remains up-to-date and accurately reflects the current state of the [market](../m/market.md).

## Components of the Wilshire 5000

The Wilshire 5000 aims to be the broadest stock [market index](../m/market_index.md) and includes a variety of stock types:
- **[Large-cap stocks](../l/large_cap_stocks.md):** Major companies with large [market](../m/market.md) capitalizations, such as Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon.
- **[Mid-cap stocks](../m/mid-cap_stocks.md):** Companies with moderate [market](../m/market.md) capitalizations that are often growing and expanding.
- **Small-cap [stocks](../s/stock.md):** Smaller companies that may [offer](../o/offer.md) higher growth potential but come with higher [risk](../r/risk.md).
- **Micro-cap [stocks](../s/stock.md):** Very small companies that are often newer to the [market](../m/market.md) and carry significant [risk](../r/risk.md).

## Comparison with Other Indices

The Wilshire 5000 is unique in its breadth, but it is often compared to other major indices such as the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), and the [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md) Composite.

### S&P 500

The S&P 500 consists of 500 of the largest U.S. companies and is also [market](../m/market.md)-cap-[weighted](../w/weighted.md). It focuses on companies with large [market](../m/market.md) capitalizations and is less inclusive than the Wilshire 5000.

### Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)

The DJIA includes 30 large publicly-owned companies and is price-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) rather than [market](../m/market.md)-cap-[weighted](../w/weighted.md). This means that companies with a higher stock price have more influence on the DJIA's performance.

### NASDAQ Composite

The [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md) Composite includes over 3,000 [stocks](../s/stock.md) [listed](../l/listed.md) on the [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md) [exchange](../e/exchange.md). Because the [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md) has a heavy concentration of technology companies, the [NASDAQ](../n/nasdaq.md) Composite can be more tech-focused compared to the Wilshire 5000.

## Uses and Applications

### Benchmarking

Financial analysts and portfolio managers often use the Wilshire 5000 as a [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) to measure the performance of individual [stocks](../s/stock.md), mutual funds, and other investment vehicles. Because it includes a broad [range](../r/range.md) of securities, it is considered a [robust](../r/robust.md) [indicator](../i/indicator.md) of the overall [market](../m/market.md).

### Investment Products

Various mutual funds and [exchange](../e/exchange.md)-traded funds (ETFs) aim to replicate the performance of the Wilshire 5000. Examples include:
- **Vanguard Total [Stock Market](../s/stock_market.md) ETF (VTI):** Tracks the CRSP US Total [Market Index](../m/market_index.md), closely related to the Wilshire 5000.
- **[iShares](../i/ishares.md) Russell 3000 ETF (IWV):** Tracks the [Russell 3000 Index](../r/russell_3000_index.md), which includes the 3,000 largest U.S. [stocks](../s/stock.md) and is similar in breadth to the Wilshire 5000.

### Macroeconomic Analysis

Economists and policymakers may look at the Wilshire 5000 to gauge the health of the U.S. [economy](../e/economy.md). Because the [index](../i/index.md) includes companies from various sectors, it can provide insights into the performance of different economic segments.

## Performance

The performance of the Wilshire 5000 correlates closely with the overall U.S. [equity market](../e/equity_market.md). Historically, it has shown significant growth, particularly during [bull](../b/bull.md) markets, but also experiences declines during bear markets. 

### Historical Performance

#### 1980s-1990s

During the 1980s and 1990s, the Wilshire 5000 saw substantial growth due to economic [expansion](../e/expansion.md), technological advancements, and favorable [market](../m/market.md) conditions.

#### Dot-com Bubble and Burst (2000-2002)

In the early 2000s, the [index](../i/index.md) experienced a significant decline during the dot-com bubble burst, reflecting the losses in technology [stocks](../s/stock.md).

#### Global Financial Crisis (2007-2009)

The Wilshire 5000 experienced another sharp decline during the global [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md), losing considerable [value](../v/value.md) as markets around the world fell.

#### Post-crisis Recovery and Growth (2010-2020)

The [index](../i/index.md) saw one of its most [robust](../r/robust.md) periods of growth following the [financial crisis](../f/financial_crisis.md), driven by an extended [bull market](../b/bull_market.md), technological advancements, and strong corporate [earnings](../e/earnings.md).

## Criticisms and Limitations

### Over-representation of Large Companies

One criticism of the Wilshire 5000 is that it becomes very top-heavy due to its [market](../m/market.md)-cap-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) nature. Large companies like Apple and Microsoft have disproportionately large influence on the [index](../i/index.md).

### Inclusion Criteria

The requirement that companies be headquartered and [listed](../l/listed.md) in the U.S. excludes some globally significant [stocks](../s/stock.md), which can limit the [index](../i/index.md)’s comprehensiveness.

### Maintenance and Rebalancing

Constant maintenance, including monthly [rebalancing](../r/rebalancing.md), ensures the [index](../i/index.md) stays current, but it also means it may not fully capture short-term [market](../m/market.md) movements and inefficiencies.

## Real-time Tracking and Data Access

The Wilshire 5000 can be tracked in real-time via various financial news platforms and [stock market](../s/stock_market.md) websites. Investors and analysts who wish to follow the [index](../i/index.md) closely can rely on reputable data providers such as [Bloomberg](../b/bloomberg.md), [Reuters](../r/reuters.md), and Wilshire Associates themselves.

# Whole Life Annuity

A whole [life annuity](../l/life_annuity.md) is a financial product that provides a series of payments at regular intervals for the remainder of the [annuitant](../a/annuitant.md)'s life. These periodic payments can be made monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually. Whole life annuities are primarily used as a retirement [income](../i/income.md) strategy to ensure that individuals do not outlive their financial resources. This type of annuity can be viewed as a form of longevity [insurance](../i/insurance.md), given its potential to provide [income](../i/income.md) for life, thereby mitigating the [risk](../r/risk.md) of depleting savings in old age. 

### Types of Whole Life Annuities

Whole life annuities can be classified into several types based on factors like [premium](../p/premium.md) [payment](../p/payment.md) structure, number of lives covered, and the timing of retirement benefits. Here are the primary classifications:

1. **Immediate vs. Deferred Annuities**:
   - **Immediate Annuities**: These annuities start paying out almost immediately after a lump-sum [premium](../p/premium.md) is paid. The payments usually begin within one year of the initial investment.
   - **Deferred Annuities**: These annuities start paying out at a future date, which can be several years after the initial [premium](../p/premium.md) [payment](../p/payment.md). This allows the invested funds to grow [tax-deferred](../t/tax_deferred.md) before [annuitization](../a/annuitization.md).

2. **Single-Life vs. [Joint](../j/joint.md)-Life Annuities**:
   - **Single-Life Annuities**: These annuities provide payments for the lifetime of one individual.
   - **[Joint](../j/joint.md)-Life Annuities**: These annuities provide payments for the lifetimes of two individuals, typically spouses, ensuring that [income](../i/income.md) continues until the death of the second [annuitant](../a/annuitant.md).

3. **Fixed vs. Variable Annuities**:
   - **Fixed Annuities**: These annuities provide guaranteed payouts, which can be either fixed in amount or indexed to [inflation](../i/inflation.md).
   - **Variable Annuities**: These annuities provide payouts that vary based on the performance of [underlying](../u/underlying.md) investments, such as mutual funds. They [offer](../o/offer.md) potential for higher returns but come with increased [risk](../r/risk.md).

4. **With Guaranteed Periods**: A whole [life annuity](../l/life_annuity.md) can include a guaranteed period wherein payments are made even if the [annuitant](../a/annuitant.md) dies before the end of this period. This feature provides a mix of life [income](../i/income.md) and a guaranteed [return](../r/return.md) of [premium](../p/premium.md).

### Structure and Function

Whole life annuities operate in the following manner:

1. **[Accumulation Phase](../a/accumulation_phase.md)**: During this phase, the individual contributes premiums into the annuity, either as a lump sum or through periodic payments. For deferred annuities, this phase can last for several years until the [annuitant](../a/annuitant.md) opts to start receiving [income](../i/income.md).

2. **[Annuitization](../a/annuitization.md) Phase**: This is the [payout](../p/payout.md) phase during which the [annuitant](../a/annuitant.md) starts receiving regular payments from the annuity based on the original agreement. The [annuitant](../a/annuitant.md) can choose from various [payout](../p/payout.md) [options](../o/options.md), including life-only payments or [joint](../j/joint.md)-life payments with survivorship benefits.

### Key Features

- **Lifetime [Income](../i/income.md)**: The defining characteristic of a whole [life annuity](../l/life_annuity.md) is that it guarantees [income](../i/income.md) for the lifetime of the [annuitant](../a/annuitant.md).
- **Premiums**: These can be paid as a single lump sum or through [multiple](../m/multiple.md) periodic payments over time.
- **Tax Deferral**: The growth of investments within a whole [life annuity](../l/life_annuity.md) is generally [tax-deferred](../t/tax_deferred.md), meaning that [taxes](../t/taxes.md) are only paid upon [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md).
- **[Death Benefit](../d/death_benefit.md)**: Depending on the structure, a whole [life annuity](../l/life_annuity.md) might include a [death benefit](../d/death_benefit.md), which ensures that remaining funds are paid to the designated beneficiaries upon the [annuitant](../a/annuitant.md)’s death.
- **Customizable [Payout](../p/payout.md) [Options](../o/options.md)**: Annuitants can choose from a variety of [payout](../p/payout.md) structures, including fixed dollar amounts or variable payouts linked to investment performance.

### Advantages

1. **Guaranteed [Income](../i/income.md)**: Ensures a steady [income](../i/income.md) stream for life, reducing the [risk](../r/risk.md) of outliving one’s savings.
2. **Tax Advantages**: [Income](../i/income.md) grows [tax-deferred](../t/tax_deferred.md), only becoming taxable upon [withdrawal](../w/withdrawal.md).
3. **Financial [Security](../s/security.md)**: Provides a reliable and predictable [income](../i/income.md) stream which can aid in [financial planning](../f/financial_planning.md).
4. **[Inflation](../i/inflation.md) Protection**: Some whole life annuities are indexed to [inflation](../i/inflation.md), helping maintain [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) over time.
5. **Survivor Benefits**: [Joint](../j/joint.md)-life annuities can provide continued financial support to surviving spouses.

### Disadvantages

1. **Lack of [Liquidity](../l/liquidity.md)**: Funds in an annuity are generally not accessible without incurring penalties, making this a less flexible investment.
2. **Potential for Lower Returns**: Fixed annuities might [offer](../o/offer.md) lower returns compared to other investments such as [stocks](../s/stock.md) and mutual funds.
3. **Fees and Expenses**: Whole life annuities, especially variable and indexed [options](../o/options.md), can have high fees which erode the overall [return](../r/return.md).
4. **[Inflation](../i/inflation.md) [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: Fixed payouts can lose [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) over time if not appropriately indexed to [inflation](../i/inflation.md).

### Use in Retirement Planning

Whole life annuities are commonly used in [retirement planning](../r/retirement_planning.md) to provide a reliable [income](../i/income.md) stream. They can be particularly beneficial for individuals who are concerned about outliving their assets. By converting a portion of retirement savings into a whole [life annuity](../l/life_annuity.md), retirees can ensure a base level of [income](../i/income.md) to cover essential living expenses, complementing other sources of retirement [income](../i/income.md) such as [social security](../s/social_security.md) and pension benefits.

### Regulatory Aspects

In the United States, whole life annuities are regulated by state [insurance](../i/insurance.md) departments. Providers must comply with state regulations specific to annuities, which govern [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) requirements, pricing, and consumer protections. The National Association of [Insurance](../i/insurance.md) Commissioners (NAIC) provides model regulations, but implementation can vary by state.

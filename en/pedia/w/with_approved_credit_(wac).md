# With Approved Credit (WAC)

When navigating the complex landscape of [financing](../f/financing.md), particularly in large purchases such as vehicles or homes, the term "With Approved [Credit](../c/credit.md)" (WAC) frequently surfaces. This term is pivotal in the realm of consumer [finance](../f/finance.md), affecting [loan](../l/loan.md) approval, [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, and sometimes even the potential for [financing](../f/financing.md) altogether. WAC is a conditional [offer](../o/offer.md) subject to the financial institution’s approval process, which evaluates the [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) of the applicant. Understanding WAC is crucial for consumers seeking [financing](../f/financing.md) and for businesses that rely on extending [credit](../c/credit.md) to customers.

## Understanding WAC

**With Approved [Credit](../c/credit.md) (WAC)** refers to [financing](../f/financing.md) offers contingent upon the borrower meeting specific [credit](../c/credit.md) criteria set by the [lender](../l/lender.md). Essentially, it means that the terms of [financing](../f/financing.md) (including [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, [loan](../l/loan.md) amounts, and [repayment](../r/repayment.md) schedules) are only valid if the borrower’s [credit](../c/credit.md) application is approved by the [lender](../l/lender.md). Approval typically hinges on [credit](../c/credit.md) scores, [credit](../c/credit.md) history, [income](../i/income.md), and other financial metrics that demonstrate the borrower’s ability to repay the [loan](../l/loan.md).

### Key Features of WAC:

1. **[Creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md):** WAC offers are primarily determined by the borrower’s [credit score](../c/credit_score.md). Higher [credit](../c/credit.md) scores generally equate to better [financing](../f/financing.md) terms, while lower scores may result in less favorable terms or outright denial.

2. **Conditional Offers:** The terms advertised with WAC (e.g., low-[interest](../i/interest.md) rates or special promotions) are conditional. If the borrower’s [credit](../c/credit.md) doesn't meet the [lender](../l/lender.md)’s criteria, the proposed terms may shift.

3. **[Lender](../l/lender.md)’s Criteria:** Each [lender](../l/lender.md) has its own set of criteria for what constitutes approved [credit](../c/credit.md). This may include a variety of factors beyond just the [credit score](../c/credit_score.md), such as [debt](../d/debt.md)-to-[income](../i/income.md) ratio, employment history, and existing financial [obligations](../o/obligation.md).

4. **Application Process:** To take advantage of WAC offers, borrowers typically must complete a [credit](../c/credit.md) application and go through the [lender](../l/lender.md)’s approval process, which can include a hard [credit](../c/credit.md) inquiry that may temporarily affect their [credit score](../c/credit_score.md).

## WAC in Different Contexts

### Automotive Financing

In the automotive [industry](../i/industry.md), the phrase "With Approved [Credit](../c/credit.md)" is ubiquitous in advertisements and promotional materials. Dealerships often advertise vehicles with attractive [financing](../f/financing.md) offers, such as [zero percent](../z/zero_percent.md) APR or cash rebates, but these offers are only available "with approved [credit](../c/credit.md)."

- **[Interest](../i/interest.md) Rates:** Borrowers with excellent [credit](../c/credit.md) scores may qualify for the lowest [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, whereas those with poor [credit](../c/credit.md) may be offered higher rates or turned down for [credit](../c/credit.md) altogether.
- **[Loan](../l/loan.md) Terms:** The length of the [loan](../l/loan.md) term and the size of the monthly payments can also vary depending on the borrower’s [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md).
- **Promotions:** Special promotions are often tied to WAC, meaning they’re not universally available to all buyers, but only to those who meet the [credit](../c/credit.md) standards set by the [lender](../l/lender.md).

### Mortgage Financing

In the [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) realm, WAC is equally important as lenders evaluate the [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md) of potential homebuyers.

- **[Loan](../l/loan.md) Approval:** [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) lenders scrutinize [credit](../c/credit.md) scores, employment history, [income](../i/income.md), and existing [debt](../d/debt.md) when approving loans. 
- **[Interest](../i/interest.md) Rates:** Just like in automotive [financing](../f/financing.md), better [credit](../c/credit.md) leads to more favorable [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) rates.
- **[Loan](../l/loan.md) Amounts:** The amount a borrower can [finance](../f/finance.md) often hinges on their [creditworthiness](../c/creditworthiness.md), affecting their [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md).

### Retail Financing

Retailers, especially those [offering](../o/offering.md) large or expensive products like electronics or furniture, often provide [financing](../f/financing.md) [options](../o/options.md) with WAC.

- **[Deferred Interest](../d/deferred_interest.md):** Many retailers [offer](../o/offer.md) promotional [financing](../f/financing.md) with [deferred interest](../d/deferred_interest.md), contingent upon [credit](../c/credit.md) approval.
- **[Credit](../c/credit.md) Offers:** Store [credit](../c/credit.md) cards and [in-house financing](../i/in-house_financing.md) offers frequently reference WAC, setting specific [credit](../c/credit.md) thresholds for borrowers to meet.

## Assessing Creditworthiness

### Credit Scores

[Credit](../c/credit.md) scores are one of the most critical components in the evaluation process for WAC. The most commonly used [credit](../c/credit.md) scoring models include FICO and [VantageScore](../v/vantagescore.md), both of which [range](../r/range.md) from 300 to 850. Generally:

- **Excellent [Credit](../c/credit.md):** 750-850
- **[Good Credit](../g/good_credit.md):** 700-749
- **Fair [Credit](../c/credit.md):** 650-699
- **Poor [Credit](../c/credit.md):** 600-649
- **Very Poor [Credit](../c/credit.md):** 300-599

### Other Factors

Aside from [credit](../c/credit.md) scores, lenders look at various factors before extending [credit](../c/credit.md):

- **[Debt](../d/debt.md)-to-[Income](../i/income.md) Ratio (DTI):** This ratio compares the borrower’s monthly [debt](../d/debt.md) payments to their monthly [gross income](../g/gross_income.md).
- **Employment History:** Steady employment can indicate financial stability.
- **[Income](../i/income.md) Levels:** Higher [income](../i/income.md) can enhance the ability to repay larger loans.
- **[Credit](../c/credit.md) History:** A long, positive [credit](../c/credit.md) history can favor the borrower.
- **Existing [Debt](../d/debt.md):** Current financial [obligations](../o/obligation.md) are also considered.

## Implications of WAC for Consumers

### Benefits

- **Access to Better Rates:** Consumers with approved [credit](../c/credit.md) often benefit from lower [interest](../i/interest.md) rates and better [loan](../l/loan.md) terms.
- **Promotional Offers:** Qualifying for WAC can allow consumers to take advantage of special [financing](../f/financing.md) promotions.
- **Improved [Purchasing Power](../p/purchasing_power.md):** Approved [credit](../c/credit.md) can increase the amount a consumer is eligible to borrow.

### Challenges

- **[Credit Score](../c/credit_score.md) Impact:** The [credit](../c/credit.md) inquiry process can temporarily affect [credit](../c/credit.md) scores.
- **Exclusivity of Offers:** Attractive advertised terms may not be available to all consumers, causing potential disappointment.
- **[Debt](../d/debt.md) Management:** Mismanagement of [credit](../c/credit.md) and loans obtained through WAC can lead to increased [debt](../d/debt.md) and financial strain.

## WAC from a Business Perspective

### Customer Acquisition

For businesses, WAC is a tool to attract customers with the promise of competitive [financing](../f/financing.md) [options](../o/options.md). By advertising attractive WAC terms, businesses can draw in consumers who might be hesitant to make a purchase without the availability of [financing](../f/financing.md).

### Risk Assessment

Lenders and retailers rely on WAC to mitigate [risk](../r/risk.md). By extending [credit](../c/credit.md) only to those whose [credit](../c/credit.md) applications meet stringent criteria, businesses can safeguard against [loan](../l/loan.md) defaults and ensure more reliable [repayment](../r/repayment.md).

### Competitiveness

[Offering](../o/offering.md) favorable WAC terms can enhance a [business](../b/business.md)’s competitive edge in the marketplace. Consumers often shop around for the best [financing](../f/financing.md) terms, and businesses that provide attractive WAC offers are more likely to capture [market share](../m/market_share.md).

## Examples of Companies Utilizing WAC

[Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) lenders like [Quicken Loans](https://www.quickenloans.com/) use WAC to determine [loan](../l/loan.md) eligibility and terms, helping potential homeowners secure [financing](../f/financing.md).

### Retailers

Large retailers such as [Best Buy](https://www.bestbuy.com/) [offer](../o/offer.md) [in-house financing](../i/in-house_financing.md) [options](../o/options.md) and store [credit](../c/credit.md) cards with terms often subject to WAC, allowing customers to [finance](../f/finance.md) big-ticket items.

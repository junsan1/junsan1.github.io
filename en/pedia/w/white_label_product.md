# White Label Product

In the realm of [finance](../f/finance.md) and trading, the term "White Label Product" is synonymous with a pre-packaged, yet customizable service or product that is manufactured by one company but rebranded and sold by another. This [business](../b/business.md) strategy allows companies to [offer](../o/offer.md) a product without the overhead associated with production and development, which can be especially beneficial in the fast-paced and highly specialized world of financial technology (fintech) and [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) (algo-trading).

## Definition and Concept

A White Label Product is essentially a service or a product produced by one company and then rebranded by another to make it appear as if it were their own. This process is prevalent in several industries including [finance](../f/finance.md), software, [consumer goods](../c/consumer_goods.md), and more. The original producer sells the product to various companies, often with the capability for minor modifications, such as brand-specific packaging, labels, or software tweaks. The purchasing company then markets the product under its own brand as if it were a proprietary [offering](../o/offering.md).

In fintech and trading, white label solutions can encompass a wide array of offerings including trading platforms, [payment](../p/payment.md) gateways, financial software, and even entire banking systems.

1. **Speed to [Market](../m/market.md)**: Companies that choose white label solutions can quickly introduce a new product without the need for lengthy development cycles. This is particularly crucial in fintech where staying ahead of technological advancements is critical.

2. **Dependency on Supplier**: Businesses may become highly dependent on their suppliers for updates, maintenance, and support.

3. **Limited Control**: Customization [options](../o/options.md) may be limited, which can restrict the ability to make significant modifications based on specific [market](../m/market.md) demands.

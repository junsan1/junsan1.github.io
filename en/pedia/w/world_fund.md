# World Fund

World [Fund](../f/fund.md) is a term that could refer to various global investment initiatives, mutual funds, or [private equity](../p/private_equity.md) funds aimed at providing diversified exposure to international markets. This topic encompasses several key aspects, including the structure of these funds, their investment strategies, performance, regulatory environment, and their roles in global [finance](../f/finance.md).

## What is a World Fund?

World Funds are financial vehicles specifically designed to invest in a wide array of assets across different countries and regions. By diversifying their [holdings](../h/holdings.md) across [multiple](../m/multiple.md) markets, these funds aim to mitigate risks associated with [investing](../i/investing.md) in a single country or [industry](../i/industry.md). The term "World [Fund](../f/fund.md)" might refer to global mutual funds, [exchange](../e/exchange.md)-traded funds (ETFs), or private funds that seek to maximize returns through exposure to a diverse, international portfolio.

### Types of World Funds

1. **Global Mutual Funds**: These are [open](../o/open.md)-end funds that pool [money](../m/money.md) from [multiple](../m/multiple.md) investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of international securities. Global mutual funds are actively managed, meaning [fund](../f/fund.md) managers make decisions on purchasing and selling assets to [outperform](../o/outperform.md) [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) indices.

2. **[Exchange](../e/exchange.md)-Traded Funds (ETFs)**: These funds [offer](../o/offer.md) a passive investment option, usually tracking an international [index](../i/index.md) like the MSCI World [Index](../i/index.md) or the FTSE All-World [Index](../i/index.md). ETFs [trade](../t/trade.md) on stock exchanges, allowing investors to buy and sell [shares](../s/shares.md) throughout the trading day.

3. **[Private Equity](../p/private_equity.md) Funds**: These funds invest in private companies around the world. They usually follow a longer-term [investment horizon](../i/investment_horizon.md) and may engage in [venture capital](../v/venture_capital.md), buyouts, and other strategies to achieve their objectives.

4. **[Hedge](../h/hedge.md) Funds**: These are lightly regulated private investment vehicles that can employ various sophisticated strategies, including [leverage](../l/leverage.md), [short selling](../s/short_selling.md), and [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), to achieve high returns. [Hedge](../h/hedge.md) funds often invest globally to take advantage of anomalies and inefficiencies in different markets.

### Investment Strategies

World Funds employ various strategies to optimize returns and manage risks:

1. **Geographic [Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: By spreading investments across different countries, funds reduce exposure to political, economic, and social risks specific to any one country.

2. **Sector [Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: These funds often invest in [multiple](../m/multiple.md) sectors such as technology, healthcare, energy, and [consumer goods](../c/consumer_goods.md) to mitigate risks associated with [industry](../i/industry.md)-specific downturns.

3. **[Currency Hedging](../c/currency_hedging.md)**: To protect against unfavorable [currency exchange](../c/currency_exchange.md) movements, some World Funds employ [hedging strategies](../h/hedging_strategies.md) like [forward contracts](../f/forward_contracts.md) or [options](../o/options.md).

4. **[Active Management](../a/active_management.md)**: [Fund](../f/fund.md) managers actively select [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, and other securities based on in-depth [market](../m/market.md) analysis and research.

5. **Passive Management**: Some funds choose to mimic the performance of global indices through [passive investment strategies](../p/passive_investment_strategies.md).

### Performance Metrics

The performance of World Funds is typically evaluated using a variety of metrics, including:

1. **Net [Asset](../a/asset.md) [Value](../v/value.md) (NAV)**: This represents the total [value](../v/value.md) of a [fund](../f/fund.md)'s assets minus its liabilities, divided by the number of outstanding [shares](../s/shares.md). NAV is usually calculated daily for mutual funds.

2. **[Expense Ratio](../e/expense_ratio.md)**: This measures the total annual expenses of the [fund](../f/fund.md) (management fees, administrative fees, etc.) as a percentage of its average net assets.

3. **[Alpha](../a/alpha.md) and [Beta](../b/beta.md)**: [Alpha](../a/alpha.md) measures a [fund](../f/fund.md)â€™s performance relative to its [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md), while [Beta](../b/beta.md) indicates the [fund](../f/fund.md)'s sensitivity to [market](../m/market.md) movements.

4. **[Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md)**: This ratio measures the [risk-adjusted return](../r/risk-adjusted_return.md), helping investors understand how much [excess return](../e/excess_return.md) they are receiving for the additional [volatility](../v/volatility.md) endured by holding the [fund](../f/fund.md).

### Regulatory Environment

The regulatory landscape for World Funds varies by jurisdiction but generally aims to ensure [transparency](../t/transparency.md), protect investors, and maintain [market](../m/market.md) integrity.

1. **Securities and [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) [Commission](../c/commission.md) (SEC)**: In the United States, the SEC oversees various aspects of mutual funds and ETFs, including disclosures, [fund](../f/fund.md) advertising, and periodic reporting.

2. **European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA)**: In Europe, ESMA coordinates regulation and supervisory practices across member states.

3. **Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)**: In the UK, the FCA is responsible for regulating mutual funds, ETFs, and other investment vehicles.

## Earning Programs

WhiteBIT offers multiple earning programs for its users. These include staking, lending, and various promotional campaigns. Users can earn rewards by staking their assets on the platform or by participating in lending programs where they can loan their cryptocurrency for interest.

### Staking

Staking involves locking up your assets for a certain period in return for rewards. WhiteBIT offers a variety of staking options, ranging from flexible to fixed terms, providing users with multiple ways to earn passively.

### Lending

Lending programs allow users to earn interest on their crypto assets by lending them out to other traders. The interest rates are competitive, providing an additional stream of income for users.

The two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to user accounts.

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

The use of 2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide two forms of identification before accessing their accounts.

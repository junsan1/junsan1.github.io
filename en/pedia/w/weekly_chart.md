# Weekly Chart

A weekly chart is a type of financial chart that shows the price movements and trading volumes of a [financial asset](../f/financial_asset.md) over a week. This valuable tool is commonly employed by traders and investors for long-term analysis. By focusing on weekly data points, these charts help to filter out the [noise](../n/noise.md) of daily fluctuations, providing a clearer and more stable picture of an [asset](../a/asset.md)'s trends and patterns. Below, we explore the various elements, significance, and usage of weekly charts in trading and [finance](../f/finance.md).

### What is a Weekly Chart?

A weekly chart plots a [financial asset](../f/financial_asset.md)'s closing price for each week over a specified period. Unlike daily charts, where each bar or [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) represents a single day of trading, weekly charts condense this information into a single bar or [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) per week. This [aggregation](../a/aggregation.md) of data can help investors identify longer-term trends and reduce the impact of daily [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

### Components of a Weekly Chart

1. **Price Bars or Candlesticks**:
   - **[Open](../o/open.md), High, Low, Close (OHLC)**: Each bar or [candlestick](../c/candlestick.md) represents the price data for a particular week. 
   - **Candlesticks**: These include the body ([range](../r/range.md) between the [open](../o/open.md) and close prices) and the wicks (high and low prices). Bullish (price increased over the week) and bearish (price decreased over the week) candlesticks are typically different colors for easy identification.

2. **[Volume](../v/volume.md)**:
   - This represents the number of [shares](../s/shares.md) or contracts traded during the week. [Volume](../v/volume.md) bars are plotted along the bottom of the chart and can help indicate the strength of a price move.

3. **Time Axis**:
   - The horizontal axis represents time, with each interval typically marking a week.

4. **Price Axis**:
   - The vertical axis represents the price of the [asset](../a/asset.md).

### Why Use Weekly Charts?

#### Reduced Noise
- **Filtering Out Daily [Volatility](../v/volatility.md)**: Daily charts can show erratic price movements that can mislead traders. Weekly charts aggregate this data, making it easier to identify longer-term trends and avoid false breakouts or misleading signals.

#### Long-Term Trends
- **Identifying Major Trends**: Weekly charts are useful for spotting long-term trends that might be obscured in daily charts. This information can be critical for long-term investment strategies and for setting significant [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels.

#### Better Perspective
- **Larger [Market](../m/market.md) Movements**: Weekly charts provide a broader perspective on the [market](../m/market.md), making it easier to understand the broader [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) and [investor](../i/investor.md) behavior over longer periods.

### Technical Analysis Tools in Weekly Charts

#### Moving Averages
- **Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**: These are commonly overlaid on weekly charts to smooth out price data and identify trends.

#### Trendlines 
- **[Support and Resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) Lines**: Drawing trendlines on weekly charts can help in identifying long-term [support and resistance](../s/support_and_resistance.md) levels, which are crucial for making trading decisions.

#### Indicators
- **[Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index.md) (RSI), Moving Average Convergence [Divergence](../d/divergence.md) (MACD)**: These and other [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicator.md) can be applied to weekly charts to provide additional insights into the [asset](../a/asset.md)'s [momentum](../m/momentum.md), strength, and potential reversals.

### Strategies Utilizing Weekly Charts

#### Long-Term Investing
- **[Buy and Hold](../b/buy_and_hold.md)**: Investors looking to adopt a long-term "[buy and hold](../b/buy_and_hold.md)" strategy often rely on weekly charts to identify suitable entry points, [support levels](../s/support_levels.md), and long-term trends.
  
#### Swing Trading
- **Multi-Day Trades**: Swing traders often use weekly charts in conjunction with daily charts to determine the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [trend](../t/trend.md) that could influence their multi-[day trading](../d/day_trading.md) decisions.

#### Position Trading
- **Weeks to Months**: Position traders, who [hold](../h/hold.md) assets for weeks to months, find weekly charts invaluable for identifying [trend](../t/trend.md) continuity and potential reversing points.

### Weaknesses of Weekly Charts

#### Lagging Indicators
- **Delayed Signals**: Some indicators and trends identified on weekly charts may lag compared to daily charts, meaning they can provide delayed buy or sell signals.

#### Less Granular Detail
- **Missing Short-term Movements**: Weekly charts lack the granularity required for intraday or high-frequency [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). Important short-term events may be overlooked.

### Comparative Analyses

#### Weekly vs. Daily Charts
- **Granularity**: Daily charts [offer](../o/offer.md) more detailed views suitable for short-term trades, while weekly charts are better suited for long-term analysis.
- **[Noise](../n/noise.md)**: Weekly charts reduce [noise](../n/noise.md) and are generally more stable in terms of trends and signals compared to daily charts.
  
#### Weekly vs. Monthly Charts
- **Detail vs. [Scope](../s/scope.md)**: While monthly charts provide an even broader [scope](../s/scope.md), weekly charts [offer](../o/offer.md) a balanced perspective, giving traders a middle ground between detail and long-term [trend analysis](../t/trend_analysis.md).

### Real-world Applications

1. **[Equity](../e/equity.md) Markets**: Traders use weekly charts for [stocks](../s/stock.md) to identify long-term trends and make better-informed decisions about entering or exiting positions.
2. **Forex**: In the [foreign exchange](../f/foreign_exchange.md) [market](../m/market.md), weekly charts help traders understand the longer-term economic and geopolitical factors affecting [currency](../c/currency.md) movements.
3. **Commodities**: For commodities like gold, oil, and agricultural products, weekly charts are instrumental in identifying [supply](../s/supply.md) and [demand](../d/demand.md) trends over longer periods.
4. **Cryptocurrencies**: The highly volatile nature of cryptocurrencies makes weekly charts particularly useful for cutting through the [noise](../n/noise.md) and identifying sustainable trends.

### Case Study: Apple Inc. (AAPL)

Using a real-world example helps to understand the application of weekly charts. Let's consider Apple Inc. (AAPL). An [investor](../i/investor.md) examining a weekly chart for Apple might notice long-term trends such as:
- **Upward [Momentum](../m/momentum.md)**: Over the years, one can identify strong bullish trends.
- **Key [Support Levels](../s/support_levels.md)**: Historical weekly lows might serve as strong [support levels](../s/support_levels.md) in times of dips.
- **[Volume](../v/volume.md) Spikes**: Significant trading volumes during certain weeks, signaling key [investor](../i/investor.md) activity.

### Conclusion

Weekly charts are an essential tool in the arsenal of many traders and investors. They provide a clearer, longer-term perspective on price movements and trends while filtering out the [noise](../n/noise.md) associated with daily [volatility](../v/volatility.md). Despite their limitations, such as delayed signals and less granular detail, they serve as a powerful instrument for long-term [investing](../i/investing.md), [swing trading](../s/swing_trading.md), and position trading. Whether used to analyze equities, forex, commodities, or cryptocurrencies, weekly charts [offer](../o/offer.md) invaluable insights that can significantly impact [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) and investment decisions.

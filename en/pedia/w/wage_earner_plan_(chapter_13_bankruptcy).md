# Wage Earner Plan (Chapter 13 Bankruptcy)

Chapter 13 bankruptcy, often referred to as the Wage Earner's Plan, is a legal procedure in the United States bankruptcy code that allows individuals with a regular income to create a plan to repay all or part of their debts. Unlike Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which involves liquidating assets to pay creditors, Chapter 13 does not require the liquidation of assets. Instead, it allows debtors to keep their property and repay debts over a period of three to five years.

## Overview of Chapter 13 Bankruptcy

### Eligibility for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy

To be eligible for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, individuals must have a regular source of income sufficient to repay their debts according to a court-approved repayment plan. Debtors must also meet specific criteria regarding the amount of debt they owe:
- Secured debts (debts backed by collateral) must be less than $1,257,850.
- Unsecured debts (debts not backed by collateral) must be less than $419,275.

These limits are subject to periodic adjustments. Corporations and partnerships are not eligible for Chapter 13 bankruptcy.

### Filing for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy

The process begins by filing a petition with the bankruptcy court serving the area where the debtor lives. In addition to the petition, the debtor must file several forms, including:
- A list of assets and liabilities.
- A schedule of current income and expenditures.
- A statement of financial affairs.
- A schedule of executory contracts and unexpired leases.

The debtor must also provide a certificate of credit counseling and evidence of income received within the last 60 days. After filing the petition, an automatic stay goes into effect, preventing creditors from taking collection actions against the debtor or their property.

### Repayment Plan

The core element of Chapter 13 bankruptcy is the repayment plan, which outlines how the debtor will repay debts over three to five years. The length of the repayment plan typically depends on the debtor's income relative to the state median income:
- If the debtor's income is below the state median, the repayment plan will usually be for three years.
- If the debtor's income is above the state median, the repayment plan will generally be for five years.

The plan must provide for the full repayment of priority debts, such as taxes and child support. Secured debts, such as mortgages and car loans, must also be paid in full to retain the collateral. Unsecured debts are typically repaid in part, depending on the debtor's disposable income and the value of nonexempt assets.

### Confirmation and Execution of the Plan

After the repayment plan is filed, a confirmation hearing is held, usually within 45 days. During this hearing, the bankruptcy judge evaluates whether the plan meets legal requirements and is feasible. Creditors may object to the plan, but if the court finds the plan satisfactory, it will be confirmed.

Once the plan is confirmed, the debtor must begin making payments to a court-appointed trustee responsible for distributing the funds to creditors. The debtor must adhere to the plan's terms for the duration of the repayment period.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages of Chapter 13 Bankruptcy

- **Asset Protection**: One of the most significant advantages of Chapter 13 is that it allows debtors to keep their property, including homes and cars, as long as they continue to make payments according to the repayment plan.
- **Controlled Repayment**: Chapter 13 provides a structured repayment plan, offering debtors a clear path to becoming debt-free.
- **Automatic Stay**: The automatic stay prevents creditors from pursuing collection actions, including foreclosure and repossession, providing debtors with temporary relief from financial pressure.
- **Credit Score Recovery**: Successfully completing a Chapter 13 plan can help debtors rebuild their credit over time, as opposed to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy that remains on a credit report for ten years.

### Disadvantages of Chapter 13 Bankruptcy

- **Long-Term Commitment**: The repayment period under Chapter 13 can be as long as five years, requiring sustained financial discipline and adherence to the plan.
- **Potential for Plan Failure**: If the debtor fails to make payments as outlined in the plan, the case may be dismissed, and creditors may resume collection actions.
- **Impact on Credit**: Although less severe than Chapter 7, Chapter 13 bankruptcy still affects the debtor's credit score and remains on their credit report for seven years.

## Conclusion

Chapter 13 bankruptcy, or the Wage Earner's Plan, offers individuals with a regular income a mechanism to manage and repay their debts without surrendering their assets. By creating a structured repayment plan and ensuring adherence to it, debtors can achieve financial stability and work toward clearing their debts. Though it carries both advantages and disadvantages, Chapter 13 provides a viable alternative to those seeking relief from overwhelming debt while retaining ownership of their assets.

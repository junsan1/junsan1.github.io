# Wage Earner Plan (Chapter 13 Bankruptcy)

Chapter 13 [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md), often referred to as the Wage Earner's Plan, is a legal procedure in the United States [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) code that allows individuals with a regular [income](../i/income.md) to create a plan to repay all or part of their debts. Unlike Chapter 7 [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md), which involves liquidating assets to pay creditors, Chapter 13 does not require the [liquidation](../l/liquidation.md) of assets. Instead, it allows debtors to keep their property and repay debts over a period of three to five years.

## Overview of Chapter 13 Bankruptcy

### Eligibility for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy

To be eligible for Chapter 13 [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md), individuals must have a regular source of [income](../i/income.md) sufficient to repay their debts according to a court-approved [repayment](../r/repayment.md) plan. Debtors must also meet specific criteria regarding the amount of [debt](../d/debt.md) they owe:
- Secured debts (debts backed by [collateral](../c/collateral.md)) must be less than $1,257,850.
- Unsecured debts (debts not backed by [collateral](../c/collateral.md)) must be less than $419,275.

These limits are subject to periodic adjustments. Corporations and partnerships are not eligible for Chapter 13 [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md).

### Filing for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy

The process begins by filing a petition with the [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) court serving the area where the debtor lives. In addition to the petition, the debtor must file several forms, including:
- A list of assets and liabilities.
- A schedule of current [income](../i/income.md) and expenditures.
- A statement of financial affairs.
- A schedule of executory contracts and unexpired leases.

The debtor must also provide a certificate of [credit](../c/credit.md) counseling and evidence of [income](../i/income.md) received within the last 60 days. After filing the petition, an automatic stay goes into effect, preventing creditors from taking collection actions against the debtor or their property.

### Repayment Plan

The core element of Chapter 13 [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) is the [repayment](../r/repayment.md) plan, which outlines how the debtor [will](../w/will.md) repay debts over three to five years. The length of the [repayment](../r/repayment.md) plan typically depends on the debtor's [income](../i/income.md) relative to the state [median](../m/median.md) [income](../i/income.md):
- If the debtor's [income](../i/income.md) is below the state [median](../m/median.md), the [repayment](../r/repayment.md) plan [will](../w/will.md) usually be for three years.
- If the debtor's [income](../i/income.md) is above the state [median](../m/median.md), the [repayment](../r/repayment.md) plan [will](../w/will.md) generally be for five years.

The plan must provide for the full [repayment](../r/repayment.md) of priority debts, such as [taxes](../t/taxes.md) and child support. Secured debts, such as mortgages and car loans, must also be paid in full to retain the [collateral](../c/collateral.md). Unsecured debts are typically repaid in part, depending on the debtor's [disposable income](../d/disposable_income.md) and the [value](../v/value.md) of nonexempt assets.

### Confirmation and Execution of the Plan

After the [repayment](../r/repayment.md) plan is filed, a confirmation hearing is held, usually within 45 days. During this hearing, the [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) judge evaluates whether the plan meets legal requirements and is feasible. Creditors may object to the plan, but if the court finds the plan satisfactory, it [will](../w/will.md) be confirmed.

Once the plan is confirmed, the debtor must begin making payments to a court-appointed [trustee](../t/trustee.md) responsible for distributing the funds to creditors. The debtor must adhere to the plan's terms for the [duration](../d/duration.md) of the [repayment](../r/repayment.md) period.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages of Chapter 13 Bankruptcy

- **[Asset Protection](../a/asset_protection.md)**: One of the most significant advantages of Chapter 13 is that it allows debtors to keep their property, including homes and cars, as long as they continue to make payments according to the [repayment](../r/repayment.md) plan.
- **Controlled [Repayment](../r/repayment.md)**: Chapter 13 provides a structured [repayment](../r/repayment.md) plan, [offering](../o/offering.md) debtors a clear path to becoming [debt](../d/debt.md)-free.
- **Automatic Stay**: The automatic stay prevents creditors from pursuing collection actions, including [foreclosure](../f/foreclosure.md) and repossession, providing debtors with temporary relief from financial pressure.
- **[Credit Score](../c/credit_score.md) Recovery**: Successfully completing a Chapter 13 plan can help debtors rebuild their [credit](../c/credit.md) over time, as opposed to a Chapter 7 [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) that remains on a [credit report](../c/credit_report.md) for ten years.

### Disadvantages of Chapter 13 Bankruptcy

- **Long-Term Commitment**: The [repayment](../r/repayment.md) period under Chapter 13 can be as long as five years, requiring sustained financial discipline and adherence to the plan.
- **Potential for Plan Failure**: If the debtor fails to make payments as outlined in the plan, the case may be dismissed, and creditors may [resume](../r/resume.md) collection actions.
- **Impact on [Credit](../c/credit.md)**: Although less severe than Chapter 7, Chapter 13 [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md) still affects the debtor's [credit score](../c/credit_score.md) and remains on their [credit report](../c/credit_report.md) for seven years.

## Conclusion

Chapter 13 [bankruptcy](../b/bankruptcy.md), or the Wage Earner's Plan, offers individuals with a regular [income](../i/income.md) a mechanism to manage and repay their debts without surrendering their assets. By creating a structured [repayment](../r/repayment.md) plan and ensuring adherence to it, debtors can achieve financial stability and work toward [clearing](../c/clearing.md) their debts. Though it carries both advantages and disadvantages, Chapter 13 provides a viable alternative to those seeking relief from overwhelming [debt](../d/debt.md) while retaining ownership of their assets.

# Wilder's Directional Movement Index (DMI)

The Directional Movement [Index](../i/index.md) (DMI), developed by J. Welles Wilder, is a technical [indicator](../i/indicator.md) that estimates the strength and direction of a [trend](../t/trend.md). It aids in identifying whether a [security](../s/security.md) is trending and how strong that [trend](../t/trend.md) is. Traders often use DMI to make trading decisions and to develop [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md).

## Components of DMI

The DMI consists of three lines:
1. **+DI (Positive Directional [Indicator](../i/indicator.md))**: Measures the strength of the upward movement.
2. **-DI (Negative Directional [Indicator](../i/indicator.md))**: Measures the strength of the downward movement.
3. **ADX ([Average Directional Index](../a/average_directional_index_(adx).md))**: Calculates the absolute strength of the [trend](../t/trend.md), regardless of direction.

### +DI and -DI Calculation

To calculate +DI and -DI, you must first determine the Directional Movement (DM) for each period:

1. **Calculate UpMove and DownMove**:
    - **UpMove** = Current High - Previous High
    - **DownMove** = Previous Low - Current Low

2. **Determine Positive and Negative Directional Movement**:
    - If UpMove > DownMove and UpMove > 0: +DM = UpMove
    - If DownMove > UpMove and DownMove > 0: -DM = DownMove
    - If neither condition is met, +DM = 0 and -DM = 0

3. **Calculate the True [Range](../r/range.md) (TR)**:
    - TR is the greatest of the following:
        - Current High - Current Low
        - Absolute [Value](../v/value.md) of Current High - Previous Close
        - Absolute [Value](../v/value.md) of Current Low - Previous Close

4. **Smoothed +DM, -DM, and TR**:
    - Use a smoothing technique (commonly a 14-period average).

5. **+DI and -DI**:
    - +DI = (Smoothed +DM / Smoothed TR) * 100
    - -DI = (Smoothed -DM / Smoothed TR) * 100

### ADX Calculation

1. **Calculate the Directional Movement [Index](../i/index.md) (DX)**:
    - DX = (| +DI - -DI | / (+DI + -DI)) * 100

2. **Calculate ADX**:
    - The ADX is the smoothed average of DX values over a specified period (commonly 14 periods).

## Interpreting DMI

### Crossovers

The +DI and -DI lines can be used in crossover strategies:
- **Bullish Signal**: When +DI crosses above -DI, it indicates a potentially bullish [trend](../t/trend.md).
- **Bearish Signal**: When -DI crosses above +DI, it indicates a potentially bearish [trend](../t/trend.md).

### ADX Trend Strength

- **ADX below 20**: Weak or non-existent [trend](../t/trend.md).
- **ADX above 20**: Indicates the presence of a [trend](../t/trend.md).
- **ADX above 40**: Indicates a strong [trend](../t/trend.md).

## Applications in Trading Strategies

### Trend Following

When ADX is above 20, traders often use the DMI for [trend](../t/trend.md)-following strategies:
- Enter long positions when +DI crosses above -DI if ADX is rising.
- Enter short positions when -DI crosses above +DI if ADX is rising.

### Range Bound Strategies

When ADX is below 20, it may be an indication of a [range](../r/range.md)-bound [market](../m/market.md). Strategies such as oscillators or mean-reversion techniques are more suitable.

## Limitations of DMI

1. **[Lagging Indicator](../l/lagging_indicator.md)**: The DMI relies on historical data, so it may not respond quickly to sudden price changes.
2. **[False Signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md)**: In highly volatile markets, DMI can produce [false signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md).
3. **Complexity**: The calculation of DMI involves [multiple](../m/multiple.md) steps, making it somewhat complex for beginners.

## Conclusion

The Directional Movement [Index](../i/index.md) is a powerful and versatile tool for assessing [trend](../t/trend.md) strength and direction. While it has its limitations, when combined with other indicators and sound trading principles, it can significantly enhance trading decisions.

# Working Tax Credit (WTC)

## Overview
Working [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md) (WTC) is a state benefit in the United Kingdom that supplements the [earnings](../e/earnings.md) of low-[income](../i/income.md) workers. It aims to provide financial support to individuals both in and out of employment, ensuring that work pays more than [welfare](../w/welfare.md). The system is designed to assist those who are working but still face financial hardship due to low wages.

## Eligibility Criteria
Eligibility for WTC depends on several factors including age, hours worked, [income](../i/income.md) level, and whether the claimant has children or a disability. Here's a breakdown:

### Age and Working Hours
- **Aged 25 or over**: Must work a minimum of 30 hours per week.
- **Aged 16-24 with a child**: Must work at least 16 hours per week.
- **Aged 16 or over with a disability**: Required to work at least 16 hours per week.
- **Couples with children**: Combined to work at least 24 hours per week, with one of them working at least 16 hours.

### Income Thresholds
[Income](../i/income.md) thresholds vary depending on circumstances such as whether the claimant has children or disabilities. Generally, the lower the [income](../i/income.md), the higher the [tax credit](../t/tax_credit.md).

### Disability Element
For disabled workers, an additional amount can be claimed to account for the extra costs often associated with living with a disability.

## Calculation of WTC
The Working [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md) is calculated based on the claimant's [income](../i/income.md) and circumstances. The [credit](../c/credit.md) consists of several components:

1. **Basic Element**: Paid to all eligible claimants.
2. **Couple's Element**: An additional amount for couples.
3. **Lone Parent Element**: Extra support for single parents.
4. **30-hour Element**: Paid to those working 30 hours or more a week.
5. **Disability Element**: Additional support for those with disabilities.
6. **Severe Disability Element**: For those who receive disability benefits indicating severe disability.

## WTC Payment Structure
Payments are typically made directly into [bank](../b/bank.md) accounts and are divided into regular installments.

## Renewal and Changes
Claimants need to renew their application annually and report any changes in circumstances such as:

1. **Changes in working hours**.
2. **Changes in [household income](../h/household_income.md)**.
3. **Changes in disability status**.
4. **Changes in child care costs**.

Failure to report changes may result in overpayments which have to be repaid or underpayments that affect the level of support received.

## Interaction with Other Benefits
WTC can be received alongside other benefits such as [Child Tax Credit](../c/child_tax_credit.md) (CTC), Housing Benefit, and Childcare Vouchers. The interaction with other benefits should be closely monitored as it can affect the total [income](../i/income.md) support received.

## Recent Changes and Universal Credit
The introduction of Universal [Credit](../c/credit.md) (UC) is gradually replacing Working [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md). Universal [Credit](../c/credit.md) combines six means-tested benefits including WTC into a single [payment](../p/payment.md):

1. **[Income](../i/income.md)-based Jobseekerâ€™s Allowance (JSA)**.
2. **[Income](../i/income.md)-related Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)**.
3. **[Income](../i/income.md) Support**.
4. **Housing Benefit**.
5. **[Child Tax Credit](../c/child_tax_credit.md) (CTC)**.
6. **Working [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md) (WTC)**.

Claimants currently receiving WTC may be migrated to Universal [Credit](../c/credit.md) as the system continues to be rolled out.

## Significance
WTC serves as a vital lifeline for low-[income](../i/income.md) earners, helping to bridge the gap between [income](../i/income.md) and living expenses. It not only alleviates [poverty](../p/poverty.md) but also incentivizes employment, contributing to overall economic stability.

## Conclusion
Working [Tax Credit](../t/tax_credit.md) is an important financial support mechanism designed to uplift low-[income](../i/income.md) workers in the UK. Its multifaceted approach, considering various elements like disability and working hours, makes it a comprehensive tool for social [welfare](../w/welfare.md). As the system transitions to Universal [Credit](../c/credit.md), the core principles of providing financial assistance to those in need remain integral to supporting the workforce.

The Warsaw Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (WSE), known in Polish as Giełda Papierów Wartościowych w Warszawie (GPW), is a key financial institution in Poland and one of the most prominent stock exchanges in Central and Eastern Europe. Established on April 16, 1991, following the fall of [communism](../c/communism.md), the WSE has played a critical role in the country's transition to a [market economy](../m/market_economy.md). This article delves into the history, structure, and functioning of the WSE, its [market](../m/market.md) segments, trading mechanisms, key indices, and its role in the regional and global financial landscape.

## History and Evolution

### Establishment and Early Years

The Warsaw Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) was officially established on April 16, 1991, marking the rebirth of a [capital](../c/capital.md) [market](../m/market.md) in Poland after the end of the communist regime. The first [trading session](../t/trading_session.md) took place with seven companies [listed](../l/listed.md), a modest beginning for what would become a pivotal institution in Poland's economic transformation.

Prior to 1989, Poland's financial [market](../m/market.md) [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) was virtually non-existent due to the centralized planning of the communist era. The re-establishment of the WSE was part of broader economic reforms aimed at transitioning to a [market](../m/market.md)-oriented [economy](../e/economy.md), which included the [privatization](../p/privatization.md) of state-owned enterprises and the development of a legal and regulatory framework for [capital markets](../c/capital_markets.md).

### Growth and Development

Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, the WSE experienced rapid growth. The number of [listed](../l/listed.md) companies increased significantly, and the [exchange](../e/exchange.md) introduced new financial instruments and [trading systems](../t/trading_systems.md) to cater to the growing [demand](../d/demand.md). Key milestones during this period include:

- **1994**: Introduction of the electronic trading system WARSET.
- **1998**: Launch of the first [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) [market](../m/market.md).
- **2000**: Introduction of the WSE [Index](../i/index_instrument.md) (WIG), the main [market index](../m/market_index.md).

The [expansion](../e/expansion.md) was also supported by Poland's accession to the [European Union](../e/european_union_(eu).md) in 2004, which brought about increased [investor](../i/investor.md) confidence and integration with European [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

### Modern Era

In recent years, the WSE has continued to evolve, embracing technological advancements and expanding its product offerings. Key developments include:

- **2010**: Introduction of the Universal [Trading Platform](../t/trading_platform.md) (UTP), developed in cooperation with NYSE [Euronext](../e/euronext.md), which significantly enhanced trading speed and capacity.
- **2013**: Launch of the NewConnect [market](../m/market.md) for small and medium-sized enterprises.
- **2015**: Introduction of a new segment for high-growth companies, highlighting the [exchange](../e/exchange.md)'s commitment to supporting innovation.

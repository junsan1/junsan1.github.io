# Weighted Beta

Within the domain of [finance](../f/finance.md) and, more specifically, [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), the concept of [beta](../b/beta.md) is crucial for understanding the [risk](../r/risk.md) behavior of [stocks](../s/stock.md) in relation to the [market](../m/market.md). [Beta](../b/beta.md) (β) measures the [volatility](../v/volatility.md) of an individual [security](../s/security.md) or portfolio in comparison to the entire [market](../m/market.md), providing insights into its [systematic risk](../s/systematic_risk.md). [Weighted](../w/weighted.md) [beta](../b/beta.md), a nuanced adaptation of [beta](../b/beta.md), allows traders and analysts to refine their [risk](../r/risk.md) assessment and strategy development by taking into account the relative size or importance of assets or factors in their portfolio.

### Understanding Beta

To comprehend the significance of [weighted](../w/weighted.md) [beta](../b/beta.md), it is essential first to understand conventional [beta](../b/beta.md). Here is a quick overview:
- **Standard [Beta](../b/beta.md) Calculation:** [Beta](../b/beta.md) is calculated through a [regression analysis](../r/regression_analysis.md) comparing the returns of the [security](../s/security.md) to the returns of the [market](../m/market.md). Mathematically, it is the [covariance](../c/covariance.md) of the [security](../s/security.md)'s returns and the [market](../m/market.md)'s returns divided by the variance of the [market](../m/market.md)'s returns.
    \[
    \[beta](../b/beta.md) = \frac{\text{Cov}(R_i, R_m)}{\text{Var}(R_m)}
    \]
    Where:
    - \( R_i \) = [Return](../r/return.md) on the individual [security](../s/security.md)
    - \( R_m \) = [Return](../r/return.md) on the [market](../m/market.md)
    - Cov = [Covariance](../c/covariance.md)
    - Var = Variance

### Approach to Weighted Beta

[Weighted](../w/weighted.md) [beta](../b/beta.md) expands on this foundation by assigning weights to individual securities or factors based on their significance in a portfolio. This can be particularly useful for diversified portfolios, allowing algorithmic traders to more accurately calculate and manage [risk](../r/risk.md) exposure. Here, weights might be associated with aspects such as [market capitalization](../m/market_capitalization.md), trading [volume](../v/volume.md), or other fundamental factors reflecting the [security](../s/security.md)'s relative importance.

### Calculation of Weighted Beta

1. **Determine Individual Betas:** Calculate the [beta](../b/beta.md) for each individual [security](../s/security.md) in the portfolio.

2. **Assign Weights:** Assign weights to each [security](../s/security.md) based on selected criteria, such as the proportion of the total investment in the [security](../s/security.md).

3. **Aggregate the Betas:** Multiply each [security](../s/security.md)'s [beta](../b/beta.md) by its assigned weight and sum these products to derive the [weighted](../w/weighted.md) [beta](../b/beta.md) of the portfolio.

    \[
    \beta_{[weighted](../w/weighted.md)} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (w_i \cdot \beta_i)
    \]
    Where:
    - \( \beta_{[weighted](../w/weighted.md)} \) = [Weighted](../w/weighted.md) [beta](../b/beta.md) of the portfolio
    - \( w_i \) = Weight of the i-th [security](../s/security.md)
    - \( \beta_i \) = [Beta](../b/beta.md) of the i-th [security](../s/security.md)
    - \( n \) = Total number of securities in the portfolio

### Practical Example

Consider a simplified portfolio with three securities:

| [Security](../s/security.md) |   Investment ($) | Weight \( w_i \) | Individual [Beta](../b/beta.md) \( \beta_i \) | Contributing [Weighted](../w/weighted.md) [Beta](../b/beta.md) \( w_i \cdot \beta_i \)  |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| A        |         10,000 |             0.5 |                  1.2 |                             0.60 |
| B        |          6,000 |             0.3 |                 -0.4 |                             -0.12|
| C        |          4,000 |             0.2 |                  1.8 |                             0.36 |
| **Total**| **20,000**     |        **1.0**  |                      |                             **0.84**|

In this example, the [weighted](../w/weighted.md) [beta](../b/beta.md) of the portfolio is 0.84.

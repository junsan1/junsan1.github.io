# When Issued (WI)

When Issued (WI) is a term used in financial contexts to describe a situation where a new issue of securities, such as stocks or bonds, is authorized but not yet actually issued or delivered. These securities are traded on a conditional basis, meaning the actual trade will only be completed if and when the securities are officially issued. The term is particularly common in the contexts of treasury securities, initial public offerings (IPOs), and other new issues.

## Definition and Mechanics

### Preliminary Sale

When securities are sold on a WI basis, the transactions are contingent. This means that the buyer and seller agree to a deal, but the completion of the transaction is dependent on the new issue being approved and actually becoming available. This mechanism allows for price discovery and provides investors a chance to trade the new issue even before it becomes available. It is a sort of forward contract where the actual instruments are yet to be created.

### Conditional Nature

The transactions under a WI basis are conditional based on certain terms and events. If the conditions are not met—for instance, if a regulatory body does not approve the issuance—the trade will not be settled, and both buyers and sellers will essentially be released from the contract. In the time leading up to the issuance, various factors can influence the price of the WI securities, including market conditions, investor sentiment, and announcements from the issuing entity.

### Regulation

Trading on a WI basis is subject to regulation to ensure fair practices. In the United States, for example, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) oversee WI trading to protect investors and ensure market transparency. Specific rules govern the disclosure, trading, and settlement conditions for WI securities.

## Applications of WI Trading

### Treasury Securities

WI trading is prevalent in the U.S. Treasury market. When the Treasury announces a new issue of bonds, notes, or bills, these instruments often begin trading on a WI basis. This pre-issuance trading can help to gauge market demand and establish a preliminary price for the securities. As a result, by the time the securities are officially issued, there might already be an established market price, promoting liquidity and efficiency.

Details on U.S. Treasury securities and WI trading specifics can be found on the U.S. Department of the Treasury's [official website](https://www.treasury.gov).

### Initial Public Offerings (IPOs)

In the context of IPOs, WI trading allows investors to begin trading shares of a company before its stock officially goes public. This can be especially useful for gauging investor interest and establishing an initial market price for the company's shares. IPO WI transactions are typically contingent upon the official issuance date and confirmatory actions from both the regulatory bodies and the issuing company.

### Corporate Bonds

Much like with government securities, new issues of corporate bonds may also trade on a WI basis. Companies might announce a new debt issuance, and these bonds can trade conditionally before they are formally issued. This practice helps to facilitate price discovery and manage investment risks associated with new debt offerings.

## Risk Considerations

### Execution Risk

Execution risk is one of the primary concerns in WI trading. Given that WI transactions are conditional, there's a risk that the new securities might never be issued. Investors holding WI securities may face the potential of trade cancellations, impacting their investment strategies and possibly leading to opportunity costs.

### Market Risk

WI securities are still subject to market risk, meaning that fluctuations in the broad market or in the specific issuer's perceived creditworthiness can affect the WI security's price. For instance, adverse news about an issuing company or a government can lead to notable price volatility in WI markets.

### Settlement Risk

Settlement risk, also known as counterparty risk, is inherent in WI transactions as with other forms of trading. The risk comes into play if one party, either the buyer or the seller, fails to fulfill their obligations once the security is issued. Regulatory frameworks often stipulate measures to mitigate these risks, such as margin requirements.

## Benefits of WI Trading

### Price Discovery

One of the main advantages of WI trading is the price discovery it facilitates. WI trading allows market participants to gauge demand and establish an initial pricing benchmark for new securities. This can help in smoother transitions once the securities are formally issued.

### Liquidity

WI trading promotes liquidity by creating an active market for securities even before they are issued. This liquidity is beneficial to investors who wish to enter or exit positions rapidly, helping to stabilize market conditions around new issues.

### Risk Management

Investors can use WI trading for hedging purposes or to manage their portfolios more effectively. By engaging in WI transactions, institutional and retail investors can manage the risk associated with new issuances ahead of time, potentially hedging against interest rate risks or other market fluctuations.

## Conclusion

When Issued trading is a crucial aspect of modern financial markets. It allows for conditional trading of securities that are yet to be issued, providing key benefits such as price discovery, liquidity, and risk management. Despite its advantages, WI trading also carries certain risks, including execution, market, and settlement risks. Regulatory oversight ensures fair practices and mitigates some of these inherent risks, promoting an efficient and transparent trading environment.

The continued evolution and regulation of WI trading will likely play a significant role in the fluidity and robustness of global financial markets.

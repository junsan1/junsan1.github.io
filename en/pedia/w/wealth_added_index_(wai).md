# Wealth Added Index (WAI)

The [Wealth](../w/wealth.md) Added [Index](../i/index.md) (WAI) is a performance measure used to evaluate the [value](../v/value.md) created by a [business](../b/business.md) for its shareholders over a specified period. The [principal](../p/principal.md) idea behind the WAI is to determine whether the management of a company is generating returns that exceed the costs of [capital employed](../c/capital_employed.md) in the [business](../b/business.md). This method integrates both [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) and the [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md), making it a comprehensive tool to assess true economic profitability.

## Definition

WAI is defined as the excess of the [earnings](../e/earnings.md) generated by the company over the minimum required [return](../r/return.md) demanded by the investors. It can be summarized by the following formula:

\[ \text{WAI} = NOPAT - (WACC \times CE) \]

Where:
- NOPAT: Net [Operating Profit](../o/operating_profit.md) After [Taxes](../t/taxes.md)
- WACC: [Weighted Average](../w/weighted_average.md) [Cost of Capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md)
- CE: [Capital Employed](../c/capital_employed.md)

In essence, WAI measures how much [wealth](../w/wealth.md) a company has added for its shareholders above the basic threshold [return](../r/return.md) they expect. A positive WAI signifies that the company is creating [wealth](../w/wealth.md), whereas a negative WAI means that the company is destroying [value](../v/value.md).


## Components

### Net Operating Profit After Taxes (NOPAT)
NOPAT is a measure of the [profit](../p/profit.md) that a company generates from its operations after [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for [taxes](../t/taxes.md) but before [financing](../f/financing.md) costs and non-operating gains and losses. It represents the profitability from core [business](../b/business.md) operations, making it a crucial component in calculating WAI.

### Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)
WACC is the average [rate of return](../r/rate_of_return.md) a company is expected to pay its [security](../s/security.md) holders to [finance](../f/finance.md) its assets. It is computed by taking the proportion of each component of the [capital structure](../c/capital_structure.md) ([debt](../d/debt.md), [equity](../e/equity.md), etc.), and then multiplying by the required [rate of return](../r/rate_of_return.md) for each component. WACC reflects the [opportunity cost](../o/opportunity_cost.md) of the company’s [capital](../c/capital.md) and the [inherent risk](../i/inherent_risk.md) in the [business](../b/business.md).

### Capital Employed (CE)
[Capital Employed](../c/capital_employed.md) refers to the total amount of [capital](../c/capital.md) that has been used for the [acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) of profits. This includes [equity](../e/equity.md) [capital](../c/capital.md), [debt](../d/debt.md) [capital](../c/capital.md), and other long-term funding sources. Essentially, it represents the total long-term funding of a company.

## Significance of WAI

[Wealth](../w/wealth.md) Added [Index](../i/index.md) provides a very transparent and comprehensive way of measuring the [value](../v/value.md) that management is adding to or destroying for shareholders. Here are some of the major advantages of using WAI:

1. **Harmonizes Performance With [Capital](../c/capital.md) Costs**: Unlike traditional [accounting](../a/accounting.md) metrics which might show profitability without considering the [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md), WAI integrates this crucial element, giving a more accurate picture of economic profitability.

2. **Management Accountability**: WAI directly holds the management accountable for utilizing the company’s resources efficiently. By focusing on this measure, companies can align management's objectives with those of shareholders.

3. **Investment Decisions**: Provides a clear [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) for evaluating investment decisions and [capital](../c/capital.md) projects. Projects that are expected to [yield](../y/yield.md) a positive WAI are potentially [value](../v/value.md)-creating, while those with a negative WAI might be reconsidered.

4. **[Performance Benchmarking](../p/performance_benchmarking.md)**: Helps in comparing the performance of different companies or [business](../b/business.md) units within a company. It ensures that the comparison takes into account the relative costs of [capital](../c/capital.md), making it a fairer assessment tool.

## Calculation Example

Consider a company ABC with the following data for the fiscal year:

- NOPAT: \$5,000,000
- WACC: 10%
- CE ([Capital Employed](../c/capital_employed.md)): \$40,000,000

Using the formula for WAI, we can calculate:

\[ \text{WAI} = \$5,000,000 - (0.10 \times \$40,000,000) \]
\[ \text{WAI} = \$5,000,000 - \$4,000,000 \]
\[ \text{WAI} = \$1,000,000 \]

Here, the [Wealth](../w/wealth.md) Added [Index](../i/index.md) is \$1,000,000. This outcome indicates that the company has created a [wealth](../w/wealth.md) of \$1,000,000 for its shareholders beyond the expected returns.

## Relationship With Other Financial Metrics

### Economic Value Added (EVA)

WAI is conceptually similar to another performance measure known as [Economic Value](../e/economic_value.md) Added (EVA), which is also used to gauge the true economic [profit](../p/profit.md) of a company. The primary difference lies in the subtle variations in the method of calculation and the [scope](../s/scope.md) of adjustments for [accounting](../a/accounting.md) distortions. Essentially, both measures aim to reflect the [surplus](../s/surplus.md) [value](../v/value.md) created above the [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md), thereby driving the management towards [value](../v/value.md)-creating activities.

### Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) and WACC

WAI integrates the assessment of ROIC and WACC. ROIC measures the [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) with which a company generates profits from its [capital](../c/capital.md), while WACC represents the minimum [return](../r/return.md) expected by investors. By evaluating both in a unified measure like WAI, stakeholders get a balanced view of the company's [operational efficiency](../o/operational_efficiency_in_trading.md) and [capital](../c/capital.md) cost management.

### Market Value Added (MVA)

[Market Value](../m/market_value.md) Added (MVA) is another related metric, which focuses on the [market](../m/market.md)’s perception of [value](../v/value.md) created by the company over time. MVA is the difference between the company's [market value](../m/market_value.md) and the [capital](../c/capital.md) contributed by investors. WAI, on the other hand, emphasizes the internal [value](../v/value.md) creation measured through operational performance and [capital](../c/capital.md) costs.

## Limitations

While WAI offers a [robust](../r/robust.md) measure of [shareholder value](../s/shareholder_value.md) creation, it is not without limitations:

- **Complexity**: Calculating WAI requires detailed financial data and sometimes complex adjustments, which can be cumbersome for smaller firms or those with less sophisticated financial reporting mechanisms.
  
- **Short-Term Focus**: Emphasizing WAI may lead management to focus too much on short-term profitability at the [expense](../e/expense.md) of long-term growth and sustainability.

- **Subjectivity in [Capital](../c/capital.md) Cost**: The calculation of WACC involves subjective inputs such as the [risk premium](../r/risk_premium.md) or [beta](../b/beta.md), which can lead to variations and potentially erroneous conclusions.

## Applications in Investor Decisions

Investors use WAI in [multiple](../m/multiple.md) ways to inform their decision-making process:

1. **Assessing Management Performance**: Investors can gauge whether the management team is adding [value](../v/value.md) over the resources deployed, aiding in the decision to maintain or adjust their positions in the company.

2. **Screening Investments**: Investors can use WAI as a screening tool to identify firms that consistently generate positive [value](../v/value.md), potentially forming a [basis](../b/basis.md) for investment selection.

3. **Evaluating [Acquisition](../a/acquisition.md) Targets**: In mergers and acquisitions, WAI helps in evaluating whether the target company is likely to contribute positively to the acquirer's [value](../v/value.md).

4. **Benchmarking**: Investors can compare WAI across [industry](../i/industry.md) peers, gaining insights into which companies are more efficient in [value](../v/value.md) creation relative to others.

## Conclusion

The [Wealth](../w/wealth.md) Added [Index](../i/index.md) is a powerful tool for evaluating the true economic [profit](../p/profit.md) generated by a company. By factoring in both operational profits and the [cost of capital](../c/cost_of_capital.md), WAI provides a transparent measure of [value](../v/value.md) addition to shareholders. However, its complexity and the potential for short-termism highlight the importance of a balanced approach when utilizing WAI in performance measurement and investment decisions. For investors and managers seeking to drive and assess long-term [value](../v/value.md), WAI offers an integrated metric that aligns [financial performance](../f/financial_performance.md) with [capital](../c/capital.md) [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md).

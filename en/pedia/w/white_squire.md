# White Squire

In the labyrinthine world of [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md) and investment strategies, a "White Squire" holds a distinct and intriguing position. The concept of a White Squire is particularly relevant in situations where companies face [hostile takeover](../h/hostile_takeover.md) attempts and need a strategic ally for defense. Understanding the nature, roles, and implications of a White Squire can elucidate some of the more complex maneuvers in corporate strategy and governance.

## Definition and Overview

A White Squire is an [investor](../i/investor.md) or a friendly [firm](../f/firm.md) that purchases a substantial, yet non-controlling, stake in a company, typically at the behest of the target company's management. This investment is substantial enough to deter [hostile takeover](../h/hostile_takeover.md) attempts without granting control over the company to the White Squire. Essentially, a White Squire acts as a defender or protector, helping prevent unwanted [takeover](../t/takeover.md) bids or hostile actions from activist investors.

---

* Example: In the years past, companies such as Warren Buffet's [Berkshire Hathaway](../b/berkshire_hathaway.md) have played the role of White Squire, stepping in to buy minority stakes in companies facing potential hostile takeovers. This move acts as a signal to the [market](../m/market.md) and other potential suitors that the existing management has influential allies supporting its stance.

## Characteristics of a White Squire

### Non-Controlling Stake

One of the defining characteristics of a White Squire is that their stake is deliberately kept substantial but non-controlling. This means the White Squire [will](../w/will.md) usually own a significant portion, such as 10-20% of the company, but not enough to [exercise](../e/exercise.md) unilateral control over company decisions. This is crucial as it reassures the target company's existing shareholders and management that they won't lose control, while still providing sufficient deterrence against hostile bidders.

### Strategic Ally

A White Squire typically has a strategic or long-term [interest](../i/interest.md) aligned with the target company. This could [range](../r/range.md) from shared [business](../b/business.md) interests, [industry](../i/industry.md) ties, or a similar vision for the company’s future. The relationship is symbiotic: the White Squire provides financial and strategic support, while potentially gaining influence and investment opportunities within a mutually beneficial arrangement.

---

* Example: The relationship between banks and fintech companies often involves strategic alliances. A large financial institution might take a substantial minority stake in an up-and-coming fintech company to foster innovation while preventing the fintech [firm](../f/firm.md) from being acquired by a competitor.

### Temporary or Long-Term Association

The engagement of a White Squire may be temporary, used explicitly to thwart an immediate hostile threat, or it might be envisioned as a long-term partnership. The [duration](../d/duration.md) of this alliance depends on the strategic needs and agreements between the involved parties.

## Mechanism and Application of a White Squire

### Hostile Takeover Defense

A White Squire is most commonly used as a defensive mechanism against hostile takeovers. In a [hostile bid](../h/hostile_bid.md), an acquiring company attempts to take control of the target company against the wishes of its management and board of directors. By bringing in a White Squire, the target company dilutes the influence of the hostile bidder, as the White Squire’s significant stake reduces the bidder's chances of accumulating enough [shares](../s/shares.md) to [gain](../g/gain.md) control.

### Shareholder Rights Plans (Poison Pills)

Sometimes, the White Squire might work in tandem with a [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) rights plan, commonly known as a "[poison pill](../p/poison_pill.md)." This is a strategy used by companies to make them less attractive to potential acquirers, often by diluting the [value](../v/value.md) of [shares](../s/shares.md) or increasing costs for the bidder. The presence of a White Squire adds another layer of defense, making it less likely that a hostile suitor can succeed without facing significant resistance.

### Potential Downsides

While the presence of a White Squire can safeguard a company against hostile takeovers, it may also introduce potential drawbacks. For instance:

- **Perception of Cronyism:** Existing shareholders might perceive the White Squire arrangement as favoritism, worried more about protecting existing management than maximizing [shareholder value](../s/shareholder_value.md).
- **Stake [Dilution](../d/dilution.md):** Bringing in a White Squire means issuing new [shares](../s/shares.md) or transferring a significant portion of existing [shares](../s/shares.md), which can dilute the stakes of other shareholders.
- **Conflicting Interests:** Although the White Squire is an ally, differences in strategic vision or [business](../b/business.md) objectives could arise over time, potentially leading to conflicts.

## Case Studies and Real-World Examples

### Berkshire Hathaway's Role as a White Squire

Warren Buffet's [Berkshire Hathaway](../b/berkshire_hathaway.md) has often been cited as an archetypical example of a White Squire. [Berkshire Hathaway](../b/berkshire_hathaway.md)'s significant yet non-controlling investments in various companies have acted as shields against unwanted [takeover](../t/takeover.md) attempts. An example includes its involvement with companies such as Occidental [Petroleum](../p/petroleum.md), where Berkshire helped stabilize the company’s [shareholder](../s/shareholder.md) base during periods of vulnerability.

### Technology Sector Alliances

In the [technology sector](../t/technology_sector.md), large firms often engage in minority stakes of promising startups not just for the sake of investment returns, but also as a strategic move to fortify against potential takeouts by competitors. A large tech company like Google or Amazon [investing](../i/investing.md) in a promising AI start-up is an example of this strategy. They thereby align themselves as staunch allies and protect the [firm](../f/firm.md) from hostile bids while fostering technological innovations that can be beneficial in the [long run](../l/long_run.md).

### Private Equity and Fintech

In the fintech world, [private equity](../p/private_equity.md) firms often act as White Squires. For instance, when a fintech start-up with a revolutionary product faces the threat of being acquired by a large, possibly hostile, competitor, a [private equity](../p/private_equity.md) [firm](../f/firm.md) might step in. They provide the necessary [capital](../c/capital.md) and strategic backing to thwart the [takeover](../t/takeover.md) while helping the fintech [firm](../f/firm.md) scale its operations, enter new markets, and solidify existing [business models](../b/business_models.md).

## Legal and Regulatory Considerations

### Compliance and Disclosure

The involvement of a White Squire is subject to various legal and regulatory frameworks, particularly involving compliance and [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) [obligations](../o/obligation.md). Any entity taking a significant stake in a publicly traded company must comply with SEC regulations or equivalent bodies depending on jurisdiction. Full [disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) of the nature, purpose, and extent of the investment typically needs to be made.

### Antitrust Laws

The formation of a White Squire arrangement must be carefully examined under [antitrust](../a/antitrust.md) laws to ensure it does not create monopolistic outcomes or unlawfully restrain [trade](../t/trade.md). Any large-scale [equity](../e/equity.md) stake that could potentially influence a [market](../m/market.md)'s competitive landscape may trigger scrutiny from regulatory authorities.

## Conclusion

The concept of a White Squire is a fascinating aspect of [corporate finance](../c/corporate_finance.md), demonstrating the intricate and strategic maneuvers companies deploy to protect their interests. By understanding and effectively leveraging relationships with White Squires, companies can safeguard against hostile takeovers, align with strategic partners, and navigate the complex landscapes of modern [corporate governance](../c/corporate_governance.md).

## Definition and Scope

[Workers' Compensation](../w/workers'_compensation.md) Coverage A refers to the primary [insurance](../i/insurance.md) cover provided under [workers' compensation](../w/workers'_compensation.md) policies. It guarantees that employees receive compensation for medical expenses, lost wages, and rehabilitation costs arising from work-related injuries or illnesses. Coverage A is mandated by state laws and varies in terms of requirements and benefits across different states.

Wage replacement benefits often come in several categories:

- Temporary Total Disability (TTD)

## Eligibility and Filing a Claim

### Eligibility Criteria

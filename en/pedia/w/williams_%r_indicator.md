# Williams %R Indicator

The [Williams %R](../w/williams_%r.md) [Indicator](../i/indicator.md), also known as [Williams Percent Range](../w/williams_percent_range.md) or simply %R, is a [momentum](../m/momentum.md) [indicator](../i/indicator.md) that measures [overbought](../o/overbought.md) and [oversold](../o/oversold.md) levels in a financial [market](../m/market.md). It was developed by the famous [technical analyst](../t/technical_analyst.md) Larry Williams. The [indicator](../i/indicator.md) oscillates between 0 and -100 and is designed to identify potential [reversal](../r/reversal.md) points, helping traders to make buy and sell decisions. Here is an extensive examination of the [Williams %R](../w/williams_%r.md) [Indicator](../i/indicator.md):

### Definition and Calculation
The [Williams %R](../w/williams_%r.md) [Indicator](../i/indicator.md) is calculated using the following formula:

\[ \%R = \frac{(Highest High - Close)}{(Highest High - Lowest Low)} \times -100 \]

Where:
- **Highest High** is the highest price over a specified period.
- **Lowest Low** is the lowest price over a specified period.
- **Close** is the most recent closing price.

The calculation produces a [value](../v/value.md) that is constrained between 0 and -100, where:
- A [value](../v/value.md) near -100 indicates that the [asset](../a/asset.md) is trading near its lowest price in the set period.
- A [value](../v/value.md) near 0 indicates that the [asset](../a/asset.md) is trading near its highest price in the set period.

### Interpretation
The primary use of the [Williams %R](../w/williams_%r.md) [Indicator](../i/indicator.md) is to detect [overbought](../o/overbought.md) and [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions in a [market](../m/market.md):
- **[Overbought](../o/overbought.md) Condition (0 to -20)**: When the %R [value](../v/value.md) is between 0 and -20, it suggests that the [market](../m/market.md) is [overbought](../o/overbought.md) and may be due for a [correction](../c/correction.md) or a [pullback](../p/pullback.md). Traders often look for sell opportunities in this [range](../r/range.md).
- **[Oversold](../o/oversold.md) Condition (-80 to -100)**: When the %R [value](../v/value.md) falls between -80 and -100, it indicates that the [market](../m/market.md) is [oversold](../o/oversold.md) and may be due for a bounce or surge. This is often seen as a buying opportunity.

### Practical Applications
#### 1. Identifying Trend Reversals
The [Williams %R](../w/williams_%r.md) is adept at identifying potential reversals. For instance, if the [indicator](../i/indicator.md) shows a prolonged period of [overbought](../o/overbought.md) conditions followed by a move below the [overbought](../o/overbought.md) threshold, it may signal a [trend](../t/trend.md) change from bullish to bearish.

#### 2. Divergence
[Divergence](../d/divergence.md) between the %R [indicator](../i/indicator.md) and [price action](../p/price_action.md) can also provide strong [trading signals](../t/trading_signals.md). For example:
- **[Bullish Divergence](../b/bullish_divergence.md)**: Price makes a lower low while %R makes a higher low.
- **[Bearish Divergence](../b/bearish_divergence.md)**: Price makes a higher high while %R makes a lower high.

#### 3. Confirming Trends
While primarily used for spotting reversals, the %R [indicator](../i/indicator.md) can also confirm the strength of existing trends. For instance, a strong [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md) may be validated if the [indicator](../i/indicator.md) spends considerable time in [overbought](../o/overbought.md) territory without significant corrections.

### Using Williams %R With Other Indicators
To enhance its effectiveness, traders often use the [Williams %R](../w/williams_%r.md) [Indicator](../i/indicator.md) in conjunction with other indicators. Some common pairings include:
- **Moving Averages**: Using moving averages to gauge [trend](../t/trend.md) direction while employing the %R for [overbought](../o/overbought.md) or [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions.
- **[Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index.md) (RSI)**: Combining %R with RSI can provide stronger confirmation of [market](../m/market.md) conditions.
- **MACD (Moving Average Convergence [Divergence](../d/divergence.md))**: Pairing %R with MACD can aid in identifying entry and exit points more accurately.

### Example
Consider an example where a 14-day [Williams %R](../w/williams_%r.md) is applied to a daily stock chart. Suppose the stock's highest high over the last 14 days is $50, the lowest low is $40, and the most recent close is $48:

\[ \%R = \frac{(50 - 48)}{(50 - 40)} \times -100 = \frac{2}{10} \times -100 = -20 \]

In this case, a %R [value](../v/value.md) of -20 indicates that the stock is in the [overbought](../o/overbought.md) zone, suggesting a potential [correction](../c/correction.md).

### Advantages
- **Simplicity**: The calculation and interpretation of the [Williams %R](../w/williams_%r.md) are straightforward.
- **Flexibility**: It can be applied to various markets and timeframes.
- **Effectiveness**: It has a proven track record in identifying [overbought](../o/overbought.md) and [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions.

### Limitations
- **[False Signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md)**: Like any technical [indicator](../i/indicator.md), it is prone to [false signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md), particularly in volatile markets.
- **Lag**: It may lag [price action](../p/price_action.md), leading to delayed signals.
- **Should be used with other indicators**: Relying solely on the [Williams %R](../w/williams_%r.md) can be risky; combining it with other indicators is recommended.

### Conclusion
The [Williams %R](../w/williams_%r.md) [Indicator](../i/indicator.md) is an invaluable tool for traders looking to identify [overbought](../o/overbought.md) and [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions in various markets. Its ability to pinpoint potential reversals and confirm trends makes it a popular choice among technical analysts. However, traders should be mindful of its limitations and consider using it in conjunction with other analytical tools for more accurate and reliable trading decisions.

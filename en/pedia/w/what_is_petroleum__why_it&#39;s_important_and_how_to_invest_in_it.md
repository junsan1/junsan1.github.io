# What Is Petroleum? Why It's Important and How To Invest in It

Petroleum, also known as crude oil, is a naturally occurring, yellow-to-black liquid found in geological formations beneath the Earth's surface. It is commonly refined into various types of fuels and is a significant raw material for many chemical products, including pharmaceuticals, solvents, fertilizers, pesticides, and plastics. This versatile substance is of immense importance because it fuels the global economy, serving as the primary source of energy for transportation, heating, and electricity generation.

## What Is Petroleum?

Petroleum is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons and other organic compounds. It forms from the remains of ancient marine organisms that settled in the sediment of prehistoric seas. Over millions of years, heat and pressure converted these remains into crude oil and natural gas. The composition of petroleum can vary significantly depending on its source, but it typically contains large amounts of carbon and hydrogen, along with trace elements such as sulfur, nitrogen, and oxygen.

### The Formation Process

The formation of petroleum is a lengthy process that begins with the accumulation of organic materials in sedimentary basins. Over millions of years, these materials are buried under layers of sediment. The increasing pressure and temperature initiate chemical reactions that transform the organic matter into hydrocarbons. Eventually, these hydrocarbons migrate through porous rock formations until they are trapped by impermeable rocks, forming an oil reservoir.

### Types of Petroleum

Petroleum can be classified into several types based on its composition and characteristics:

1. **Light Crude Oil:** High-quality oil with low density and high API gravity, easy to refine into gasoline and other high-value products.
2. **Medium Crude Oil:** Moderate density and API gravity, requiring more refining than light crude.
3. **Heavy Crude Oil:** High density and low API gravity, contains more impurities, and is challenging to refine.
4. **Bitumen:** Very heavy and viscous form of petroleum found in natural tar sands, requiring extensive processing to convert into usable products.

# William J. O'Neil

William J. O'Neil, born on March 25, 1933, is an American [entrepreneur](../e/entrepreneur.md), [stockbroker](../s/stockbroker.md), and author, best known for founding the stock brokerage and financial research [firm](../f/firm.md), William O'Neil & Co. Incorporated, and for developing the CAN SLIM [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md). Over several decades, O'Neil has significantly influenced retail and institutional [investing](../i/investing.md), particularly through his publications and educational efforts.

## Early Life and Education

O'Neil was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. He pursued his higher education at Southern Methodist University, where he earned a Bachelor of [Business](../b/business.md) Administration (B.B.A.) degree in 1955. With an early [interest](../i/interest.md) in [finance](../f/finance.md) and [investing](../i/investing.md), his educational background laid a [firm](../f/firm.md) foundation for his future career.

## The Genesis of William O'Neil & Co.

After a stint in the United States Air Force, O'Neil started his career as a [stockbroker](../s/stockbroker.md) with Hayden, Stone & Co. Noticing inefficiencies in how [stock market](../s/stock_market.md) data was collected and analyzed, he was inspired to start his own company. In 1963, he founded William O'Neil & Co. Incorporated, an investment research [firm](../f/firm.md) that provided institutional investors with extensive [stock market](../s/stock_market.md) data and analysis.

## Creation of CAN SLIM

One of O'Neil's most significant contributions to [investing](../i/investing.md) is the development of the CAN SLIM [investment strategy](../i/investment_strategy.md). This [growth stock](../g/growth_stock.md) [investing](../i/investing.md) strategy is based on the study of the best-performing [stocks](../s/stock.md) over the past 50 years. The acronym CAN SLIM stands for:

- **C**: Current quarterly [earnings](../e/earnings.md) per share (EPS)
- **A**: Annual [earnings](../e/earnings.md) growth
- **N**: New products, services, or management; New highs
- **S**: [Supply](../s/supply.md) and [demand](../d/demand.md)
- **L**: Leader or [laggard](../l/laggard.md)
- **I**: Institutional sponsorship
- **M**: [Market](../m/market.md) direction

### C: Current Quarterly Earnings

The "C" in CAN SLIM stands for Current Quarterly [Earnings](../e/earnings.md). O'Neil emphasized that investors should focus on companies that have shown a significant increase in their quarterly [earnings](../e/earnings.md) per share (EPS) compared to the same quarter in the prior year. Typically, an acceptable [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) is an EPS growth of at least 25%, although higher percentages are preferred.

### A: Annual Earnings Growth

The "A" stands for Annual [Earnings](../e/earnings.md) Growth. In O'Neil's analysis, companies that have demonstrated considerable annual [earnings](../e/earnings.md) growth over the past three to five years are more likely to continue growing. A growth rate of at least 25% per year is generally considered a good [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md).

### N: New Products, Services, Management, or Highs

The "N" stands for New things. Whether itâ€™s a new product or service, a new and innovative management team, or even a stock hitting new highs, companies that are breaking new ground often continue to [outperform](../o/outperform.md).

### S: Supply and Demand

The "S" in CAN SLIM stands for [Supply](../s/supply.md) and [Demand](../d/demand.md). O'Neil observed that the laws of [supply](../s/supply.md) and [demand](../d/demand.md) could also be applied to [stocks](../s/stock.md). When fewer [shares](../s/shares.md) are available (low [supply](../s/supply.md)) and many people want to buy them (high [demand](../d/demand.md)), the stock price tends to go up.

### L: Leader or Laggard

The "L" stands for Leader or [Laggard](../l/laggard.md). This criterion involves choosing the leading [stocks](../s/stock.md) within leading industries. Leaders often have stronger [earnings](../e/earnings.md) growth, superior products or services, and more substantial [market](../m/market.md) positions.

### I: Institutional Sponsorship

The "I" stands for Institutional Sponsorship. Institutional investors like mutual funds, pension funds, and [insurance](../i/insurance.md) companies often influence stock prices due to their large trading volumes. [Stocks](../s/stock.md) with strong institutional support tend to perform well.

### M: Market Direction

Lastly, the "M" stands for [Market](../m/market.md) Direction. Even the best [stocks](../s/stock.md) can falter in a [bear market](../b/bear_market.md). Therefore, understanding the overall [market](../m/market.md) [trend](../t/trend.md) is crucial for timing investments.

## Influence Through Publications

O'Neil is also a prolific author. His most famous book, *"How to Make [Money](../m/money.md) in [Stocks](../s/stock.md)"*, first published in 1988, has sold millions of copies worldwide and is considered an [investing](../i/investing.md) classic. The book elaborates on the CAN SLIM strategy and provides insights into O'Neil's [market](../m/market.md) philosophy, which combines both technical and [fundamental analysis](../f/fundamental_analysis.md).

He is the founder of the financial newspaper, *[Investor](../i/investor.md)'s [Business](../b/business.md) Daily* (IBD), first published in 1984. This publication aimed to compete with the *[Wall Street](../w/wall_street.md) [Journal](../j/journal.md)* and other financial dailies by providing actionable [stock analysis](../s/stock_analysis.md), data, and [market](../m/market.md) insights tailored to individual investors.

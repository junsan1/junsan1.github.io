# Rise and Fall

Enron Corporation was an American energy, commodities, and services company based in Houston, Texas. It was founded by Kenneth Lay in 1985 as a merger between Lay's Houston Natural Gas and another company named InterNorth. Before its scandalous fall in 2001, Enron was one of the world's major electricity, natural gas, communications, and pulp and paper companies, claiming revenues of nearly $101 billion in 2000.

## The Business Model and Success
### Energy Trading and Services
Enron started off as a pipeline company but quickly expanded its business model to become an energy trader and supplier. The company's innovative trading practices in the energy market allowed it to buy and sell natural gas and electricity, earning it substantial profit margins.

### Broadband Services
In addition to its energy trading operations, Enron also ventured into the broadband market, aiming to become a provider of high-speed internet services. This diversification was part of Enron’s strategy to brand itself as not just an energy company but also a comprehensive services provider.

### International Expansion
Enron's influence and business operations extended globally, with investments and ventures in countries like India, Brazil, and the United Kingdom. These international endeavors were aimed at replicating their U.S. success in emerging markets.

## The Scandal
### Financial Irregularities
Enron's downfall can be attributed primarily to its complex and fraudulent accounting practices. The company used special-purpose entities (SPEs) to hide its debt and inflate profitability. These accounting mechanisms allowed Enron to keep a significant amount of debt off its balance sheet, thereby presenting a false image of its financial health to investors and regulators.

### Role of Arthur Andersen
Arthur Andersen, one of the "Big Five" accounting firms at the time, was Enron's auditor. Andersen failed to expose Enron's fraudulent activities and instead certified its financial statements. This lapse in auditing integrity significantly contributed to the perpetuation of Enron's financial deceit.

### The Fall
The scandal broke publicly in October 2001 when Enron announced it was restating its earnings from 1997 to 2000. By December, Enron filed for bankruptcy—the largest in U.S. history at the time—with an estimated $63.4 billion in assets. Thousands of employees lost their jobs, and investors lost billions of dollars.

## Key Players and Their Roles
### Kenneth Lay
As the founder and CEO, Kenneth Lay was the face of Enron. Lay's managerial strategies laid the groundwork for Enron's initial success and later its catastrophic failure. He was found guilty of multiple counts of securities fraud but died of a heart attack before serving time.

### Jeffrey Skilling
Jeffrey Skilling, the COO and later CEO, was seen as the architect of Enron’s aggressive trading model. Skilling resigned unexpectedly in August 2001, just months before the company filed for bankruptcy. He was convicted on charges of insider trading, securities fraud, and making false statements.

### Andrew Fastow
As Enron's Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Fastow was the key figure behind the creation and management of the special-purpose entities that hid Enron’s debt. Fastow was indicted on 78 counts, including fraud, money laundering, and conspiracy, and was sentenced to six years in prison.

## Impact and Aftermath
### Legislative Changes
The Enron scandal resulted in the creation of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, aimed at improving corporate governance and restoring investor confidence. The act introduced stringent reforms to improve financial disclosures from corporations and prevent accounting fraud.

### Collapse of Arthur Andersen
Arthur Andersen's role in the Enron scandal led to its downfall. The firm was found guilty of obstructing justice for shredding Enron-related documents and lost its reputation, eventually leading to its dissolution.

### Public and Investor Sentiment
The Enron scandal shook public confidence in corporate governance and auditing practices. Investors became more skeptical, leading to increased scrutiny of corporate financial practices.

## Conclusion
Enron serves as a seminal example of corporate fraud and misgovernance. Its journey from a successful energy giant to a symbol of corporate malfeasance provides valuable lessons in ethics, corporate governance, and regulatory oversight. The scandal prompted significant changes in accounting regulations and corporate governance, aiming to prevent such occurrences in the future.

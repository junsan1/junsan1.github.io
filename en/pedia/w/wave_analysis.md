# Wave Analysis

Wave Analysis, often referred to in technical trading circles as [Elliott Wave Theory](../e/elliott_wave_theory.md), is a method for predicting [market cycles](../m/market_cycles.md) and trends by identifying repetitive [wave patterns](../w/wave_patterns_in_trading.md). This theory was developed by Ralph Nelson Elliott in the 1930s, and since then, it has become an essential tool for many traders, particularly those engaged in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md).

### Concept of Wave Analysis

Wave Analysis is predicated on the belief that financial markets move in a series of recognizable, repetitive cycles, driven by collective investor psychology or sentiment. These cycles are reflected in the [wave patterns](../w/wave_patterns_in_trading.md) visible on market charts. Elliott posited that market movements are the result of a natural rhythm of crowd behavior and are therefore predictable.

### Elliott Wave Theory

[Elliott Wave Theory](../e/elliott_wave_theory.md) divides market price movements into predictable [wave patterns](../w/wave_patterns_in_trading.md), which are broken down into two categories: impulse waves and corrective waves.

#### Impulse Waves

Impulse waves are the dominant waves that trend in the direction of the larger trend. According to Elliott, an impulse wave is composed of five smaller waves that move in the direction of the trend:
1. **Wave 1**: The initial move upwards.
2. **Wave 2**: A retracement of the initial move.
3. **Wave 3**: Usually the longest and strongest wave in the trend. It extends beyond the endpoint of Wave 1.
4. **Wave 4**: Another retracement, but typically not as deep as Wave 2.
5. **Wave 5**: The final leg in the direction of the trend, which often creates new highs.

#### Corrective Waves

Corrective waves are the counter to impulse waves and are movements against the trend. These are usually composed of three smaller waves and are labeled as A, B, and C:
1. **Wave A**: The first sell-off phase after the completion of the impulse waves.
2. **Wave B**: A movement counter to Wave A, typically correcting part of the decline.
3. **Wave C**: The final move in the correction, usually breaking below the low of Wave A.

### Wave Degrees and Fractal Nature

One of the cornerstones of [Elliott Wave Theory](../e/elliott_wave_theory.md) is its fractal nature, meaning that [wave patterns](../w/wave_patterns_in_trading.md) exist at all degrees of trend. This means that each wave within a specific degree contains lesser waves of the same basic pattern. The hierarchy of waves ranges from the largest Supercycle waves taking decades to complete, to the smallest waves that form intraday.

### Application of Wave Analysis in Algorithmic Trading

The implementation of wave principles within [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) systems can offer significant advantages. Algorithms can be programmed to recognize wave structures in real-time, thus enabling traders to enter and exit trades at optimal points based on the identification of impulse and corrective waves.

#### Pattern Recognition Algorithms

[Pattern recognition](../p/pattern_recognition.md) is a critical aspect of wave analysis in [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). Algorithms can be trained using historical data to recognize the repetitive [wave patterns](../w/wave_patterns_in_trading.md). Machine learning techniques, including [neural networks](../n/neural_networks_in_trading.md) and deep learning, are often used for this purpose. These algorithms analyze massive amounts of historical market data to identify and predict future wave formations.

#### Risk Management Strategies

Wave analysis also supports robust [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) strategies. By understanding the wave structures, traders can set stop-loss and take-profit levels more effectively. For example, if a trader identifies that the market is within Wave 3 of an impulse wave, they might set their stop-loss below the low of Wave 2.

### Criticisms and Limitations

Despite its widespread usage, wave analysis is not without criticisms. Some experts argue that the theory is too subjective, with patterns often being identified only in hindsight. The complexity and varying interpretations of wave counts can lead to inconsistencies and different conclusions drawn by different analysts.

### Summary

Wave Analysis, particularly through the lens of [Elliott Wave Theory](../e/elliott_wave_theory.md), provides a robust framework for understanding market movements. It offers valuable insights for both discretionary and algorithmic traders, facilitating better prediction, entry and exit points, and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md). However, while powerful, it requires practice and a deep understanding to apply correctly, and its subjective nature can present challenges in consistency and objectivity.

# Whole Life Annuity Due

A **[Whole Life Annuity](../w/whole_life_annuity.md) Due** is a financial product that provides a series of payments made at regular intervals over the lifetime of an [annuitant](../a/annuitant.md), with each [payment](../p/payment.md) occurring at the beginning of each period. Unlike a standard [whole life annuity](../w/whole_life_annuity.md) where payments are made at the end of each period, an [annuity due](../a/annuity_due.md) ensures that the [annuitant](../a/annuitant.md) receives the periodic payments immediately, starting from the inception of the annuity contract.

## Understanding Whole Life Annuity Due

[Whole Life Annuity](../w/whole_life_annuity.md) Due involves an upfront [capital](../c/capital.md) outlay by the individual or [annuitant](../a/annuitant.md), which is invested by the [insurance](../i/insurance.md) company or financial institution. The objective is to provide stable, lifelong payments. Essentially, the [annuitant](../a/annuitant.md) trades a lump sum of [money](../m/money.md) today for a promise of regular payments that begin immediately and continue for the rest of their life. The payments are guaranteed regardless of how long the [annuitant](../a/annuitant.md) lives.

### Key Features

1. **Immediate Payments**: Payments start at the beginning of each period, typically monthly, quarterly, or annually.
2. **Lifetime Guarantee**: Payments continue for the lifetime of the [annuitant](../a/annuitant.md), providing a guaranteed [income](../i/income.md) stream.
3. **Fixed or Variable Payments**: The payments can either be fixed, remaining the same throughout the [annuitant](../a/annuitant.md)'s life, or variable, adjusting based on investment performance or [inflation](../i/inflation.md) indices.
4. **Mortality Assumptions**: Pricing and [payment](../p/payment.md) amounts are contingent upon actuarial [life expectancy](../l/life_expectancy.md) calculations.
5. **[Interest](../i/interest.md) Assumptions**: Payments are also influenced by projected [interest](../i/interest.md) rates over the [annuitant](../a/annuitant.md)'s lifetime.

## Calculation of Annuity Payments

Calculating the annuity payments for a [Whole Life Annuity](../w/whole_life_annuity.md) Due typically involves understanding actuarial [present value](../p/present_value.md) concepts. Given that payments start immediately, the formula differs slightly from a standard annuity. 

### Formula

The [present value](../p/present_value.md) of a [Whole Life Annuity](../w/whole_life_annuity.md) Due can be represented as:

\[ PV = P \cdot \left(\dfrac{1 - v^n}{d} + 1\right) \]

where:
- \(PV\) is the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of the annuity.
- \(P\) is the amount of each [payment](../p/payment.md).
- \(v\) is the [discount](../d/discount.md) [factor](../f/factor.md), \( v = \dfrac{1}{1 + i} \), where \(i\) is the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) per period.
- \(n\) is the number of periods.
- \(d\) is the actuarial [present value](../p/present_value.md) rate or the force of [interest](../i/interest.md).

### Example

Suppose an individual wants to purchase a [Whole Life Annuity](../w/whole_life_annuity.md) Due that pays $10,000 annually and the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) is 5%. To find the [present value](../p/present_value.md) of the annuity (how much they need to invest upfront), one would set up the calculation as described above.

Assuming the individual's [life expectancy](../l/life_expectancy.md) is 20 years, we first determine \(v = 1/(1 + 0.05) = 0.95238\), and then:
\[ PV = 10,000 \cdot \left(\dfrac{1 - (0.95238)^{20}}{0.05} + 1\right) \]

After calculating, this results in:
\[ PV = 10,000 \cdot \left(15.3725 + 1\right) \]
\[ PV = 10,000 \cdot 16.3725 \]
\[ PV = 163,725 \]

The individual would need to invest $163,725 upfront for the $10,000 annual payouts to commence immediately and continue for their lifetime.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

1. **Guaranteed [Income](../i/income.md)**: Provides a reliable stream of [income](../i/income.md) for life, removing the [uncertainty](../u/uncertainty_in_trading.md) of outliving one's savings.
2. **Financial [Security](../s/security.md)**: Offers peace of mind knowing that expenses can be covered, irrespective of longevity.
3. **Tax Benefits**: Depending on jurisdiction, there can be tax advantages associated with annuity payments.

### Disadvantages

1. **Irreversibility**: The initial [capital](../c/capital.md) is typically not retrievable, meaning the [annuitant](../a/annuitant.md) can't change their mind once the contract is active.
2. **[Inflation](../i/inflation.md) [Risk](../r/risk.md)**: Fixed payments may lose [purchasing power](../p/purchasing_power.md) over time due to [inflation](../i/inflation.md) unless the annuity includes an [inflation](../i/inflation.md) protection [rider](../r/rider.md).
3. **Lower Returns**: The returns of annuities may be lower compared to potential [market](../m/market.md) investments due to the conservative nature of the product.

## Use Cases in Financial Planning

[Whole Life Annuity](../w/whole_life_annuity.md) Dues are often used in [retirement planning](../r/retirement_planning.md), particularly for those looking to secure a steady [income](../i/income.md) that cannot be outlived. They are a favored choice for individuals averse to [risk](../r/risk.md) and uncertain [market](../m/market.md) conditions. 

### Who Should Consider This Annuity?

- **Retirees**: Those looking for a stable, predictable [income](../i/income.md) during retirement.
- **[Risk-Averse](../r/risk-averse.md) Individuals**: Those unwilling to take on investment [risk](../r/risk.md) and prefer guaranteed returns.
- **Dependents**: Used to secure [income](../i/income.md) for non-working spouses or dependents.

## Comparison with Other Annuity Types

[Whole Life Annuity](../w/whole_life_annuity.md) Due is just one type of annuity, and it's crucial to understand how it compares with other available [options](../o/options.md):

1. **Standard [Whole Life Annuity](../w/whole_life_annuity.md)**: Payments begin at the end of each period.
2. **Term Certain Annuity**: Payments are made for a fixed period rather than for the [annuitant](../a/annuitant.md)'s lifetime.
3. **[Deferred Annuity](../d/deferred_annuity.md)**: Payments begin at a future date, often after a period of accumulation.
4. **[Variable Annuity](../v/variable_annuity.md)**: Allows the [annuitant](../a/annuitant.md)'s payments to vary based on the performance of the investment [options](../o/options.md) chosen.

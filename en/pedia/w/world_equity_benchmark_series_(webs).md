# World Equity Benchmark Series (WEBS)

The World [Equity](../e/equity.md) [Benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) Series (WEBS) represents one of the pivotal innovations in the realm of global [exchange](../e/exchange.md)-traded funds (ETFs). Initiated in 1996 by Morgan Stanley, the WEBS were the first of their kind to provide investors diversified exposure to a wide array of global markets through a single [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md). These funds are now widely recognized under the name [iShares](../i/ishares.md) MSCI, as they were eventually taken under the banner of BlackRock's [iShares](../i/ishares.md) ETF suite. 

## Origin and Development

### Introduction to WEBS

In the mid-1990s, global [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md) were growing in complexity and interconnectedness. Institutional and retail investors alike were seeking efficient ways to diversify their portfolios internationally without the burdensome [logistics](../l/logistics.md) of managing [multiple](../m/multiple.md) foreign securities. Morgan Stanley [Capital](../c/capital.md) International (MSCI) and Barclays Global Investors (BGI), which later became part of BlackRock, collaborated to address this [market](../m/market.md) need. The result was the creation of the World [Equity](../e/equity.md) [Benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) Series (WEBS).

### Initial Concept and Listing

The first WEBS ETFs were [listed](../l/listed.md) on the American Stock [Exchange](../e/exchange.md) (AMEX) in 1996. These products were designed to track the performance of MSCI country indices, which are themselves comprehensive benchmarks for international investment performance. By purchasing [shares](../s/shares.md) in a WEBS ETF, investors could [gain](../g/gain.md) exposure to the equities of an entire country's [market](../m/market.md) rather than having to buy individual [stocks](../s/stock.md).

## Mechanics of WEBS

### Structuring of WEBS ETFs

WEBS ETFs are structured as [open](../o/open.md)-ended investment funds, meaning they can create new [shares](../s/shares.md) or redeem existing [shares](../s/shares.md) in response to [investor](../i/investor.md) [demand](../d/demand.md). This structure allows the ETFs to remain closely aligned with the [value](../v/value.md) of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) assets, as the [supply](../s/supply.md) of [shares](../s/shares.md) can be adjusted based on inflows and outflows. Each WEBS ETF holds a diversified portfolio of securities that replicate the performance of the respective MSCI [index](../i/index.md) it tracks.

### Diversification and Market Exposure

One significant advantage of WEBS ETFs is their built-in [diversification](../d/diversification.md). Each [fund](../f/fund.md)'s portfolio includes a wide [range](../r/range.md) of securities from the respective [market](../m/market.md) it represents. [Global diversification](../g/global_diversification.md) is also simplified, as investors can easily purchase [shares](../s/shares.md) in [multiple](../m/multiple.md) WEBS ETFs to achieve geographic [diversification](../d/diversification.md) without having to deal with [multiple](../m/multiple.md) accounts, currencies, or brokers.

### Accessibility and Liquidity

The [exchange](../e/exchange.md)-traded nature of WEBS ETFs provides significant benefits in terms of accessibility and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md). As these ETFs are [listed](../l/listed.md) on major stock exchanges, they can be bought and sold throughout the trading day at [market](../m/market.md) prices. This flexibility contrasts with mutual funds, which can only be traded at the end of the trading day at the net [asset](../a/asset.md) [value](../v/value.md) (NAV).

## Performance and Fees

### Tracking Accuracy

One of the critical metrics for evaluating an ETF is its tracking accuracy. WEBS ETFs are designed to replicate the performance of their respective MSCI indices as closely as possible. Various factors, such as tracking errors, [market](../m/market.md) impact, and [currency](../c/currency.md) fluctuations, can influence the degree to which an ETF follows its [benchmark](../b/benchmark.md). Generally, WEBS ETFs have exhibited a high degree of tracking accuracy due to their replication methodology.

### Cost Efficiency

[Expense](../e/expense.md) ratios are another crucial consideration for investors. WEBS ETFs are known for their cost [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md), with relatively low [expense](../e/expense.md) ratios compared to actively managed funds. This low-cost structure makes them an attractive option for long-term investors seeking international exposure.

### Dividend Distribution

WEBS ETFs typically distribute dividends to shareholders, which are derived from the [dividend](../d/dividend.md) payments of the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) securities in the [fund](../f/fund.md). The [yield](../y/yield.md) can vary significantly across different WEBS, reflecting the [dividend](../d/dividend.md) policies and [economic conditions](../e/economic_conditions.md) of the respective markets. These dividends can be reinvested or taken as [income](../i/income.md).

## Strategic Use in Portfolios

### Core Portfolio Holding

Owing to their broad-based exposure, WEBS ETFs are commonly used as core [holdings](../h/holdings.md) in globally diversified portfolios. Investors seeking to reduce country-specific [risk](../r/risk.md) and benefit from growth opportunities in various regions may allocate a portion of their portfolio to [multiple](../m/multiple.md) WEBS ETFs, thereby achieving a balanced international [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md).

### Tactical Allocation

Beyond serving as core [holdings](../h/holdings.md), WEBS ETFs are also used for tactical [asset allocation](../a/asset_allocation.md). Investors might [overweight](../o/overweight.md) or [underweight](../u/underweight.md) specific countries or regions based on their economic outlook, political developments, or [market](../m/market.md) valuations. WEBS ETFs provide the flexibility to make these adjustments easily and efficiently.

### Hedging and Risk Management

The [liquid](../l/liquid.md) nature of WEBS ETFs also makes them suitable instruments for hedging and [risk management](../r/risk_management.md). For instance, an [investor](../i/investor.md) concerned about potential declines in a specific [market](../m/market.md) could short-sell the respective WEBS ETF to protect against losses. Similarly, [options](../o/options.md) and other [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md) on these ETFs can be used for more sophisticated [hedging strategies](../h/hedging_strategies.md).

## Impact on Financial Markets

### Increased Participation in Global Markets

WEBS ETFs have democratized access to international markets, enabling a broader [range](../r/range.md) of investors, including retail investors, to participate in global growth opportunities. This increased participation has contributed to the integration and [liquidity](../l/liquidity.md) of global [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md).

### Price Discovery and Market Efficiency

By facilitating convenient and cost-effective access to international equities, WEBS ETFs have played a role in enhancing [price discovery](../p/price_discovery.md) and [market efficiency](../m/market_efficiency.md). The continuous trading of these ETFs helps reflect global economic developments in [market](../m/market.md) prices more rapidly and accurately.

### Encouragement of Index-Investment Approach

The popularity of WEBS ETFs has spurred the growth of the [index](../i/index.md)-investment approach. Investors have increasingly recognized the advantages of [passive investment strategies](../p/passive_investment_strategies.md), including lower fees, broad [diversification](../d/diversification.md), and [transparency](../t/transparency.md). As a result, the assets under management (AUM) in [index](../i/index.md)-tracking ETFs have grown substantially.

## Evolution and Rebranding

### Transition to iShares

In 2000, Barclays Global Investors acquired the rights to the WEBS [product line](../p/product_line.md) and rebranded them as [iShares](../i/ishares.md) MSCI [Index](../i/index.md) Funds. This rebranding was a part of a broader strategy to create a comprehensive suite of ETF products under the [iShares](../i/ishares.md) banner, which has since become one of the most prominent names in the ETF [industry](../i/industry.md). In 2009, BlackRock acquired Barclays Global Investors, bringing the [iShares](../i/ishares.md) brand under its management.

### Expansion of Product Offerings

Since their inception, the [range](../r/range.md) of WEBS (now [iShares](../i/ishares.md) MSCI) ETFs has expanded significantly. BlackRock has continued to launch new ETFs, [offering](../o/offering.md) exposure to a broader array of markets and sectors. This [expansion](../e/expansion.md) has allowed investors to tailor their portfolios with greater precision to meet their specific investment needs and preferences.

### Technological Advancements

Technological advancements in trading platforms, [data analytics](../d/data_analytics.md), and [market](../m/market.md) [infrastructure](../i/infrastructure.md) have further enhanced the functionality and attractiveness of WEBS ETFs. Investors can now access these funds more easily than ever before, using sophisticated tools to manage their investments and execute transactions quickly and efficiently.

## Conclusion

The World [Equity](../e/equity.md) [Benchmark](../b/benchmark.md) Series (WEBS) ETFs, now part of the [iShares](../i/ishares.md) MSCI line, have had a profound impact on the investment landscape. By providing efficient, low-cost, and diversified exposure to international markets, they have enabled a broader [range](../r/range.md) of investors to participate in global opportunities. The success and evolution of WEBS ETFs underscore the importance of innovation in the financial [industry](../i/industry.md), driving greater accessibility, [transparency](../t/transparency.md), and [efficiency](../e/efficiency.md) in global [investing](../i/investing.md).

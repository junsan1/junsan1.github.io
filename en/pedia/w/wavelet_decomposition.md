# Wavelet Decomposition

## Introduction

Wavelet decomposition is a mathematical tool used to analyze and represent signals in [multiple](../m/multiple.md) resolutions or scales. It has numerous applications in various fields such as [signal processing](../s/signal_processing_in_trading.md), image compression, and, notably, [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md). Wavelet decomposition can [handle](../h/handle.md) data that is non-stationary, making it highly suitable for [financial time series](../f/financial_time_series.md) that exhibit non-stationarity behaviors like stock prices, forex rates, and [commodity](../c/commodity.md) prices.

## Overview of Wavelet Decomposition

Wavelet decomposition involves breaking down a signal into a set of [basis](../b/basis.md) functions called wavelets. Unlike Fourier transform, which uses sine and cosine functions, wavelets are localized in both time and frequency domains. This allows wavelet decomposition to provide detailed information about signals across various time frames.

The process of wavelet decomposition includes:

1. **Selection of a Mother Wavelet**: This is the basic wavelet function from which other wavelets [will](../w/will.md) be derived through scaling and translation.
2. **Decomposition Levels**: The signal is decomposed into [multiple](../m/multiple.md) levels using the mother wavelet, each representing different frequency components of the original signal.
3. **Computing Approximation and Detail Coefficients**: At each level of decomposition, the signal is divided into approximation coefficients (representing low-frequency components) and detail coefficients (representing high-frequency components).

## Mathematical Foundation

The core idea of wavelet decomposition can be mathematically described using the dilation and translation of the mother wavelet Ïˆ(t):

\[ \psi_{a,b}(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \psi\left(\frac{t - b}{a}\right) \]

where \( a \) is the scaling parameter and \( b \) is the translation parameter.

The [wavelet transform](../w/wavelet_transform_in_trading.md) of a signal f(t) is defined as:

\[ \text{Wf}(a,b) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) \overline{\psi_{a,b}(t)} dt \]

where \( \overline{\psi_{a,b}(t)} \) is the complex conjugate of \( \psi_{a,b}(t) \).

## Steps in Wavelet Decomposition

### Step 1: Selecting a Mother Wavelet

Common wavelets used in financial applications include Haar, Daubechies, Coiflets, and Symlets. Each type of wavelet has a different shape and property that makes it suitable for specific types of analysis.

### Step 2: Performing Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)

The Discrete [Wavelet Transform](../w/wavelet_transform_in_trading.md) is applied to obtain the coefficients at various levels. This involves:

1. **Convolving the signal with the wavelet function** to obtain detail coefficients.
2. **Convolving the signal with the scaling function** to obtain approximation coefficients.

Mathematically:

\[ cA_{i+1}[n] = \sum_{k} h[k - 2n] cA_i[k] \]
\[ cD_{i+1}[n] = \sum_{k} g[k - 2n] cA_i[k] \]

where \( cA_i \) and \( cD_i \) represent the approximation and detail coefficients at level i, and h[k] and g[k] are low-pass and high-pass filter coefficients.

### Step 3: Iterative Decomposition

The approximation coefficients \( cA_i \) from one level are further decomposed into higher levels until the desired level of resolution is achieved. This multi-level decomposition helps in analyzing the signal at different frequencies and time intervals.

## Application in Algorithmic Trading

### Denoising Financial Data

Financial data often contains [noise](../n/noise.md) which can obscure the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) signal. Wavelet decomposition can be used for denoising by retaining only the significant approximation and detail coefficients while discarding [noise](../n/noise.md) components.

### Feature Extraction

In [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), extracting meaningful features from raw data is crucial. Wavelet coefficients can serve as features that represent different aspects of the [financial time series](../f/financial_time_series.md), such as trends, cycles, and abrupt changes.

### High-Frequency Trading

High-frequency [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) benefit from the multi-resolution analysis provided by wavelet decomposition. It enables traders to detect short-term patterns and anomalies that traditional methods may miss.

### Predictive Modeling

Wavelet-decomposed features can significantly improve the performance of [predictive models](../p/predictive_models_in_trading.md) like [neural networks](../n/neural_networks_in_trading.md) and [support vector machines](../s/support_vector_machines_in_trading.md) (SVMs). These models can better capture the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) dynamics of the [market](../m/market.md) when trained on wavelet-transformed data.

### Example: Application in Stock Market Prediction

A practical example involves predicting stock prices. By applying wavelet decomposition to historical stock price data, traders can identify the [underlying](../u/underlying.md) [trend](../t/trend.md) and predict future movements more accurately. Once the data is decomposed, only the significant detail coefficients are used for further analysis, removing the effects of [noise](../n/noise.md) and irrelevant fluctuations.

### Case Study: Wavelet-Based Algorithm in Forex Trading

In Forex trading, wavelet decomposition can be utilized to filter out [market](../m/market.md) [noise](../n/noise.md) and enhance predictive algorithms. Suppose a [trader](../t/trader.md) is working on the EUR/USD [currency](../c/currency.md) pair. By decomposing the [exchange rate](../e/exchange_rate.md) data using a wavelet method, the [trader](../t/trader.md) can identify cyclical patterns and [volatility](../v/volatility.md), which are then used to fine-tune [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md).

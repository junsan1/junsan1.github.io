# Wilder's RSI

Wilder's [Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index_instrument.md), commonly referred to as RSI, is a [momentum](../m/momentum.md) [oscillator](../o/oscillator.md) developed by J. Welles Wilder. It measures the speed and change of price movements and is primarily used in [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) of [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). Initially introduced in Wilder's 1978 book, "New Concepts in Technical [Trading Systems](../t/trading_systems.md)," the RSI has since become a fundamental tool for traders and analysts across various [asset](../a/asset.md) markets, including [stocks](../s/stock.md), commodities, and forex.

### Key Concepts of RSI

#### Calculation of RSI

RSI is calculated using the following formula:
\[ RSI = 100 - \frac{100}{1 + RS} \]
where RS ([Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md)) is the average [gain](../g/gain.md) of n days divided by the average loss of n days. Typically, n is 14 days by [default](../d/default.md), as suggested by Wilder. The Average [Gain](../g/gain.md) and Average Loss are calculated over a specified period and smoothed using a simple moving average.

\[ RS = \frac{\text{Average [Gain](../g/gain.md)}}{\text{Average Loss}} \]

#### Interpreting RSI Values

- **[Overbought](../o/overbought.md) and [Oversold](../o/oversold.md) Conditions**: RSI values [range](../r/range.md) from 0 to 100. Traditionally, an RSI above 70 indicates an [overbought](../o/overbought.md) condition, suggesting that the [asset](../a/asset.md) may be [overvalued](../o/overvalued.md) and potentially due for a price [correction](../c/correction.md) or [pullback](../p/pullback.md). Conversely, an RSI below 30 indicates an [oversold](../o/oversold.md) condition, suggesting that the [asset](../a/asset.md) may be [undervalued](../u/undervalued.md) and due for a price rebound.
  
- **Centerline Crossover**: An RSI level of 50 is considered the midpoint, and crossovers of this level can indicate potential changes in [market](../m/market.md) direction. When RSI moves above 50, it is often seen as a bullish signal, while a move below 50 can be viewed as bearish.
  
- **Divergences**: Divergences between the RSI and [price action](../p/price_action.md) can signal potential [reversal](../r/reversal.md) points. A [bullish divergence](../b/bullish_divergence.md) occurs when the price makes a new low, but the RSI forms a higher low, indicating weakening bearish [momentum](../m/momentum.md). Conversely, a [bearish divergence](../b/bearish_divergence.md) happens when the price makes a new high while the RSI forms a lower high, suggesting weakening bullish [momentum](../m/momentum.md).

### Practical Applications

#### Trend Identification
RSI is frequently used to identify [trend](../t/trend.md) strength and potential [reversal](../r/reversal.md) points. In strongly trending markets, RSI can remain in [overbought](../o/overbought.md) or [oversold](../o/oversold.md) territory for extended periods, indicating a sustained [trend](../t/trend.md). In [range](../r/range.md)-bound markets, RSI helps traders identify potential entry and exit points based on [overbought](../o/overbought.md) and [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions.

#### Combining with Other Indicators
RSI is often used in conjunction with other [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md) to enhance reliability. For example, combining RSI with moving averages, [Bollinger Bands](../b/bollinger_bands.md), or [Fibonacci retracement](../f/fibonacci_retracement.md) levels can provide more comprehensive [market](../m/market.md) analysis and better signal confirmation.

#### Example Trade Setup
Consider a stock that has been in a strong [uptrend](../u/uptrend.md) but shows signs of weakening [momentum](../m/momentum.md) with an RSI reading above 70. A [trader](../t/trader.md) might wait for the RSI to cross back below 70 as a signal to sell or reduce their position, anticipating a potential price [correction](../c/correction.md).

### Limitations and Considerations

While RSI is a powerful tool, it is not without limitations. [False signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md) can occur, especially in highly volatile markets. Additionally, relying solely on RSI can be risky; it is crucial to consider broader [market](../m/market.md) context, fundamental factors, and other [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md).

### Conclusion

Wilderâ€™s RSI remains a vital component of [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md), [offering](../o/offering.md) insights into [market](../m/market.md) [momentum](../m/momentum.md) and potential turning points. Its simplicity, ease of interpretation, and adaptability across different markets make it a valuable tool for traders and analysts.

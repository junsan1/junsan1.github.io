# Williams %R Oscillator

#### Introduction
The [Williams %R](../w/williams_%r.md) [oscillator](../o/oscillator.md), developed by famed [trader](../t/trader.md) Larry Williams, is a [momentum](../m/momentum.md)-based [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) [indicator](../i/indicator.md) that helps traders identify [overbought](../o/overbought.md) and [oversold](../o/oversold.md) [market](../m/market.md) conditions. Unlike other oscillators, such as the [Relative Strength](../r/relative_strength.md) [Index](../i/index.md) (RSI) and the [Stochastic Oscillator](../s/stochastic_oscillator.md), the [Williams %R](../w/williams_%r.md) operates on a negative scale and is primarily used to pinpoint [market](../m/market.md) turning points. It is highly regarded for its simplicity and effectiveness in a variety of trading scenarios.

#### Formula
The [Williams %R](../w/williams_%r.md) [oscillator](../o/oscillator.md) is calculated using the following formula:

```
%R = (Highest High - Close) / (Highest High - Lowest Low) * -100
```

Where:
- `Highest High` is the highest price of the [asset](../a/asset.md) over a specific period.
- `Lowest Low` is the lowest price of the [asset](../a/asset.md) over the same period.
- `Close` is the most recent closing price of the [asset](../a/asset.md).

Typically, the period considered is 14 days, but this can be adjusted based on [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) and preferences.

#### Interpretation

1. **[Overbought](../o/overbought.md) and [Oversold](../o/oversold.md) Levels**: The [Williams %R](../w/williams_%r.md) oscillates between 0 and -100. Values above -20 indicate that the [market](../m/market.md) is [overbought](../o/overbought.md), and values below -80 indicate that the [market](../m/market.md) is [oversold](../o/oversold.md).
2. **Buy and Sell Signals**:
   - **[Overbought](../o/overbought.md) Conditions**: When the %R reaches -20 or higher, it suggests that the [asset](../a/asset.md) might be [overbought](../o/overbought.md), and a price [correction](../c/correction.md) could be imminent. Traders might consider this an opportunity to sell or short the [asset](../a/asset.md).
   - **[Oversold](../o/oversold.md) Conditions**: When the %R falls to -80 or lower, it indicates that the [asset](../a/asset.md) is [oversold](../o/oversold.md), and a price bounce could be forthcoming. This might be seen as a potential buying opportunity.
3. **[Divergence](../d/divergence.md)**: When the price of an [asset](../a/asset.md) is making new highs or lows, but the [Williams %R](../w/williams_%r.md) is not, it can signal a potential [reversal](../r/reversal.md) in the [trend](../t/trend.md).

#### Practical Application

1. **[Trend](../t/trend.md) Confirmation**: The [Williams %R](../w/williams_%r.md) can confirm the direction of the [trend](../t/trend.md) when used in conjunction with other indicators. For example, if a moving average suggests a bullish [trend](../t/trend.md), and the [Williams %R](../w/williams_%r.md) exits the [oversold](../o/oversold.md) region, it could confirm the upward trajectory.
2. **Combination with Other Indicators**: The [Williams %R](../w/williams_%r.md) often works well when combined with other [technical indicators](../t/technical_indicators.md), such as moving averages, MACD, or the [Average Directional Index](../a/average_directional_index_(adx).md) (ADX), to increase the reliability of [trading signals](../t/trading_signals.md).
3. **[Swing Trading](../s/swing_trading.md)**: The [Williams %R](../w/williams_%r.md) is particularly useful for [swing trading](../s/swing_trading.md), where traders aim to capture short- to medium-term gains in a stock or any [financial instrument](../f/financial_instrument.md) over a period of a few days to several weeks.

#### Limitations

1. **[False Signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md)**: Like any other technical [indicator](../i/indicator.md), [Williams %R](../w/williams_%r.md) can produce [false signals](../f/false_signals_in_trading.md), particularly in choppy or sideways markets. Traders must [exercise](../e/exercise.md) caution and avoid relying solely on the [Williams %R](../w/williams_%r.md) for making trading decisions.
2. **[Lagging Indicator](../l/lagging_indicator.md)**: While the [Williams %R](../w/williams_%r.md) can provide timely signals, it is still a [lagging indicator](../l/lagging_indicator.md), meaning it is based on past price movements. This can sometimes lead to delayed signals that might not fully capture rapid [market](../m/market.md) changes.

#### Conclusion

The [Williams %R](../w/williams_%r.md) [oscillator](../o/oscillator.md) is a versatile and powerful tool for traders looking to identify [overbought](../o/overbought.md) and [oversold](../o/oversold.md) conditions in the [market](../m/market.md). While it is not without its limitations, when used judiciously in conjunction with other indicators and [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md), it can significantly enhance a [trader](../t/trader.md)'s ability to make informed decisions.

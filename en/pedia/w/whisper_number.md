# Whisper Number

In the [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), the term "whisper number" refers to the unofficial and unpublished [earnings](../e/earnings.md) forecasts, predictions, or expectations that are shared privately among analysts, traders, and investors. These whispers are often collated from a variety of informal sources, including [industry](../i/industry.md) insiders, subjective analysis, or through consensus in the trading community. Unlike the more widely distributed and regulated [Wall Street](../w/wall_street.md) [earnings estimates](../e/earnings_estimate.md), whisper numbers exist in a grey area where they can significantly influence stock prices and [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md) without any official acknowledgment.

## Origin and Concepts

Whisper numbers have their roots in the historical practices of [stock market](../s/stock_market.md) trading, where informal communication among insiders and experienced traders would often lead to better-than-public insight about company performance. Unlike official [earnings](../e/earnings.md) forecasts, which are usually published by major [financial analysis](../f/financial_analysis.md) firms and largely adhere to rigorous methodologies, whisper numbers are more speculative.

This speculative nature of whisper numbers means they capture the [market](../m/market.md)'s true sentiment and expectations, which often diverge from official consensus estimates. For example, a company's official [earnings](../e/earnings.md) estimate might be set by a group of highly cautious analysts, while the whisper number could be more optimistic based on recent insider knowledge or intangible factors not accounted for by the official forecast.

## Influence on the Market

Whisper numbers play a critical role in stock price movements, especially around [earnings](../e/earnings.md) season. When a company announces its [earnings](../e/earnings.md), the results are compared not only against the official expectations but also against the whisper number. If the actual [earnings](../e/earnings.md) match or exceed the whisper number, it often results in a positive stock price reaction. Conversely, if the [earnings](../e/earnings.md) fall short of the whisper number but beat the official forecast, the stock might still experience a negative reaction because traders' expectations were disappointed.

### Psychological Impact

Traders and investors often act on whisper numbers due to a psychological phenomenon known as "[anchoring](../a/anchoring.md)." [Anchoring](../a/anchoring.md) occurs when an individual relies too heavily on an initial piece of information (the anchor) to make subsequent decisions. In this case, whisper numbers serve as the anchor point, and they shape expectations and trading decisions. This behavior underscores why whisper numbers can be as influential, if not more so, than official [earnings estimates](../e/earnings_estimate.md).

### Trading Strategy

For some traders, leveraging whisper numbers becomes a strategy to [gain](../g/gain.md) an edge. They might subscribe to specialist services that collect and analyze whisper numbers or conduct their own informal surveys and analysis. Additionally, [algorithmic trading](../a/accountability.md) systems and high-frequency trading methodologies are also built around the disparity between official [earnings estimates](../e/earnings_estimate.md) and whisper numbers. These systems can process vast amounts of data and, consequently, are adept at rapidly reacting to the whispered information.

## Reliability and Risks

Despite their influence, whisper numbers come with inherent risks and reliability issues. Since they are not formally audited or regulated, whisper numbers can be prone to misinformation, rumors, and manipulation. A whisper number might circulate within a specific community, gaining traction and creating unwarranted [market](../m/market.md) moves when it has no substantial [basis](../b/basis.md).

### Sources and Quality

The quality of a whisper number often depends on its source. While some whisper numbers might originate from credible [industry](../i/industry.md) insiders or through pattern-based analysis, others could stem from mere [speculation](../s/speculation.md). As such, traders use their discretion and often corroborate whisper numbers with other data points or [market indicators](../m/market_indicators.md) to gauge their authenticity.

## Technology and Whisper Numbers

Advancements in technology have significantly transformed the collection and dissemination of whisper numbers. Trading platforms, blogs, and [social media](../s/social_media.md) play a considerable role in spreading these whispers more widely and quickly than ever before. Furthermore, fintech firms and data analysis companies specialize in scraping public and private sources for [earnings](../e/earnings.md) expectations that can be classified as whisper numbers. Companies like [Estimize](../e/estimize.md) [offer](../o/offer.md) crowd-sourced [earnings estimates](../e/earnings_estimate.md) that often reflect whisper trends. For more information about crowd-sourced [earnings estimates](../e/earnings_estimate.md), you can visit [Estimize's website](https://www.estimize.com).

### Data Analytics and Machine Learning

Modern [data analytics](../d/data_analytics.md) and [machine learning algorithms](../m/machine_learning_algorithms_in_trading.md) enhance the precision of identifying and validating whisper numbers. By sifting through terabytes of data from trading volumes, [social media sentiment](../s/social_media_sentiment.md), and historical [earnings](../e/earnings.md) performance, these algorithms can reveal patterns and validate the credibility of whisper numbers. These techniques [offer](../o/offer.md) significant advantages in processing non-structured data, which often includes the less formal whisper numbers.

## Whisper Numbers vs. Consensus Estimates

The relation between whisper numbers and consensus estimates creates a nuanced [market](../m/market.md) dynamic. Consensus estimates are derived from a broad array of analysts who submit their forecasts for publication. These are often averages or medians of [multiple](../m/multiple.md) forecasts and are more transparent. In contrast, whisper numbers might come from fewer, more selective sources and could integrate intangible insights unavailable to the general analyst community.

### Impacts on Volatility

[Stocks](../s/stock.md) can exhibit increased [volatility](../v/volatility.md) when there is a notable gap between whisper numbers and consensus estimates. For instance, if a consensus estimate is significantly lower than the whisper number, any deviation in actual [earnings](../e/earnings.md) towards either can cause swift price swings. Traders might exploit this [volatility](../v/volatility.md) through [options](../o/options.md), [derivatives](../d/derivatives.md), and other [market](../m/market.md) instruments.

## Case Studies

Several prominent cases illustrate how whisper numbers can shape [market](../m/market.md) outcomes:

### Amazon

Amazon's earning seasons often attract considerable whisper number [speculation](../s/speculation.md) due to its scale and influential [market](../m/market.md) position. If the whisper number for Amazonâ€™s [earnings](../e/earnings.md) is particularly optimistic due to expected high holiday sales and exceeds the consensus estimate, failing to meet this whisper can lead to a stock dip, even if the official [earnings](../e/earnings.md) seem strong.

### Tesla

Tesla's [earnings](../e/earnings.md) are another frequent subject of whisper numbers, fueled by the company's charismatic CEO Elon Musk and the innovative yet volatile nature of its [business](../b/business.md). The whisper numbers around Tesla reflect bullish expectations about its tech ventures and [market](../m/market.md) [expansion](../e/expansion.md). Discrepancies between these whispers and official results are a common trigger for sharp stock price movements.

## Regulatory Concerns

While whisper numbers are not illegal, their unofficial nature poses challenges for [market](../m/market.md) regulators tasked with maintaining fair and transparent [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md). The potential for misinformation means that regulatory bodies like the SEC keep a watchful eye on [market](../m/market.md) activities, including the influence of whisper numbers.

## Conclusion: The Future of Whisper Numbers

The ambiguous status of whisper numbers continues to both intrigue and challenge [market](../m/market.md) participants. While they [offer](../o/offer.md) potential insights into true [market sentiment](../m/market_sentiment.md), their speculative nature and [risk](../r/risk.md) of misinformation [demand](../d/demand.md) careful scrutiny and verification. As technology evolves, it is likely that the methods to gather, validate, and [leverage](../l/leverage.md) whisper numbers [will](../w/will.md) become more sophisticated, thereby integrating informal [market](../m/market.md) expectations more deeply into the fabric of financial trading.

By understanding the dynamics of whisper numbers, investors can [gain](../g/gain.md) better insights into [market](../m/market.md) sentiments and navigate their strategies to optimize returns. However, [due diligence](../d/due_diligence.md) and a cautious approach remain essential to mitigate the inherent risks associated with relying on informal information.

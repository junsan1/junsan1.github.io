# Weighted Returns

In the domain of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), "[weighted](../w/weighted.md) returns" refers to a method of evaluating and balancing the returns of different assets in a portfolio based on several influencing factors, such as [risk](../r/risk.md), [capital](../c/capital.md) invested, and individual [asset](../a/asset.md) performance. This approach helps in creating a diversified portfolio that aims to optimize returns while managing risks effectively. In this detailed guide, we [will](../w/will.md) explore various aspects of [weighted](../w/weighted.md) returns in trading, their importance, methods of calculating them, and tools used by traders to implement [weighted](../w/weighted.md) returns strategies.

## Introduction to Weighted Returns

[Weighted](../w/weighted.md) returns provide a more nuanced perspective than simple average returns by [accounting](../a/accounting.md) for the proportion of each [asset](../a/asset.md) or [trade](../t/trade.md) within an overall [trading strategy](../t/trading_strategy.md) or portfolio. For instance, if a [trader](../t/trader.md) has a portfolio comprising different [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, and other securities, the performance of each [asset](../a/asset.md) would be [weighted](../w/weighted.md) based on its significance in the portfolio, rather than just calculating a simple [average return](../a/average_return.md).

### Importance in Portfolio Management

1. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: [Weighted](../w/weighted.md) returns allow traders to allocate assets in a manner that mitigates [risk](../r/risk.md) while aiming for optimal returns.
2. **[Diversification](../d/diversification.md)**: Proper weighting helps in diversifying the portfolio, reducing the impact of any single [asset](../a/asset.md)'s poor performance.
3. **Benchmarking Performance**: [Weighted](../w/weighted.md) returns help in comparing different portfolios or [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) objectively, understanding their relative performance better.

## Calculating Weighted Returns

Several methods exist for calculating [weighted](../w/weighted.md) returns, each serving different purposes and contexts. We'll discuss some of the most common methods here:

### Simple Weighted Return

The formula for calculating the simple [weighted](../w/weighted.md) [return](../r/return.md) is:

\[
R_w = \sum (w_i \times r_i)
\]

Where:
- \(R_w\) is the [weighted](../w/weighted.md) [return](../r/return.md).
- \(w_i\) is the weight of the i-th [asset](../a/asset.md).
- \(r_i\) is the [return](../r/return.md) of the i-th [asset](../a/asset.md).

### Example

Suppose a portfolio has three assets with the following returns and weights:
- [Asset](../a/asset.md) A: [Return](../r/return.md) = 5%, Weight = 40%
- [Asset](../a/asset.md) B: [Return](../r/return.md) = 10%, Weight = 30%
- [Asset](../a/asset.md) C: [Return](../r/return.md) = 7%, Weight = 30%

The [weighted](../w/weighted.md) [return](../r/return.md) would be:

\[
R_w = (0.40 \times 0.05) + (0.30 \times 0.10) + (0.30 \times 0.07) = 0.02 + 0.03 + 0.021 = 0.071 \text{ or } 7.1\%
\]

### Value-Weighted Return

In a [value](../v/value.md)-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) [return](../r/return.md) calculation, the weights are based on the [market](../m/market.md) values of the individual assets rather than predetermined percentages. 

### Formula

\[
R_{vw} = \frac{\sum (MV_i \times r_i)}{\sum MV_i}
\]

Where:
- \(MV_i\) is the [market value](../m/market_value.md) of the i-th [asset](../a/asset.md).
- \(r_i\) is the [return](../r/return.md) of the i-th [asset](../a/asset.md).

### Example

Assuming a portfolio with the following [market](../m/market.md) values and returns:
- [Asset](../a/asset.md) A: [Market Value](../m/market_value.md) = $150,000, [Return](../r/return.md) = 5%
- [Asset](../a/asset.md) B: [Market Value](../m/market_value.md) = $250,000, [Return](../r/return.md) = 10%
- [Asset](../a/asset.md) C: [Market Value](../m/market_value.md) = $100,000, [Return](../r/return.md) = 7%

The [value](../v/value.md)-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) [return](../r/return.md) is calculated as:

\[
R_{vw} = \frac{(150,000 \times 0.05) + (250,000 \times 0.10) + (100,000 \times 0.07)}{150,000 + 250,000 + 100,000} 
= \frac{7,500 + 25,000 + 7,000}{500,000} 
= \frac{39,500}{500,000}
= 0.079 \text{ or } 7.9\%
\]

### Time-Weighted Return

[Time-weighted returns](../t/time-weighted_returns.md) adjust for the effect of cash flows into and out of the portfolio. This method is especially useful for evaluating the performance of a [portfolio manager](../p/portfolio_manager.md).

### Formula

\[
R_{tw} = \prod_{i=1}^{n} (1 + r_i) - 1
\]

Where:
- \(r_i\) is the [return](../r/return.md) for each sub-period i.

### Example

Assume a portfolio with returns over three periods:
- Period 1: [Return](../r/return.md) = 2%
- Period 2: [Return](../r/return.md) = 3%
- Period 3: [Return](../r/return.md) = -1%

The time-[weighted](../w/weighted.md) [return](../r/return.md) is calculated as:

\[
R_{tw} = (1 + 0.02) \times (1 + 0.03) \times (1 - 0.01) - 1 
= 1.02 \times 1.03 \times 0.99 - 1 
= 1.0431 - 1 
= 0.0431 \text{ or } 4.31\%
\]

## Advanced Concepts in Weighted Returns

### Risk-Adjusted Returns

[Risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted returns measure the [return](../r/return.md) of an investment relative to its [risk](../r/risk.md). Several metrics incorporate weighting to provide a balanced view of performance and [risk](../r/risk.md).

#### Sharpe Ratio

One of the most commonly used metrics, the [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md), adjusts returns by subtracting the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate and dividing by the [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) of returns.

\[
Sharpe \, Ratio = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_p}
\]

Where:
- \(R_p\) is the portfolio [return](../r/return.md).
- \(R_f\) is the [risk](../r/risk.md)-free rate.
- \(\sigma_p\) is the [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) of the portfolio returns.

#### Sortino Ratio

The [Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md) is a variation that focuses on [downside risk](../d/downside_risk.md) rather than total [volatility](../v/volatility.md).

\[
Sortino \, Ratio = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_{p,down}}
\]

Where:
- \(\sigma_{p,down}\) is the [standard deviation](../s/standard_deviation.md) of negative returns.

### Optimization Techniques

#### Mean-Variance Optimization

Developed by [Harry Markowitz](../h/harry_markowitz.md), [mean-variance optimization](../m/mean-variance_optimization.md) is a mathematical framework for assembling a portfolio of assets that has the maximum [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) for a given level of [risk](../r/risk.md).

### Formula

The objective is to maximize the portfolio's [return](../r/return.md) for a given amount of portfolio [risk](../r/risk.md), \( \sigma_p \):

\[
\text{Minimize } \sigma_p^2 = \sum_{i}\sum_{j} w_i w_j \sigma_{i,j}
\]

Subject to:

\[
R_p = \sum_i w_i R_i \quad \text{and} \quad \sum_i w_i = 1
\]

Where:
- \(w_i\) is the weight of the i-th [asset](../a/asset.md).
- \(\sigma_{i,j}\) is the [covariance](../c/covariance.md) between assets i and j.
- \(R_p\) is the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) of the portfolio.
- \(R_i\) is the [expected return](../e/expected_return.md) of the i-th [asset](../a/asset.md).

### Conclusion

[Weighted](../w/weighted.md) returns in trading are crucial for effective [portfolio management](../p/portfolio_management.md) and [risk](../r/risk.md) mitigation. By understanding different methods of calculating [weighted](../w/weighted.md) returns, traders can make informed decisions to balance their portfolios and optimize their investment strategies. Modern financial tools and software simplify the process, enabling traders and portfolio managers to implement sophisticated techniques such as [mean-variance optimization](../m/mean-variance_optimization.md) and [risk](../r/risk.md)-adjusted [performance metrics](../p/performance_metrics.md).

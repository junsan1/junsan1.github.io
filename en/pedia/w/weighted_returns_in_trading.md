# Weighted Returns in Trading

In the domain of [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), "weighted returns" refers to a method of evaluating and balancing the returns of different assets in a portfolio based on several influencing factors, such as risk, capital invested, and individual asset performance. This approach helps in creating a diversified portfolio that aims to optimize returns while managing risks effectively. In this detailed guide, we will explore various aspects of weighted returns in trading, their importance, methods of calculating them, and tools used by traders to implement weighted returns strategies.

## Introduction to Weighted Returns

Weighted returns provide a more nuanced perspective than simple average returns by accounting for the proportion of each asset or trade within an overall trading strategy or portfolio. For instance, if a trader has a portfolio comprising different stocks, bonds, and other securities, the performance of each asset would be weighted based on its significance in the portfolio, rather than just calculating a simple average return.

### Importance in Portfolio Management

1. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Weighted returns allow traders to allocate assets in a manner that mitigates risk while aiming for optimal returns.
2. **Diversification**: Proper weighting helps in diversifying the portfolio, reducing the impact of any single asset's poor performance.
3. **Benchmarking Performance**: Weighted returns help in comparing different portfolios or [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) objectively, understanding their relative performance better.

## Calculating Weighted Returns

Several methods exist for calculating weighted returns, each serving different purposes and contexts. We'll discuss some of the most common methods here:

### Simple Weighted Return

The formula for calculating the simple weighted return is:

\[
R_w = \sum (w_i \times r_i)
\]

Where:
- \(R_w\) is the weighted return.
- \(w_i\) is the weight of the i-th asset.
- \(r_i\) is the return of the i-th asset.

### Example

Suppose a portfolio has three assets with the following returns and weights:
- Asset A: Return = 5%, Weight = 40%
- Asset B: Return = 10%, Weight = 30%
- Asset C: Return = 7%, Weight = 30%

The weighted return would be:

\[
R_w = (0.40 \times 0.05) + (0.30 \times 0.10) + (0.30 \times 0.07) = 0.02 + 0.03 + 0.021 = 0.071 \text{ or } 7.1\%
\]

### Value-Weighted Return

In a value-weighted return calculation, the weights are based on the market values of the individual assets rather than predetermined percentages. 

### Formula

\[
R_{vw} = \frac{\sum (MV_i \times r_i)}{\sum MV_i}
\]

Where:
- \(MV_i\) is the market value of the i-th asset.
- \(r_i\) is the return of the i-th asset.

### Example

Assuming a portfolio with the following market values and returns:
- Asset A: Market Value = $150,000, Return = 5%
- Asset B: Market Value = $250,000, Return = 10%
- Asset C: Market Value = $100,000, Return = 7%

The value-weighted return is calculated as:

\[
R_{vw} = \frac{(150,000 \times 0.05) + (250,000 \times 0.10) + (100,000 \times 0.07)}{150,000 + 250,000 + 100,000} 
= \frac{7,500 + 25,000 + 7,000}{500,000} 
= \frac{39,500}{500,000}
= 0.079 \text{ or } 7.9\%
\]

### Time-Weighted Return

[Time-weighted returns](../t/time-weighted_returns.md) adjust for the effect of cash flows into and out of the portfolio. This method is especially useful for evaluating the performance of a portfolio manager.

### Formula

\[
R_{tw} = \prod_{i=1}^{n} (1 + r_i) - 1
\]

Where:
- \(r_i\) is the return for each sub-period i.

### Example

Assume a portfolio with returns over three periods:
- Period 1: Return = 2%
- Period 2: Return = 3%
- Period 3: Return = -1%

The time-weighted return is calculated as:

\[
R_{tw} = (1 + 0.02) \times (1 + 0.03) \times (1 - 0.01) - 1 
= 1.02 \times 1.03 \times 0.99 - 1 
= 1.0431 - 1 
= 0.0431 \text{ or } 4.31\%
\]

## Tools and Software for Calculating Weighted Returns

## Advanced Concepts in Weighted Returns

### Risk-Adjusted Returns

Risk-adjusted returns measure the return of an investment relative to its risk. Several metrics incorporate weighting to provide a balanced view of performance and risk.

#### Sharpe Ratio

One of the most commonly used metrics, the [Sharpe Ratio](../s/sharpe_ratio.md), adjusts returns by subtracting the risk-free rate and dividing by the standard deviation of returns.

\[
Sharpe \, Ratio = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_p}
\]

Where:
- \(R_p\) is the portfolio return.
- \(R_f\) is the risk-free rate.
- \(\sigma_p\) is the standard deviation of the portfolio returns.

#### Sortino Ratio

The [Sortino Ratio](../s/sortino_ratio.md) is a variation that focuses on downside risk rather than total volatility.

\[
Sortino \, Ratio = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_{p,down}}
\]

Where:
- \(\sigma_{p,down}\) is the standard deviation of negative returns.

### Optimization Techniques

#### Mean-Variance Optimization

Developed by Harry Markowitz, [mean-variance optimization](../m/mean-variance_optimization.md) is a mathematical framework for assembling a portfolio of assets that has the maximum expected return for a given level of risk.

### Formula

The objective is to maximize the portfolio's return for a given amount of portfolio risk, \( \sigma_p \):

\[
\text{Minimize } \sigma_p^2 = \sum_{i}\sum_{j} w_i w_j \sigma_{i,j}
\]

Subject to:

\[
R_p = \sum_i w_i R_i \quad \text{and} \quad \sum_i w_i = 1
\]

Where:
- \(w_i\) is the weight of the i-th asset.
- \(\sigma_{i,j}\) is the covariance between assets i and j.
- \(R_p\) is the expected return of the portfolio.
- \(R_i\) is the expected return of the i-th asset.

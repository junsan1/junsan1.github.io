# Wraparound Mortgage

A wraparound [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) is a type of secondary [financing](../f/financing.md) for the purchase of [real property](../r/real_property.md). It involves a [lender](../l/lender.md), typically the seller of the property, extending a [loan](../l/loan.md) to the buyer that "wraps around" an existing [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) still owed by the seller. The buyer makes a [payment](../p/payment.md) to the seller which covers both the seller's existing [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) and any additional amount needed to meet the terms of the new [loan](../l/loan.md) agreement. Essentially, the seller continues to be liable for their original [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) while also collecting payments from the buyer, oftentimes at a higher [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md), and making a [profit](../p/profit.md) on the difference.

## How Wraparound Mortgages Work

In a wraparound [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md), the seller undertakes a new [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) which includes the remaining balance from their own [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) and incorporates an additional figure based on the agreed [loan](../l/loan.md) terms with the buyer. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how a wraparound [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) functions:

1. **Existing [Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md)**: The seller has an outstanding primary [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) on their property.
2. **[Negotiation](../n/negotiation.md)**: A buyer and seller agree on the terms of a new [loan](../l/loan.md), often one that includes a higher [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) than the existing [loan](../l/loan.md).
3. **Contract**: The seller creates a wraparound [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) document which includes the terms of the new [loan](../l/loan.md) and outlines the [payment](../p/payment.md) schedule.
4. **[Payment](../p/payment.md)**: The buyer makes regular payments to the seller, who in turn uses a portion of those payments to continue servicing their own original [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md).
5. **[Profit Margin](../p/profit_margin.md)**: The seller profits from the difference between the [interest](../i/interest.md) rates of the original [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) and the wraparound [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md).

For example, if the seller's existing [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) has an [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) of 5% and the wraparound [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) is at 7%, the seller earns a 2% [profit](../p/profit.md) on the unpaid amount of the original [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md).

## Legal Structure and Documentation

The legal framework for a wraparound [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) requires meticulous documentation to be clear on terms, protect both parties' interests, and comply with local [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) laws. Key documents involved include:

- **[Promissory Note](../p/promissory_note.md)**: Outlines the terms of the [loan](../l/loan.md), including the amount, [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md), and [repayment](../r/repayment.md) schedule.
- **[Mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) or [Deed](../d/deed.md) of [Trust](../t/trust.md)**: Records the buyer's [obligations](../o/obligation.md) and grants the [lender](../l/lender.md) (seller) a [lien](../l/lien.md) on the property, secondary to the original [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md).
- **Purchase Agreement**: An agreement detailing the [sale](../s/sale.md) of the property and terms specific to the wraparound [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md).

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages
- **Easier Qualifying**: Buyers who may not qualify for traditional [financing](../f/financing.md) can often negotiate wraparound mortgages directly with sellers.
- **Lower Closing Costs**: Wraparound mortgages typically involve lower closing costs than traditional mortgages.
- **[Profit](../p/profit.md) Potential for Sellers**: Sellers can potentially earn a higher [return](../r/return.md) due to the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) difference.
- **Quicker Transactions**: Since they don't always require traditional [lender](../l/lender.md) involvement, wraparound mortgages can be faster to arrange.

### Disadvantages
- **[Risk](../r/risk.md) to Seller**: If the buyer defaults, the seller must continue the payments to the original [lender](../l/lender.md) or [risk](../r/risk.md) [foreclosure](../f/foreclosure.md) on the property.
- **Complexity**: Wraparound mortgages can be legally and financially complex, requiring diligent oversight and careful structuring.
- **Existing [Lender](../l/lender.md)’s Due on [Sale](../s/sale.md) Clause**: If the existing [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) has a "due on [sale](../s/sale.md)" clause, the original [lender](../l/lender.md) could [demand](../d/demand.md) immediate [repayment](../r/repayment.md) of the outstanding [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) when the property is sold.

## Example Scenarios

### Example 1: Seller’s Perspective
A seller with an existing [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) balance of $100,000 at 5% [interest](../i/interest.md) agrees to a wraparound [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) with a buyer for $150,000 at 7% [interest](../i/interest.md).
- The seller's payments on the original [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) may be about $536 per month.
- The buyer's payments on the wraparound [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) might be approximately $998 per month.
- The seller profits from the difference in monthly payments and an [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) spread, [netting](../n/netting.md) an additional $462 per month from the buyer.

### Example 2: Buyer’s Perspective
A buyer, unable to secure traditional [financing](../f/financing.md), negotiates a wraparound [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) with a seller.
- The buyer gets access to property [financing](../f/financing.md) that might otherwise be unattainable.
- The total [loan](../l/loan.md) includes the seller’s existing [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) plus the additional amount financed.
- The buyer might pay a higher [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md), but achieves ownership and starts building [equity](../e/equity.md) in the property.

## Wraparound Mortgage vs. Other Financing Methods

### Comparison with Traditional Mortgages:
- **[Credit](../c/credit.md) Requirements**: Wraparound mortgages often have less stringent [credit](../c/credit.md) requirements compared to [bank](../b/bank.md) mortgages.
- **[Interest](../i/interest.md) Rates**: While wraparound mortgages carry higher [interest](../i/interest.md) rates, they allow flexibility in structuring the deal.

### Comparison with Lease-to-Own:
- **Ownership**: In wraparound mortgages, ownership transfers immediately, whereas lease-to-own arrangements usually delay ownership until all payments are completed.
- **[Financing](../f/financing.md) Structure**: Wraparound mortgages are a form of [seller financing](../s/seller_financing.md) specific to purchasing, while lease-to-own can apply to rental agreements transitioning to ownership.

## Regulatory Considerations

Wraparound mortgages are subject to local [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) laws which vary by jurisdiction. Key regulatory points include:
- **[Disclosure](../d/disclosure.md) [Obligations](../o/obligation.md)**: Sellers must disclose terms and conditions transparently to avoid legal disputes.
- **Due on [Sale](../s/sale.md) Clauses**: As mentioned, original lenders might invoke these clauses requiring prompt [repayment](../r/repayment.md) upon property [sale](../s/sale.md).
- **State-Specific Legislation**: Some states have specific laws governing wraparound mortgages to protect against potential abuse or [fraud](../f/fraud.md).

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Beneficial Wraparound Mortgage
A seller in California, with an existing low-[interest](../i/interest.md) [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md), utilizes a wraparound [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) to sell their property quickly. The buyer, a small [business](../b/business.md) owner with inconsistent [income](../i/income.md), benefits from the less rigorous qualification process. The seller enjoys a [profit](../p/profit.md) from the [interest rate](../i/interest_rate.md) difference, and the buyer benefits from immediate [home](../h/home.md) ownership and more favorable terms than they could secure through traditional avenues.

### Case Study 2: Risky Wraparound Mortgage
In Texas, a seller and buyer agree to a wraparound [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) without fully understanding the ramifications of the existing [lender](../l/lender.md)'s due-on-[sale](../s/sale.md) clause. Six months into the agreement, the original [lender](../l/lender.md) demands full [repayment](../r/repayment.md) of the outstanding [mortgage](../m/mortgage.md) balance, forcing the seller to either [refinance](../r/refinance.md) or face [foreclosure](../f/foreclosure.md) risks. This case underscores the importance of understanding all terms and potential pitfalls.

## Conclusion

Wraparound mortgages present unique opportunities and challenges for buyers and sellers. They [offer](../o/offer.md) flexibility and potential financial benefits, particularly for individuals who may struggle with traditional [financing](../f/financing.md) routes. However, the complexity and potential risks require thorough consideration and consulting with financial and legal professionals to navigate successfully. Understanding the structure, benefits, and risks is key to leveraging wraparound mortgages effectively in [real estate](../r/real_estate.md) transactions.

# Western Account

The term **Western Account** is often used within the context of [finance](../f/finance.md) and trading, specifically referring to a type of [syndicate](../s/syndicate.md) account used in securities [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md). A Western Account, also known as a Divided Account, contrasts with an Eastern Account (or [Undivided Account](../u/undivided_account.md)) in terms of how responsibilities and liabilities are allocated among the [syndicate](../s/syndicate.md) members.

## Overview

A **[syndicate](../s/syndicate.md)** is a group of [investment banks](../i/investment_bank_(ib).md) or underwriters that come together temporarily to [handle](../h/handle.md) the issuance and [distribution](../d/distribution.md) of a new [security](../s/security.md) [offering](../o/offering.md). The primary purpose of forming a [syndicate](../s/syndicate.md) is to pool the financial resources and spread the [risk](../r/risk.md) among several institutions.

In a Western Account, each [syndicate](../s/syndicate.md) member is responsible only for the amount of the [issue](../i/issue.md) they have committed to underwrite. If a portion of the [issue](../i/issue.md) remains unsold, only the underwriters who committed to that portion bear the [risk](../r/risk.md) of the unsold securities. This arrangement ensures that each member’s [liability](../l/liability.md) is determined strictly by their own share of the [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md).

### Key Characteristics

1. **Divided [Liability](../l/liability.md)**: Each member is accountable solely for their own portion. If they are unable to sell their allocated share, they cannot compel other members to absorb these unsold securities.
   
2. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: The [risk](../r/risk.md) of unsold securities is distributed among the members based on their committed [shares](../s/shares.md), making it a preferred structure for underwriters who want to manage individual exposure.

3. **Securities [Offering](../o/offering.md)**: This structure is typically used in [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) various types of securities, including [stocks](../s/stock.md), bonds, and other financial instruments.

## How it Works

### Formation

1. **Lead [Underwriter](../u/underwriter.md)**: Typically, a lead [underwriter](../u/underwriter.md) (or bookrunner) is appointed to manage the public issuance and regulatory compliance aspects. The lead [underwriter](../u/underwriter.md) forms the [syndicate](../s/syndicate.md) and allocates specific portions of the issuance to each [syndicate](../s/syndicate.md) member.
   
2. **Allocation**: Each member in a Western Account agrees to underwrite a specific portion of the securities being issued. The allocation is predefined and documented in the [syndicate](../s/syndicate.md) agreement.

### Underwriting Process

1. Once the [syndicate](../s/syndicate.md) is formed, the securities can be offered to investors.
2. Each [syndicate](../s/syndicate.md) member is responsible for selling their allocated portion. 
3. Success of the issuance is contingent upon each member’s ability to distribute their [shares](../s/shares.md).
4. Should a member [fail](../f/fail.md) to sell their entire portion, they bear the financial [liability](../l/liability.md) for any unsold [shares](../s/shares.md).

### Case Example

To illustrate, consider a [corporate bond](../c/corporate_bond.md) issuance where an entity needs to raise $500 million. The lead [underwriter](../u/underwriter.md) decides to form a [syndicate](../s/syndicate.md) with five member firms, each taking on $100 million of the issuance. If one of the [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) firms is unable to sell their $100 million allocation, they must manage the unsold portion themselves and cannot pass this [liability](../l/liability.md) onto the other four firms.

## Comparison with Eastern Account

The primary distinction of a Western Account lies in the [risk](../r/risk.md) [distribution](../d/distribution.md) model. In contrast, an **Eastern Account**, or [Undivided Account](../u/undivided_account.md), operates under shared [liability](../l/liability.md) among [syndicate](../s/syndicate.md) members. If any portion of the issuance remains unsold, the responsibility and subsequent [liability](../l/liability.md) are proportionately shared by all members based on their initial [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) commitment.

### Key Differences

- **Western Account (Divided Account)**: Each member is only responsible for their own portion and bears the individual [risk](../r/risk.md) of unsold securities.
- **Eastern Account ([Undivided Account](../u/undivided_account.md))**: All members share the [risk](../r/risk.md) of any unsold portion collectively, redistributing the liabilities among themselves according to predetermined proportions.

## Benefits and Drawbacks

### Benefits of Western Account

- **[Limited Liability](../l/limited_liability.md)**: Members can control and predict their maximum exposure to unsold securities.
- **Autonomy**: Enables [syndicate](../s/syndicate.md) members to operate independently regarding the [sale](../s/sale.md) of their allocated portion.
- **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Each [firm](../f/firm.md) can employ its own [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) strategies without relying on the performance of others.

### Drawbacks of Western Account

- **Self-Reliance**: Members must have [robust](../r/robust.md) sales and [distribution](../d/distribution.md) capabilities, as they cannot rely on other [syndicate](../s/syndicate.md) members to cover unsold portions.
- **[Risk](../r/risk.md) of Unsold Securities**: Higher [risk](../r/risk.md) for individual members, as struggling firms cannot transfer part of the burden to more successful ones.

## Practical Implications

### Corporate Finance

Corporations considering an [issue](../i/issue.md) of securities often deliberate between syndicates using Western versus Eastern Account structures based on [market](../m/market.md) conditions, the nature of the [security](../s/security.md), and the [risk tolerance](../r/risk_tolerance.md) of the [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) firms involved. 

### Investment Banks

[Investment banks](../i/investment_bank_(ib).md) analyze the size, [scope](../s/scope.md), and [risk](../r/risk.md) associated with the [offering](../o/offering.md) to determine which [syndicate](../s/syndicate.md) account structure aligns best with their financial strategies and capabilities. For less [liquid](../l/liquid.md) or riskier securities, a Western Account might be more appropriate to ensure controlled [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) and specified [liability](../l/liability.md).

### Market Dynamics

[Market dynamics](../m/market_dynamics.md) can influence the choice of the account structure. During bullish markets with high [investor](../i/investor.md) [demand](../d/demand.md), underwriters might prefer a Western Account since the [risk](../r/risk.md) of unsold portions is minimal. Conversely, in bearish markets, an Eastern Account could distribute [risk](../r/risk.md) more equitably among [syndicate](../s/syndicate.md) members.

## Real-World Example

### Case of Initial Public Offerings (IPOs)

Consider several real-world IPOs managed by global financial institutions like Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, and Citigroup. These institutions often form syndicates to distribute new [shares](../s/shares.md) to the public.

During Facebook's IPO in 2012, a [syndicate](../s/syndicate.md) of over 30 financial institutions managed the [offering](../o/offering.md). Each institution handled a portion of the [shares](../s/shares.md) to be issued. In a Western Account structure, if one member failed to sell their allocated portion, they would retain those [shares](../s/shares.md) and face the [market risk](../m/market_risk.md) individually.

## Conclusion

The Western Account is a specific type of [underwriting](../u/underwriting.md) [syndicate](../s/syndicate.md) structure that ensures members are only responsible for their allocated portion of securities, allowing for distinct [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) and predictability of liabilities. Its use is critical in [financial markets](../f/financial_market.md), particularly in the context of seasoned offerings and IPOs, providing [investment banks](../i/investment_bank_(ib).md) with a feasible pathway to manage [financial exposure](../f/financial_exposure.md) and distribute new securities efficiently.

# Wave Theory

Wave theory, also known as [Elliott Wave Theory](../e/elliott_wave_theory.md), is a form of [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) that is used to analyze financial [market cycles](../m/market_cycles.md) and forecast market trends by identifying extremes in investor psychology, highs and lows in prices, and other collective activities. This theory was developed by Ralph Nelson Elliott in the 1930s. Through a detailed study of 75 years of stock market data, Elliott discovered that stock markets, thought to behave in a somewhat chaotic manner, actually traded in repetitive cycles. These cycles were discovered to be a reflection of the predominant emotions of investors and traders over time.

## Key Concepts of Wave Theory

### Elliott Waves
Elliott proposed that market prices unfold in specific patterns, which he called waves. The two main types of waves he identified are impulse waves and corrective waves.

- **Impulse Waves**: These are waves that move in the direction of the prevailing trend and are composed of five smaller waves. In a bull market, the impulse wave will be moving upwards and can be counted as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

- **Corrective Waves**: These waves move against the main trend and are composed of three smaller waves, typically labeled A, B, and C. In a bull market, the corrective waves move downwards.

### Wave Degrees
Wave theory is fractal in nature, which means waves can be subdivided into smaller waves that exhibit the same wave patterns. The degrees of waves are:
- **Grand Supercycle**: This spans multiple centuries.
- **Supercycle**: Spanning several decades (e.g., 40–70 years).
- **Cycle**: Usually lasts one year to several years.
- **Primary**: Typically lasts a few months to a couple of years.
- **Intermediate**: Lasting weeks to months.
- **Minor**: Usually several weeks.
- **Minute**: Lasting days.
- **Minuette**: Spanning hours.
- **Sub-Minuette**: Spanning minutes.

### Rules and Guidelines of Wave Theory
Elliott laid down three cardinal rules for interpreting the wave structure:
1. Wave 2 never retraces more than 100% of wave 1.
2. Wave 3 is never the shortest of the three impulse waves (wave 1, wave 3, wave 5).
3. Wave 4 does not overlap with the price territory of wave 1, except in the rare case of a diagonal triangle formation.

### Fibonacci Relationships
Elliott noted the Fibonacci sequence’s influence on the wave count. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The common sequence is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, etc. The golden ratio, approximately 1.618, is also a critical component in analyzing wave lengths. Waves often form in lengths that are Fibonacci numbers and their extensions or retracements.

## Application in Algo Trading
[Algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), or algo trading, uses computer programs and systems to trade securities by following a defined set of instructions, known as an algorithm. Wave Theory can be incorporated into algo [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md) to predict potential reversals and continuations in financial markets. By programming the rules and structures of [Elliott Wave Theory](../e/elliott_wave_theory.md) into [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md), traders can automate the recognition of wave patterns and make informed trading decisions.

### Example of Algorithm Implementation
A simple application could involve creating an algorithm that identifies and trades based on wave patterns:
1. **Data Collection**: Collect historical price data for the asset.
2. **Wave Identification**: Implement an algorithm to identify possible waves. This could include functions to detect the formation of impulse and corrective waves.
3. **[Pattern Recognition](../p/pattern_recognition.md)**: Use [pattern recognition](../p/pattern_recognition.md) to determine the current position within a wave cycle.
4. **Decision Making**: Based on the identified pattern and wave count, make trading decisions (e.g., enter a trade during a wave 2 retracement, exit at the peak of wave 5).
5. **[Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Include stops and limits based on Fibonacci retracement and extension levels.

### Tools and Software
There are several tools and software platforms available that help traders apply Wave Theory to algo trading. Some of them include:

- **Elliott Wave International**: They provide detailed analysis and educational resources on applying [Elliott Wave Theory](../e/elliott_wave_theory.md). Their software tool, EWAVES, automates wave counting and analysis. [Website](https://www.elliottwave.com)
- **[TradingView](../t/tradingview.md)**: A popular [technical analysis](../t/technical_analysis.md) platform offering various charting tools, including Elliott Wave drawing tools and script customization for algo trading. [Website](https://www.tradingview.com)
- **MetaTrader 4/5 (MT4/MT5)**: These platforms support custom indicators and scripts, which can be coded using MQL4/MQL5 to identify and trade waves. [Website](https://www.metatrader4.com)

## Criticisms and Challenges

### Subjectivity
One of the primary criticisms of [Elliott Wave Theory](../e/elliott_wave_theory.md) is its subjectivity. Analysts may interpret the same market differently, leading to different wave counts.

### Complexity
Using Wave Theory effectively requires a deep understanding and experience, which can be difficult for novice traders.

### Market Conditions
Wave patterns might not always be clear, especially in volatile or irregular markets. This makes it challenging to create algorithms that can consistently identify and act on these patterns accurately.

## Conclusion
Wave Theory offers a potent framework for understanding [market cycles](../m/market_cycles.md) and predicting future price movements. By integrating Wave Theory into [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md) systems, traders can create automated strategies that leverage [historical price patterns](../h/historical_price_patterns.md) and collective investor behavior. However, the subjective nature of wave identification and the complexity involved mean that successful implementation requires careful programming, robust data analysis, and constant tweaking to adapt to changing market conditions.

# Weighted Least Squares (WLS)

Weighted Least Squares (WLS) is an important statistical method used to perform [linear regression](../l/linear_regression.md) when the standard assumptions of ordinary least squares (OLS) are not met. Specifically, WLS addresses situations where heteroscedasticity is present, that is, when the variance of the errors varies across observations. It assigns different weights to different data points based on the certainty of the measurements, thereby improving the accuracy and reliability of the regression model.

## Introduction to Regression Analysis

[Regression analysis](../r/regression_analysis.md) is a statistical technique for examining the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The most common form of [regression analysis](../r/regression_analysis.md) is [linear regression](../l/linear_regression.md), where the relationship is modeled by a linear function.

### Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)

In OLS regression, the goal is to estimate the parameters of a linear equation:
\[ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \ldots + \beta_p X_p + \epsilon \]

Where:
- \(Y\) is the dependent variable,
- \(\beta_0, \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_p\) are the coefficients,
- \(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_p\) are the independent variables,
- and \(\epsilon\) represents the error term.

The OLS method minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed and predicted values:
\[ \min \sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - \hat{Y_i})^2 \]

### Assumptions of OLS

OLS regression assumes:
1. **Linearity**: The relationship between the independent and dependent variables is linear.
2. **Independence**: Observations are independent of each other.
3. **Homoscedasticity**: The variance of error terms is constant across observations.
4. **Normality**: The error terms are normally distributed.

## When to Use Weighted Least Squares (WLS)

WLS is particularly useful when the assumption of homoscedasticity is violated. Heteroscedasticity occurs when the variance of the error terms varies across observations, which can undermine the reliability of OLS estimates.

### Identifying Heteroscedasticity

Heteroscedasticity can be identified through:
- **Residual Plots**: Plotting residuals against fitted values can reveal patterns indicating non-constant variance.
- **Formal Tests**: Tests such as the Breusch-Pagan test help formally detect heteroscedasticity.

## Concept of Weighted Least Squares

Unlike OLS, which treats all data points equally, WLS assigns weights to each data point according to the inverse of their variance:
\[ \mathbf{W} = \text{diag}\left(\frac{1}{\sigma_1^2}, \frac{1}{\sigma_2^2}, \ldots, \frac{1}{\sigma_n^2}\right) \]

The WLS estimation minimizes the weighted sum of squared residuals:
\[ \min \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i (Y_i - \hat{Y_i})^2 \]

Where each weight \( w_i \) is typically \( \frac{1}{\sigma_i^2} \), with \( \sigma_i^2 \) being the variance of the \( i \)-th observation's error term.

## Mathematical Formulation of WLS

Consider the [linear regression](../l/linear_regression.md) model:
\[ \mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{X} \boldsymbol{\beta} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon} \]

With \( \mathbf{Y} \) being the vector of observed values, \( \mathbf{X} \) the matrix of independent variables, \( \boldsymbol{\beta} \) the vector of regression coefficients, and \( \boldsymbol{\epsilon} \) the error terms.

The WLS estimates \( \boldsymbol{\beta} \) by solving:
\[ \left( \mathbf{X}^\top \mathbf{W} \mathbf{X} \right) \boldsymbol{\beta} = \mathbf{X}^\top \mathbf{W} \mathbf{Y} \]

Where \( \mathbf{W} \) is the diagonal weight matrix.

## Steps in Performing WLS

1. **Diagnose Heteroscedasticity**: Using residual plots or formal tests.
2. **Determine Weights**: Based on the inverse of variances of error terms.
3. **Transform the Data**: Adjust the observations according to the determined weights.
4. **Fit the Model**: Using the weighted data, estimate the coefficients.
5. **Evaluate the Model**: Check residuals and other diagnostics to ensure the model’s validity.

## Application in Algo Trading

Algo trading, or [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), involves using algorithms to automate [trading strategies](../t/trading_strategies.md). In such a dynamic environment, accurate modeling of the relationships between various financial indicators is crucial.

### Use of WLS in Algo Trading

1. **Address Heteroscedasticity**: Financial data often exhibits heteroscedasticity due to varying market volatility. WLS helps in creating more reliable models.
2. **Improve Model Accuracy**: By assigning appropriate weights, WLS improves the precision of the predictive models used in [trading algorithms](../t/trading_algorithms.md).
3. **Enhance [Risk Management](../r/risk_management.md)**: Better model accuracy translates to more effective [risk management](../r/risk_management.md) strategies in trading.

## Practical Example

Consider a financial analyst using WLS to model the relationship between a stock’s return (dependent variable) and various financial indicators (independent variables). Assume heteroscedasticity is detected in the residuals.

### Steps Followed

1. **Detect Heteroscedasticity**: Using a Breusch-Pagan test, significant heteroscedasticity is detected.
2. **Determine Weights**: The weights are determined based on the inverse of the estimated variances from the residuals.
3. **Transform Data**: Each observation of the dependent and independent variables is scaled accordingly.
4. **Fit WLS Model**: The WLS regression is performed to estimate the relationship accurately.
5. **Validate Model**: Residuals are checked to ensure heteroscedasticity is adequately addressed.

By incorporating WLS, the analyst achieves a model that better adjusts to varying volatility, enhancing the trading strategy's reliability.

## Conclusion

Weighted Least Squares is a powerful extension of ordinary least squares, providing robustness to heteroscedasticity and improving model accuracy. Its application is particularly valuable in fields like [algorithmic trading](../a/algorithmic_trading.md), where precision and reliability are paramount. Understanding and applying WLS equips analysts and traders with the tools to address real-world data complexities, leading to more informed and effective decision-making.
